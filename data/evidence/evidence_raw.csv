Marathon Reveals An Absolutely Stacked Voice Cast,"<p>In the lead up to its release on March 5, Bungie has revealed the full voice cast for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/"">Marathon</a>--and it is stacked. Featuring fan-favorites from recent hits like Baldur's Gate 3 and Clair Obscur, TV sci-fi stars, and other notable gaming voices, Bungie is clearly going all-in on Marathon's voice acting.</p><p>In a blog post, Bungie revealed the 33 names that make up the English voice cast for Marathon, many of them instantly recognisable for fans of games and sci-fi. The list includes the voices of some of our favorite Baldur's Gate 3 companions including Jennifer English (Shadowheart), Neil Newbon (Astarion), Samantha Béart (Karlach), and Tracy Wiles (Jaheira). Also from the realm of RPGs are Ben Starr and Rich Keeble, who lent their voices to Verso and Monoco respectively in Clair Obscur.</p><div data-embed-type=""tweet"" data-src=""https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2013321840286974038"" data-has-image=""true""><blockquote align=""center"" class=""twitter-tweet"" data-conversation=""none"" data-mce-disable-toolbar=""true""><p dir=""ltr"">Announcing Marathon's English voice cast.

Marathon's Recommended System Requirements Have Been Revealed,"<p>Bungie announced this week that its new extraction shooter Marathon will <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-launches-on-march-5-will-cost-40/1100-6537486/"">release on March 5</a>, and also revealed some other important pre-release information--including a set of updated system requirements.</p><p>While Bungie released PC specs for Marathon ahead of the game's first closed alpha last year, it only gave the minimum system requirements. Those haven't changed ahead of Marathon's full release, but we now also have a set of recommended specs to size up against.</p><h2>Marathon PC Specs</h2><h3>Minimum</h3><ul><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i5-6600 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 8 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti (4 GB) / AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT (4 GB) / Intel Arc A580 (8 GB, with ReBAR on)</li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 12</li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection</li></ul><h3>Recommended</h3><ul><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i5-10400 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce GTX 2060 (6 GB) / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT (8 GB) / Intel Arc A770 (16 GB, with ReBAR on)</li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 12</li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection</li></ul><p>While the current set of specs doesn't specify a target frame rate or resolution, it shouldn't be hard for most decent rigs to get a good experience out of Marathon. With reasonable minimum specs, even those with older or less powerful PCs should be able to manage the game on lower settings, too.

The actor has new film roles lined up, but right now, his most pressing concern is avoiding getting steamrolled by the notorious Lynel mini-bosses in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p><p>In an interview, Fraser was asked whether he was playing any video games, and he explained that he was ""still stuck"" on the critically acclaimed 2017 Zelda game. ""I want to know how to get better weapons without getting my ass kicked by all the Lynels,"" <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@ign/video/7596135484670184717"">Fraser said to IGN</a>, while also lamenting that there simply aren't enough bomb-flowers in the game. While his interviewer suggested he consult online guides, Fraser responded that he was looking to beat the game the old-fashioned way, without relying on walkthroughs.</p><p>The next film that Fraser will appear in, Pressure, will see him portray Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower, one of the key leaders of the Allied forces during World War 2 and the 34th US President who served from 1953-61. The actor also announced last year that he would reprise his role as Rick O'Connell in the fourth Mummy movie.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/brendan-fraser-comeback-era-includes-getting-wrecked-in-the-legend-of-zelda/1100-6537485/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-20T12:23:58.037812
Marvel Rivals Developer Is Preparing To Crack Down On This New Exploit,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/"">Marvel Rivals</a> introduced an upgrade to its hero proficiency system last week, allowing players to earn new rewards. Many of these rewards--including the brag-worthy Lord icons--require a considerable amount of grinding to achieve, which has led to the rise of ""Lord farming"" amongst the playerbase.</p><p>Essentially, players aren't moving after they spawn into a match, as they spam their abilities to earn proficiency points safely. This has led to some <em>very </em>one-sided matches, and developer NetEase says it'll address this problem in a future update. There's no date yet for when this update will go live, but players can expect some severe penalties if they're caught farming stats this way.</p><p>""Recently, we've noticed that some players are exploiting matches by remaining stationary and repeatedly farming stats to gain hero proficiency points,"" <a href=""https://x.com/marvelrivals/status/2013176993383133552"">NetEase wrote online</a>. ""This behavior disrupts normal gameplay and seriously affects the match experience of other players. To address this, we are planning to introduce a combat behavior detection system.

Valve Updates AI Disclosure Guidelines To Allow For AI-Powered Tools,"<p>Valve has made changes to its AI-disclosure guidelines, removing the need for studios to disclose whether or not games have been developed with AI-powered tools and putting more emphasis on AI-generated assets.</p><p>The change, which was pointed out by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/simoncarless_interestingly-pc-video-game-platform-steam-activity-7417944215675908096-OGNg/"">Simon Carless on LinkedIn</a>, suggests that Valve is no longer concerned by the use of AI tools that assist development, stating, ""Efficiency gains through the use of [AI-powered dev tools] is not the focus of this section."" These tools could included a variety of things, such as AI-generated transcripts of meetings to code helpers that have become prevalent in most programming environments.</p><p>Valve states the the aim of its disclosure policy is to inform players when AI is used to generate content, from marketing and conceptual assets to in-game ones that players will interact with. Developers are able to specify what assets have been generated and indicate, via a single checkbox, whether or not players will interact with AI-generated content during gameplay, be it images, audio, or other content.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-updates-ai-disclosure-guidelines-to-allow-for-ai-powered-tools/1100-6537483/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-20T12:23:58.037812

A good friend, though, will cut that work in half. Satisfactory offers both peer-to-peer multiplayer and server-based multiplayer, and each of them has their disadvantages. We'll talk about how to get each of them going here.</p><p dir=""ltr"">There are three ways to host games in Satisfactory: Peer-to-peer games, self-hosted servers and rented servers. Peer-to-peer and self-hosted server options are both free, while a rented server option will have a monthly cost associated with it.

How to Use Satisfactory's Smart Splitters,"<p>Once you make it past the early game in <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/satisfactory/"">Satisfactory</a>, your production lines will skyrocket in complexity. As the number of items you're producing goes from a dozen to <em>dozens</em>, so will the number of conveyor belts carting all of that around. Mastering Smart Splitters will be a crucial part of advancing in Satisfactory, keeping your production lines navigable and easy to understand.</p><h3 dir=""ltr"">What is a Smart Splitter?</h3><p dir=""ltr"">The function of a regular splitter is fairly obvious--it splits a single conveyor belt into as many as three belts. That's great for a smelter cranking out more ingots than any single production line needs, such as having one smelter sending ingots to make plates, rods, and screws. There's no configuration needed here, either. It's just plug-and-play.</p><p dir=""ltr"">So what makes a Smart Splitter smart? Smart Splitters are programmable, allowing you to determine which items on a belt go where. There are programmable splitters, too, that do the same thing but at a higher level, allowing you to sort more than three different outputs.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-use-satisfactorys-smart-splitters/1100-6537226/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-20T12:23:58.037812

Some Of Monster Hunter Wilds' PC Issues Are Caused By Weird Glitch,"<p>Earlier this month, some <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/"">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> players reported that the game actually performed better on Steam when it has more DLC installed. Word about that improvement spread quickly among the Monster Hunter Wilds community, but the real reason for the game's improvement isn't about whether the game has DLC.

According to the report, when the option for DLC content was offered, the game itself ""checked for DLC thousands upon thousands of times, adding to the CPU load of an already over-burdened processor"" in less than a minute.</p><p>Essentially, this recurring issue in the hub area near a Support Desk Felynes has nothing to do with the DLC itself; it's happening because the game is constantly checking for DLC.

"Fallout Season 2 Viewership Numbers Are Way Down, But There Is An Obvious Reason Why","<p>The newest Nielsen ratings have arrived, showing a gigantic drop-off for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-episode-release-date-schedule/1100-6536675/"">Fallout Season 2</a> compared to Fallout Season 1. However, there is an obvious explanation for the dip.</p><p>According to <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/streaming-ratings-dec-15-21-2025-1236475572/"">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Fallout viewership reached 794 million minutes on Prime Video for the week of December 15-21, which covers when Season 2 debuted on December 16. Season 1 racked up 2.9 billion minutes of streaming time during its own opening week in April 2024. That's a 72% decrease, but the massive downturn was no doubt attributable to how the two seasons were released.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECI3eCAxRGw"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"" data-video-start=""14"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ECI3eCAxRGw?start=14"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Season 1, many may recall, was released in a binge format with all episodes arriving at the same time.

Helldivers 2 Is Letting Players Vote On Which Planet Gets Hit By Its Not-A-Death-Star,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/"">Helldivers 2</a> prides itself on the concept of Managed Democracy, and in the latest example of crowdsourced decision-making, the game is asking players to choose a planet to blow up with a shiny new not-a-Death-Star superweapon. Fortunately, these planets aren't home to any brave Helldivers and are instead populated by the undemocratic factions that refuse to yield to Super Earth.</p><p>The latest twist in the Helldivers 2 saga kicked off last week when Super Earth announced that it was upgrading the Democracy Space Station with the Star of Peace weapon.

Hytale Guides Hub,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/hytale/"">Hytale</a> is the long-in-development <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/"">Minecraft</a> competitor from the team at Hypixel. What was once a very popular Minecraft server is now its own standalone experience that rivals Mojang's massive survival game in some ways, with plans to challenge it a lot more over time, no doubt. If you're jumping into Hytale to see what all the hype is about, you'll benefit from our guides on the game, which tackle the burning questions players may have as the game is now in early access.</p><h2>Starter guides</h2><p>The guides we have on Hytale for now all comfortably fit under one category: starter guides. This is because the game has only just launched and, by the studio's own admission, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hytale-console-version-planned-but-developers-want-to-focus-on-making-a-good-game-first/1100-6537393/"">there's plenty of work still to be done</a>.</p><p>For now, you can jump into Hytale and enjoy an experience much like the early hours of Minecraft.

All Armor Crafting Recipes In Hytale,"<p>There are few things more important in <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/hytale/"">Hytale</a> than the armor your character equips. Armor can save you from dying to a dangerous mob when you're exploring at night or in a dark cave. It also plays a large part in how your character looks, which does play a factor in your experience if you play in third person. While you might have already figured out how to craft the most basic armor in Hytale, there are several more advanced options that offer stronger protection from mobs.</p><p>The guide below shows you all of the current crafting recipes we have for armor in Hytale.

You also have a slot for a shield, but that's not necessarily armor, so we won't be covering those crafting recipes.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-armor-crafting-recipes-in-hytale/1100-6537448/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-20T12:23:58.037812

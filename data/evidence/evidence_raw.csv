Iron Lung's success can almost certainly be attributed to its links with mega-popular YouTuber Mark Edward Fischbach - better known as Markiplier - for whom the project's clearly been a labour of love, given he not only self-funded it, but wrote it, directed it, and starred in it too.

It's great because there's often no meaningful alteration in tone to tell you something has changed. Cats are frequently introduced into conversation the same way a person might start talking about an intermittently beloved uncle who's just out of prison. Cats are often delightful reprobates and oddballs. They're needlessly, inventively cruel, or inhumanly calm and forbearing, or they're ostentatiously silly. One will sit on the landing and swipe at everyone. Another will hide under a bath mat, certain that they have attained complete invisibility.

"New Legacy Of Kain Game Revealed, And It’s Out Next Month","<p dir=""ltr"">It might have taken 22 years, but at long last, a <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-is-back-with-two-new-games/1100-6538050/"">brand-new Legacy of Kain game</a> has been announced. Developed by BitBot Media, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-is-back-with-two-new-games/1100-6538050/"">Legacy of Kain: Ascendance is a pixel-art platformer</a> with plenty of action at its core, and it'll launch for PC and console on March 31.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Set before and during the events of Soul Reaver, Ascendance explores an era of the Legacy of Kain games that has only been briefly referenced--and before time-travel shenanigans started to make things a little confusing. Kain is in the middle of his campaign to conquer Nosgoth, while Raziel appears as a human Seraphan who fights back against the vampire clans.</p><p dir=""ltr"">A third character--Elaleth from the recent Legacy of Kain: Dead Shall Rise comic book mini-series--is also playable, and she's described as a fast-paced brawler who is adept at both combat and platforming. Crystal Dynamics and BitBot estimate that it will take roughly four hours to complete this retro-inspired platformer.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-legacy-of-kain-game-revealed-and-its-out-next-month/1100-6538136/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-13T12:32:06.382083

Oddly enough, while both Dead Cells and The Rogue Prince of Persia are roguelite games (good ones, too!), it doesn't seem like Belmont's Curse is.

The new title is the first 2D action platformer in the long-running God of War franchise. The story explores Kratos' early years during his brutal training in the Agoge. Players will follow a young Kratos as he trains alongside his brother Deimos, learning the harsh lessons that shape his future--and it's available to play now.</p><p>The game's story comes from the team at Santa Monica Studio, known for God of War (2018) and God of War Ragnarok. Original Kratos voice actor TC Carson returns to voice the adult Kratos for the first time in over a decade, serving as the game's narrator.

However, Silent Hill: Townfall is adding its own spin and sending the franchise into first-person survival horror.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py3_sAx3l_o"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Py3_sAx3l_o"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Silent Hill: Townfall was <a href=""https://screenburn.com/development-updates/2022/10/20/announcing-silent-hill-townfall"">previously announced in 2022</a> and is being developed by a studio called Screen Burn. The new protagonist's name is Simon Ordell, and he's found himself in the seaside town of St. Amelia. Although the place seems to be eerily deserted, Simon won't be by himself for long. As with other Silent Hill games, Simon's personal demons are given physical form here, and he'll have to defeat them to survive.</p><p>The biggest shift for this title is the first-person gameplay, as well as the handheld portable TV that Simon uses to detect the monsters in St. Amelia. It's an updated version of the radio that previous Silent Hill games have used for the same function. It's not quite as functional as Solid Snake's Codec Radar in the Metal Gear Solid games, but the TV can be used to help Simon hide from the monsters instead of facing them head on.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-townfall-shifts-first-person-survival-horror-to-new-town/1100-6538165/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-13T12:32:06.382083

"Beast Of Reincarnation Creator Says ""Every Single Thing"" About Making It ""Has Been A Challenge""","<p>Since its reveal at last summer's <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/"">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, Game Freak's newest venture, Beast of Reincarnation, has sparked both excitement and curiosity in equal measure. For the past few decades, Game Freak has firmly established its identity as the studio behind the Pokemon series; as such, the realistic-looking action-RPG marks a notable shift from the cartoonish creature-collection series.</p><p dir=""ltr"">In Beast of Reincarnation, players take on the role of Emma, a Purifier tasked with putting a stop to an ever-encroaching and life-threatening blight. Though this is no small task, she's not alone; alongside Emma is her wolf-life companion, Koo, who aids her on her journey through an overgrown, post-apocalyptic Japan. In the game's latest trailer, we saw a bit more about what exploration and combat will look like, and while you'll still be issuing commands to a furry friend, the action-packed RPG is a far cry from what we've come to expect from Game Freak.</p><p dir=""ltr"">So, why the dramatic departure from the studio's tried-and-true visual stylings and formula? That's just one of the questions GameSpot got the chance to ask Beast of Reincarnation's director, Kota Furushima. Ahead of the game's August 4 release date, we spoke with Furushima about the challenges he's experienced during production, what the game's core message is, and why--despite the company's long-standing relationship with Nintendo--Beast of Reincarnation is still not confirmed for Switch.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beast-of-reincarnation-creator-says-every-single-thing-about-making-it-has-been-a-challenge/1100-6538157/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-13T12:32:06.382083

Legacy Of Kain: Defiance Rises Again With New Remaster,"<p dir=""ltr"">The Legacy of Kain series is rising from its slumber once again, as today's State of Play revealed not one but <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-is-back-with-two-new-games/1100-6538050/"">two projects</a> that will see players return to Nosgoth. Fans of the classic games can look forward to a remaster of Legacy of Kain: Defiance when it launches on March 3 for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Released back in 2003, Defiance was the third chapter in the Soul Reaver saga. The big twist here was that Raziel and Kain were both playable characters, allowing players to step into the boots of the vampire lord and his former lieutenant. Crystal Dynamics has been working on the Defiance remaster for several years alongside PlayEveryWare, a team with credits on several video game ports.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Similar to <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-12-remastered-review-my-wayward-son-returns/1900-6418324/"">Soul Reaver 1&amp;2 Remastered</a>, you can expect upgraded visuals and cinematics, remastered audio, and several gameplay changes. The combat tutorial is now an independent feature, a new photo mode has been added, and the game's fixed camera has been replaced with a new free-floating camera system. Players can also switch to the original camera angles for an old-school experience, and the canonical map of Nosgoth introduced in the previous Soul Reaver remasters is back. It has also been enhanced with a new feature, Foresight Navigation, which essentially lets players better track their objectives on the map.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-defiance-rises-again-with-new-remaster/1100-6538135/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-13T12:32:06.382083

The Archer can fight with a spear (yari) and carry an extra ranged weapon. The Mercenary uses dual katanas and utility-focused skills. The Shinobi fights with a kusarigama and focuses on stealth abilities.

4 Loop Has A Giant Rubik's Cube Boss And Alien Berries That Teleport Enemies,"<p>4 Loop, the co-op shooter from Left 4 Dead designer Mike Booth and JJ Abrams' studio Bad Robot Games, has a roguelike structure, along with lots of wacky, interlocking systems like alien plant life and and a Rubik's Cube boss--and we got a new look at all of it. </p><p>PlayStation's <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-7488/"">State of Play for February 2026</a> showed off more of what to expect from <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-game-from-left-4-dead-designer-gives-off-edge-of-tomorrow-vibes/1100-6536907/"">the recently announced game</a>. The basic premise is this: Up to four players team up as part of a team fighting off a devastating alien invasion. The players will start each run of 4 Loop by voting for nodes on the Probability Map (think the map from Slay the Spire) which will determine the mission undertaken. Each mission is randomly generated. Players will tackle different objectives like rescuing survivors, collecting new resources, or hacking into alien computers. As long as just one player survives the mission, all four players will 3D-print back at base and be ready to take on the next challenge. Once the whole team is safe, they can select new weapons for their loadout and pick up upgrades.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoXXNPgqYkw"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hoXXNPgqYkw"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Each section of the probability map ends in a boss, a mission unto itself with a massive alien enemy. The gameplay trailer shown at the State of Play showed a gigantic Rubik's Cube-style robot with rotating sides. The Scanner boss scans the environment with laser grids that players will have to avoid. Players will have to fire at the boss from multiple sides to hit weak points, as the boss will turn its segmented parts. Players can also encounter tools out in the world, like berries that, when thrown, teleport items in the area to a far-away place on the map.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/4-loop-has-a-giant-rubiks-cube-boss-and-alien-berries-that-teleport-enemies/1100-6538158/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-13T12:32:06.382083

Assassin's Creed Is Doing Better Than Expected,"<p>Business at Ubisoft continues to grow in some areas, as <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-unions-call-on-workers-strike-in-february-enough-is-enough/1100-6537727/"">employees protest</a> layoffs and game cancellations. A newly released Ubisoft earning report states that Q3's ""overperformance versus expectations was primarily driven by partnerships and the Assassin’s Creed franchise."" Net bookings for Q3 stood at €338 million (approximately $401 million), which is 12% higher than the same quarter in last fiscal year.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Most of the quarter's income (€297m) came from Ubisoft's back catalog. In particular, Assassin's Creed as a franchise had 28% more total players than the same time last year, thanks in part to <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-mirage-free-dlc-takes-players-into-the-valley-of-memory/1100-6535272/"">free DLC for Assassin's Creed: Mirage</a> and the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-and-really-soon/1100-6535663/"">Switch 2 release of Assassin's Creed: Shadows</a>. The report also names The Division 2 and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora as games that saw significant growth in Q3--in the case of Avatar, it likely saw an influx of players as hype picked up for the latest Avatar film. Overall, 130 million unique players booted up Ubisoft games during the quarter, which the report claims is evidence of ""the appeal and strength of the Group’s portfolio of franchises.""</p><p dir=""ltr"">In January, the publisher closed Ubisoft Halifax, fired 70 employees, and <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/1200-ubisoft-employees-go-on-strike/1100-6538101/"">canceled multiple in-development projects</a>. Ubisoft also fired <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-fires-dev-who-criticized-the-companys-return-to-work-mandate/1100-6537850/"">a 12-year veteran without stated cause</a>, though the termination was shortly after he criticized the company's ""return-to-work"" mandate. The earnings report outlined further plans to ""reshape [Ubisoft's] HQ into a leaner and focused organization"" via ""a voluntary departure plan."" In response to the layoffs, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/1200-ubisoft-employees-go-on-strike/1100-6538101/"">1,200 Ubisoft employees, primarily in France, have gone on a three-day strike</a>.</p>",2026-02-13T12:32:06.382083

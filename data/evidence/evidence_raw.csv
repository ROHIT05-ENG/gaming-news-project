"Amid Fan Concerns About Metroid Prime 4's Sales, Nintendo Provides Some Clarity","<p>Nintendo's most recent earnings report delivered a routine update to its list of games that have sold at least one million copies by the end of 2025.

"Overwatch Kills Its First Character, But That Won't Stop You From Playing As Them","<p dir=""ltr"">As <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/"">Overwatch 2</a> continues to evolve--even <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/goodbye-overwatch-2-hello-overwatch-the-story-driven-forever-game-blizzard-promised-is-finally-here/1100-6537927/"">dropping the ""2"" entirely and just going as ""Overwatch""</a> from here on out--there's the question of what happens to its characters. Going forward, Overwatch plans on putting story first and foremost, and a big part of heroic fantasy is the conflicts between good and evil and how those conflicts lead to losses or setbacks on both sides. And while storylines like that may be in Overwatch's future, these developments won't ever reflect in the playable roster.</p><p dir=""ltr"">""There [are] no plans to remove any characters from the roster depending on what may happen to them,"" associate game director Alec Dawson told GameSpot. ""But, I think, one thing that's really important to us is to be in lockstep with what's going on with the story throughout the year, whether it be our maps, whether it be events going on, whether it be our heroes, to make sure that they are reflected in what's happening there too.""</p><p dir=""ltr"">This sounds in line with what we've seen in other hero shooters that have stories going on in the background of the matches--<a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/"">Rainbow Six Siege</a> has gone through several large shifts, for example, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-rainbow-six-siege-moved-away-from-its-counter-terrorism-narrative/1100-6495532/"">moving away from its counter-terrorism narrative</a> in February 2019 to tell a military simulation sport fantasy, and then returning to the original counter-terrorism throughline several years later. The playable roster of the tactical shooter only grew during those developments, but the framing of matches and the types of new Operators, maps, and skins added in each season dramatically transformed to reflect a new narrative direction.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-kills-its-first-character-but-that-wont-stop-you-from-playing-as-them/1100-6537894/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-05T12:34:03.709441
"Overwatch Is Getting Five New Characters, Here's A First Look At What They Do","<p>Several <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/goodbye-overwatch-2-hello-overwatch-the-story-driven-forever-game-blizzard-promised-is-finally-here/1100-6537927/"">big changes are coming to Overwatch</a> in what is easily the game's most substantial update so far. On top of a name change, an unexpected pivot to a narrative-driven format, a seriously adorable collaboration, major UI updates, and more, five new characters are coming to Overwatch to help kick off The Reign of Talon, Season 1 on February 10. That's right: <em>Five</em>.</p><p>Fortunately, this new lineup includes a tank, two support characters, and two damage characters, meaning every player will get the chance to test out a new hero (or nefarious Talon agent) if they so choose. That said, even game director Aaron Keller told GameSpot this large influx of characters will inevitably lead to <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-director-says-upcoming-changes-will-upset-the-games-balance-theres-no-getting-around-that/1100-6537883/"">balance issues</a>--and that's without considering how overwhelming it can be to to play a new character you're unfamiliar with. With that in mind, here's a quick rundown of Overwatch's new characters--Emre, Domina, Mizuki, Anran, and Jetpack Cat--to help you familiarize yourself with them ahead of their debut.</p><h2>Emre - Damage</h2><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4645396-emre.png"" data-ref-id=""1300-4645396"" data-ratio=""0.5625"" data-width=""2560"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 2560px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4645396-emre.png""><img alt=""No Caption Provided"" src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4645396-emre.png"" srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4645396-emre.png 2560w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4645396-emre.png 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1639/16394322/4645396-emre.png 480w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"" data-width=""1280""></a></figure><p>Let's kick things off with the most beginner-friendly hero of the group, Emre. Those of you who are tuned into Overwatch have probably been expecting Emre, as this Overwatch-turned-Talon agent has been teased and alluded to for literal years. After playing a match as him last week, I'm happy to report that he was well-worth the wait.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-is-getting-five-new-characters-heres-a-first-look-at-what-they-do/1100-6537890/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-05T12:34:03.709441
"Yes, Overwatch Characters Have Been Getting Sexier, But Not For The Obvious Reason","<p dir=""ltr"">If you've noticed <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/"">Overwatch's</a> characters getting progressively sexier over the years, you're not alone, though Blizzard said there is an explanation for it aside from thirsty gamers.</p><p dir=""ltr"">When Overwatch first launched in 2016, part of its appeal was its wide-ranging roster of characters of all shapes and sizes, ranging from a talking gorilla to a robotic monk. Characters like Zarya and Mei broke the mold of what many players were accustomed to seeing from female characters.</p><p dir=""ltr"">In 2026, while there is still the occasional oddball character (like Venture or the upcoming <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-is-finally-getting-a-cat-hero-a-decade-after-inception/1100-6537875/"">Jetpack Cat</a>), many of Overwatch's newer heroes, like Freja, Vendetta, Wuyang, and Juno, as well as many of the new heroes coming in Overwatch 2026 Season 1, are all what society would label as more conventionally attractive. Usually, they are tall, skinny, and fit.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yes-overwatch-characters-have-been-getting-sexier-but-not-for-the-obvious-reason/1100-6537888/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-05T12:34:03.709441
"Overwatch Director Says Upcoming Changes Will Upset The Game's Balance: ""There's No Getting Around That""","<p>Overwatch 2, now <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-is-dropping-the-2-and-launching-a-new-story-driven-era/1100-6537874/"">renamed simply Overwatch</a>, is <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/goodbye-overwatch-2-hello-overwatch-the-story-driven-forever-game-blizzard-promised-is-finally-here/1100-6537927/"">undergoing some big changes</a>, with a new seasonal model focused on telling continuous year-long stories. As part of the soft relaunch, Blizzard is coming out strong with five new playable characters, substantially increasing the roster much more than usual at one time. That is bound to have an impact on the meta-game, and Blizzard is well aware.</p><p>""It's going to upset the balance of the game. There's no getting around that. There's something very exciting about it though,"" Blizzard's Aaron Keller told GameSpot. ""I think what we see with Overwatch is that our players do acclimate to change into new heroes fairly quickly. At the highest levels, it might just be a few days. They could have a handle on these new heroes that quickly and start developing metas for them.""</p><p>Those five new characters include one new Tank (Domina), two DPS (Emre, Anran), and two Support (Mizuki, Jetpack Cat). That reflects the team-comp requirements in Overwatch 2, which is a major way that it differentiated itself from the looser restrictions of the first game.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-director-says-upcoming-changes-will-upset-the-games-balance-theres-no-getting-around-that/1100-6537883/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-05T12:34:03.709441
Overwatch Is About To Reach Peak Cute With Sanrio Hello Kitty Collab,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/"">Overwatch</a> is about to get a whole lot cuter, as adorable skins based on Sanrio characters like Hello Kitty and Cinnamoroll will be the hero shooter's first collaboration for 2026.</p><p dir=""ltr"">The collab begins the same day as Overwatch 2026 Season 1 on February 10 and will last through the February 23. There are six skins in total, with many of the game's more popular female characters represented (plus Lucio). Despite <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-is-finally-getting-a-cat-hero-a-decade-after-inception/1100-6537875/"">Overwatch adding an actual cat hero</a>, they are sadly not receiving a collab skin. The six skins and heroes receiving them are:</p><ul><li dir=""ltr"">Juno: Hello Kitty</li><li dir=""ltr"">Kiriko: Cinnamoroll</li><li dir=""ltr"">Mercy: Pompompurin</li><li dir=""ltr"">D.Va: My Melody</li><li dir=""ltr"">Widowmaker: Kuromi</li><li dir=""ltr"">Lucio: Keroppi</li></ul><p dir=""ltr"">While some Overwatch collabs see the game's heroes literally transform into iconic characters from another IP, these are a little less extreme. Juno, for example, is not literally Hello Kitty, but is rather wearing a Hello Kitty-themed outfit. Each skin is more inspired by their respective Sanrio character rather than being an exact copy of them.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-is-about-to-reach-peak-cute-with-sanrio-hello-kitty-collab/1100-6537881/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-05T12:34:03.709441

Developer Gearbox has announced that Borderlands 4 is now Steam Deck Verified, which, according to Valve, means that the game will work on the handheld gaming PC without a user needing to fiddle with manual settings--but you still can, if you want.</p><p>Digging deeper, this means that Borderlands 4 meets several requirements from Valve to be Steam Deck Verified, including a default resolution of 1280 x 720 and full controller support. <a href=""https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified"">Valve doesn't </a><a href=""https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified"">list</a> performance as a factor beyond a brief mention of ""good"" default settings, but overall, Borderlands 4 should run similarly to its Windows counterpart.</p><p>It's worth noting that games that have received a Steam Deck Verified label can still run poorly on the handheld, with notable examples being Mortal Kombat 1 and God of War shortly after release. These games still run well most of the time, but they do suffer from performance issues.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/at-least-borderlands-4-works-on-this-handheld-console/1100-6537926/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-05T12:34:03.709441

The assault vehicle is capable of carrying up to four Helldivers, and the 120mm cannon packs a punch. Each seated player has a role to play--driver, gunner, and two passenger seats to cover the flanks--so teamwork is essential. Even if you run out of ammo, you can use it as a makeshift Automaton-flattening machine for as long as its thick armor holds up in battle.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_ZVYxDgbM0"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3_ZVYxDgbM0"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>There's also a <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-helldivers-2-warbond-adds-laser-shotguns-and-explosive-hammers-next-month/2900-7431/"">new Premium Warbond</a> to unlock weapons from this month, so a combination of laser-firing shotguns, sphere-shields, and explosive hammers will give Helldivers a fighting chance on the Automaton's home planet.

New Management Sim Lets You Climb The Corporate Ladder And Sell Your Soul,"<p>Do you have a disregard for people? Are you willing to use cutthroat tactics to climb the corporate ladder and temporarily satisfy shareholders by burning through employees? Then you might have what it takes to become a CEO--or at the very least--a winner in Manifesto. Developer Breakpoint Games describes it as a management sim that's all about ""burnout, layoffs, and making sh*tloads of money.""</p><p>Just like the real world of Big Business, Manifesto will challenge players to put aside their feelings and become the problem as they work to survive corporate culture. The game has a very on-the-nose feature: It revolves around hiring employees, working them to the bone, and then burning them out to make extra profit as you chase increasingly impossible sales targets. Fortunately, you can juice the numbers with unlockable power-ups and by making unethical decisions to keep the sales flowing.</p><div data-embed-type=""video""

"New Xenoblade Game Is On The Way, Voice Actor Seemingly Reveals","<p dir=""ltr"">The chances of an upcoming Xenoblade announcement just leveled up, thanks to a listing by the voice actor for <a href=""https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/KOS-MOS"">KOS-MOS</a> in <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/xenoblade-chronicles-2-review/1900-6416821/"">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a>. <a href=""https://english-voice-over.fandom.com/wiki/Caitlin_Thorburn"">Caitlin Thorburn</a> apparently updated her <a href=""https://www.spotlight.com/voice-over/"">Spotlight</a> page with a credit for a Xenoblade Chronicles game in 2026.</p><p dir=""ltr"">The <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qvb7f9/caitlin_thorburn_just_updated_her_spotlight_page/"">Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit</a> highlighted Thorburn's possible spoiler for a new Xenoblade game, which was first spotted by <a href=""https://famiboards.com/threads/monolith-soft-development-and-speculation-st.51/page-55"">Famiboards</a>. Thorburn's page notes her role as KOS-MOS once again for ""Xenoblade Chronicles."" This could mean Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is receiving a Definitive Edition--similar to <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-trailer-shows-off-the-remasters-switch-glow-up/1100-6528711/"">the Xenoblade Chronicles X remaster</a> that was released last year.

Considering it's been almost nine years since Xenoblade Chronicles 2 launched, it obviously wouldn't be new to see Nintendo and developer Monolith Soft revisiting the RPG.</p><p dir=""ltr"">However, Thorburn's listing is vague enough that it's possible a new entry for Xenoblade Chronicles is on the way--whether that's 4 or a sequel to X. There's always the possibility that it's for a crossover game like Xenoblade Warriors or just a mistake entirely by the voice actor, too.

"Fallout Series Countdown Doesn't Lead To Fallout 3 Remaster, Like Fans Hoped","<p>The second season of Amazon's Fallout series concluded yesterday, and with it the mystery behind the countdown timer on the show's official website. And as you might expect, it's not led to anything as exciting as some were hoping for.</p><p>There was strong speculation online that the countdown would end with the announcement (and in some more hopeful corners, the release) of remasters for either <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-3/"">Fallout 3 </a>or <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-new-vegas/"">Fallout: New Vegas</a>, neither of which transpired yesterday evening. Instead, fans of both the games and show were treated to recreation of one of New Vegas' most iconic locations: the <a href=""https://fallout-s2.amazonstudios.com/"">Lucky 38 casino penthouse</a>, home to Robert House, before the bombs dropped.</p><p>Like other markers on the map on the official site, this is a simple but interesting interactive look at some of the popular locations from the show, with Vault 33 and Caswennan featuring previously. It's not clear why this location in particular warranted a countdown for several weeks, especially since it's a location that debuted in the show several episodes ago already.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-series-countdown-doesnt-lead-to-fallout-3-remaster-like-fans-hoped/1100-6537923/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-05T12:34:03.709441

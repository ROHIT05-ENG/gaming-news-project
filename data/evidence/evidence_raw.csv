Cats are often delightful reprobates and oddballs. They're needlessly, inventively cruel, or inhumanly calm and forbearing, or they're ostentatiously silly. One will sit on the landing and swipe at everyone. Another will hide under a bath mat, certain that they have attained complete invisibility.

Nioh 3 review,"<img src=""https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/nioh-3-gameplay-screen-4.jpg?width=690&quality=85&format=jpg&auto=webp"" /> <p>The Nioh series isn't exactly known for its nuance: there is good and evil, strong and weak, and little in-between. From feuding clans to the machinations of political elites, this binary is at the heart of everything in Team Ninja's pseudo-historical canon. <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nioh-3"">Nioh 3</a> takes this black-and-white worldview and applies it to the feuding Tokugawa brothers at the start of the Seventeenth Century. Your character, Takechiyo, is good: noble, just, <em>proper</em>. Your brother, a bitter little rat tempted by ancient powers beyond his understanding (of course), is evil. His desire for power and notoriety is so distinct, in fact, that it has somehow summoned a supernatural 'crucible' from the darkest reaches of space-time, and this consuming chaos is so profound, it has managed to seep into four major eras of Japanese history.

Discovery, Paramount continues to pursue a buyout of the company and has now sweetened its bid for the entertainment giant in an attempt to convince WBD shareholders to drop Netflix and go with Paramount instead.</p><p>Paramount's revised offer,<a href=""https://ir.paramount.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paramount-enhances-its-superior-30-share-all-cash-offer-warner""> announced on February 10</a>, includes a $0.25 per share ""ticking fee,"" payable to WBD shareholders for each quarter during the deal process that the buyout is not closed after December 31, 2026.

Unravel Is Still Leaving An Impact A Decade After Launch,"<p dir=""ltr""><em>Unravel celebrated its 10-year anniversary on February 9, 2025. Below, we look back on the tiny passion project and speak with a developer about how it came together.</em></p><p dir=""ltr"">During EA's E3 2015 press conference, Coldwood Studios' Martin Sahlin came out on stage and <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unravel-is-e3-2015-s-most-adorable-game/1100-6428137/"">revealed a cute platformer called Unravel</a>. As he revealed Yarny's handcrafted origins and spoke about the heart and passion Coldwood had in creating this new experience, you could hear and see him growing more emotional. It wasn't an E3 flub, but a reminder that the industry is at its best when developers have space to make games they love.</p><p dir=""ltr""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/unravel-review/1900-6416352/"">Unravel</a> turned 10 years old on February 9. I still remember the game's impassioned reveal and how I had such a wonderful time playing. Revisiting Unravel at its surprisingly distinct sequel ahead of this anniversary, I was taken aback by how refreshing these yarn-filled adventures were. I was even more excited to learn that some of the team is reuniting to work on a new game launching later this year.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unravel-is-still-leaving-an-impact-a-decade-after-launch/1100-6538072/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-11T01:15:02.337613
Firewatch Helped Pioneer A Genre That Burned Brightly But Briefly,"<p dir=""ltr""><em>Firewatch celebrated its 10-year anniversary on February 9, 2025. Below, we examine the origins of the so-called ""walking simulator"" and why the fire appears to have died out.</em></p><p dir=""ltr"">When Firewatch launched on February 9th, 2016, it was easy to relate to the game's leads, Henry and Delilah. These characters spent a summer staring down as fire spread, slowly filling the forest around their watchtowers with smoke. Observers of the ""walking sim"" genre saw a similar blaze burn across the decade. It began with Dear Esther, sparked to scorching flame with the friction of Gone Home's release, and became a towering creative inferno with modern classics like Firewatch and What Remains of Edith Finch. As the 2010s came to a close, fans expected the fire to continue raging through the '20s.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Instead, it burned out. A decade after Campo Santo released this deeply human game about paranoia in a national park, walking sims have fallen from mainstream prominence. It's not that no one is making them anymore--there are tiny indies available on platforms like <a href=""http://itch.io"">itch.io</a>. But the teams that made the defining games have spun their wheels, sold their studios, or split. And The Game Awards nominations have dried up, too. Despelote is the only game in the genre to receive recognition this decade with two nods, compared to five for Firewatch, three noms and one win for Edith Finch, a Games for Impact nod for Sunset, and a Best Independent Game nomination for The Vanishing of Ethan Carter--all in a three-year span. In the 2010s, every year or two saw the release of an iconic, widely discussed entry, but we're six years into the 2020s and still waiting.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/firewatch-helped-pioneer-a-genre-that-burned-brightly-but-briefly/1100-6538071/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-11T01:15:02.337613

Fortnite Ramps Up Anti-Cheat Efforts With New Requirements For PC Tourneys,"<p>Epic Games is adding a new anti-cheat requirement for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/"">Fortnite</a> tournaments for PC players, though it's not something most folks are going to have to worry about. Starting February 19, those who want to play in Fortnite tournaments on PC will have to have IOMMU protection (input-output memory management) enabled, in addition to the previously required SecureBoot and TPM. The good news is that most everyone playing on Windows 11 will already have this enabled, since it's typically enabled by default on compatible motherboards.</p><p>IOMMU, like TPM, is another method to protect against cheaters using hardware cheats, while the Easy Anti-Cheat application handles the software side of things. Note that this new requirement is just for tournaments. IOMMU is not required if you're just playing casual or ranked Battle Royale with your friends. If you try to play a tournament while IOMMU is off, you won't be banned--the game simply won't let you play. <a href=""https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/fortnite-battle-royale-c-202300000001636/technical-support-c-202300000001719/iommu-is-required-to-play-error-when-logging-into-fortnite-on-pc-a202300000080160"">Learn about how to enable IOMMU here</a>.</p><p>The topic of cheating in Fortnite has been a common one since Epic <a href=""https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-anti-cheat-update-february-27-2025?lang=en-US"">unbanned past cheaters</a> a year ago to give them a second chance--since then, players on social media often baselessly claim the move has led to a cheating epidemic. Meanwhile, Epic has been taking legal action against <a href=""https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1944788275711054250"">cheaters</a> and forcing them to <a href=""https://x.com/FNCompetitive/status/1981389949602836992"">apologize</a> publicly several times over the past year.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-ramps-up-anti-cheat-efforts-with-new-requirements-for-pc-tourneys/1100-6538067/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-11T01:15:02.337613

The new <strong>Herald</strong> keyword is used by Deathwing-aligned cards and has stacking effects the more you play.

Why Resident Evil’s Most Painfully Awkward Hero Is Actually Its Best,"<p dir=""ltr"">If there’s one thing Resident Evil is known for, outside of zombies, it’s action heroes with impeccable hair and impressive catalogs of one-liners. Who could ever forget fending off hordes of crazed villagers in Resident Evil 4, only to have Leon say, “Where’s everyone going, bingo?” There’s an edge of “cool” that has become integral to Resident Evil over the decades, but after the debacle of Resident Evil 6, Capcom knew it had to do something different.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Ethan Winters is not cool. He’s more the absence of cool than anything--a dad joke dressed up as an action hero. But perhaps what’s most amazing is how all that invariably turns him into one of the most compelling protagonists of the series’ history. Ethan is likable in spite of himself, and a surprisingly meaningful piece of the puzzle in how Resident Evil 7 and Village redefined the franchise’s tone while still keeping its heart alive. Sometimes, horror games don’t need an action hero; they just need a dude.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Ethan isn’t a highly trained specialist, he’s not a member of an anti-terrorist organization, or even a cop--he’s a systems engineer. Oh, you didn’t know he’s a systems engineer? That’s because the game itself never tells you that. Perhaps the most apt way to define Ethan Winters is as Resident Evil’s “wife guy.” What I mean by that is that Ethan’s entire identity is tied to his relationships, along with the driving force behind all of his actions. For all intents and purposes, Ethan really is just some guy--a milquetoast middle-of-the-road average dude who just happened to fall in love with and marry a woman who worked on horrific bioweapons. But in a world where zombie apocalypses happen every few years, maybe that’s not so weird. Mia is the one wrapped up in the ongoing soap opera about freakish creatures; Ethan’s just along for the ride.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-resident-evils-most-painfully-awkward-hero-is-actually-its-best/1100-6538051/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-11T01:15:02.337613
This Tactics Game Takes The Baldur's Gate 3 Approach To Tabletop RPG Adaptation,"<p>There are two ways developers can go with a tabletop-game-to-video-game adaptation.

Players are cast as Gravebound, lost souls whose debt to the Taxman extends beyond the grave. To escape their crushing obligations, they are forced to enter cursed tombs in an attempt to survive long enough to escape with any loot they can carry. But some treasures require two hands to handle, and that's going to make it hard to evade the angry spirits you've unleashed by stealing from them.</p><p>Begraved's tombs are procedurally generated areas with support for five-player co-op and proximity voice chat. The current build of the game supports both solo and co-opt playthroughs in two complete zones, with upgrades and hideouts already incorporated into the game. The eventual 1.0 release will include two additional zones, as well as new enemies, relics, and afflictions.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-game-from-valheim-devs-begraved-now-has-a-demo/1100-6538057/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-11T01:15:02.337613

How To Become Ruler In The Sims 4: Royalty And Legacy,"<p>The newest expansion for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/"">The Sims 4</a>, Royalty and Legacy, introduces some major new wrinkles to the way this digital world works. The main one is that your Sims can now become ruler of the city they live in and start a dynasty that can solidify the family's power for generations.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Since the Royalty and Legacy expansion is fueled by pretty much entirely new mechanics, it's not actually that obvious how to get started on the road to power. But that's what we're here for.</p><div data-embed-type=""toc""><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a href=""https://www.gamespot.com"">hide</a>]</span><ul id=""toc_list"" class=""collapse in""><li><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com"">It's all about the nobles</a></li></ul></div><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4651480-ts4_ep21_official_screens_03_003_16x9.jpg"" data-ref-id=""1300-4651480"" data-ratio=""0.5625"" data-width=""1920"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 1920px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4651480-ts4_ep21_official_screens_03_003_16x9.jpg""><img alt=""No Caption Provided"" src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4651480-ts4_ep21_official_screens_03_003_16x9.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4651480-ts4_ep21_official_screens_03_003_16x9.jpg 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4651480-ts4_ep21_official_screens_03_003_16x9.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1757/17577455/4651480-ts4_ep21_official_screens_03_003_16x9.jpg 480w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"" data-width=""1280""></a></figure><h2 dir=""ltr"" id=""It_s_all_about_the_nobles"">It's all about the nobles</h2><p dir=""ltr"">A Sim who wants to rule must be a noble, and unless your Sim is literally a dynasty's heir to the throne, that means partaking in the Noble career. Being a professional noble is very different from any other career in The Sims 4, because it's a 24/7 gig. Everything your Sim does can hypothetically affect their status. And this career isn't one you can join with a phone call. To start things off, you'll need to one of three options: request a knighthood from a noble who likes your Sim; choose the Research Nobility option on the book The Duchess Diaries: A History of Nobility, which is stocked on every bookshelf; or buy a throne in build mode and simply declare your Sim a noble.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-become-ruler-in-the-sims-4-royalty-and-legacy/1100-6538194/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-16T01:07:30.071979

The game features a retro, pixelated art style that only adds to its creepy vibes. It alone typically retails for $15--making the Love You To Death Bundle a much better deal than buying the game by itself.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/humble-love-you-to-death-bundle/1100-6538134/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-16T01:07:30.071979

"Blizzard President Looks To The Future And Admits ""Not Everything's Going To Hit""","<p>This year marks the 35th anniversary of Blizzard, and the company already has reason <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-hits-highest-steam-concurrent-player-peak-since-release-day/1100-6538020/"">to celebrate the recent Overwatch rebrand</a> that's revitalized the hero shooter. Blizzard President Johanna Faries is very optimistic about the company's future, but she's also fully aware that not every swing at the plate will work out in its favor.</p><p>""We've set a lot in motion with respect to [the future of Blizzard], making sure we're clear on it, making sure we’re coordinated on it,"" said Faries during an appearance on the <a href=""https://youtu.be/A3SDlnpT5V4"">Official Xbox Podcast</a>. ""There's sort of a reliability that players can depend on us to launch in big ways, launch in surprising ways. Maybe take some zags! Not everything's going to hit. That's gaming. But in many ways, let's understand where we are going--not only as a company, but by franchise, by game.""</p><p>Faries may be referring to some Blizzard games that were in development but never saw the light of day.

Death Stranding 2 Concept Art Reveals Sam’s Lost Turtleneck Phase,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/"">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> isn't exactly subtle in its themes, as the story is clearly influenced by COVID, lockdowns, and travel restrictions in place during the early years of the coronavirus outbreak. Originally, game director Hideo Kojima had an entirely different story in mind, but after the COVID pandemic began in 2020, he began to rethink his approach to the topic of connection. So what did Death Stranding 2 originally look like? For starters, it would have involved a lot more high-end fashion for its protagonist, Sam Porter Bridges, and his allies.</p><p><a href=""https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2022205133405446574"">Kojima recently posted images online</a> from the upcoming <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-art-book-goes-behinds-the-scenes-on-death-stranding-2-on-the-beachs-development/1100-6532664/"">Death Stranding 2 art book</a>, showing off a ""pre-COVID"" look at Bridges and Fragile.

Steam Reviews Will Now Let You Share What Hardware You Used To Run Games,"<p>Valve has started testing a new feature that will allow users to add hardware specifications to user reviews, giving you more information when attempting to determine how a game might run on your own PC.</p><p>The <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/505101717860253962"">update</a>, which is currently being deployed to the Steam Beta Client, will give users the ability to attach hardware information to user reviews instead of just relying on users entering this in the text directly. The patch notes don't mention how or if these specifications will be verified by Steam, or whether the information is going to be sourced from Steam's optional Hardware Survey database.</p><p>Either way, it should give reviews more context when users leave criticism over a game's performance, letting you make a decision over whether it might affect your current hardware configuration. In addition to this, Valve is also giving users the option to allow for anonymized framerate data collection. This is currently exclusive to devices using SteamOS (which is officially just handhelds currently) but will apparently be used to help Valve determine game performance and compatibility to improve Steam going forward.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-reviews-will-now-let-you-share-what-hardware-you-used-to-run-games/1100-6538178/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-16T01:07:30.071979
One Of The Biggest Gaming Buyouts In History Is Reportedly Underway,"<p>A new report claims that TikTok owner ByteDance is in ""advanced talks"" to sell its subsidiary Moonton Technology to Saudi Arabia's Savvy Games Group.

How Long To Beat High On Life 2,"<p>If you're a fan of wacky--and frequently vulgar--comedy games, you'll probably be interested in seeing what <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/high-on-life-2/"">High on Life 2</a> has to offer. This raunchy, action-packed sequel packs in even more fart jokes, F-bombs, and grotesque creatures than the first outing, ensuring that you're always either laughing or holding back your lunch--or both at the same time. But if you're curious about diving in guns blazing for a second romp through this universe, you may want to know how long it'll take you to see it through. So, here's how long it takes to beat High on Life 2.</p><h2>How long is High on Life 2?</h2><p>High on Life 2 is faster-paced than the original, but it also provides larger, more open zones to explore and some surprisingly thoughtful puzzles you'll need to complete on your journey toward its conclusion. It's rarely overwhelmingly difficult, though, so if your goal is just to reach the end of the game and see the credits roll, then <strong>an average playthrough should take 10-12 hours</strong>. Still, for those who want more, there's a lot of optional stuff to see and do as you explore each area.</p><p>If you do decide to take on the additional content scattered throughout the world of High on Life 2, you can extend your total playtime by a few hours. Heading out to explore each of the game's main hubs during your downtime between missions can yield extra money (pesos) and useful upgrades. And if you're a true completionist looking to fill out the full trophy or achievement list, you'll find things like skateboard races, retro games to discover, and additional one-off tasks to complete on your quest to see absolutely everything in the game.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-long-to-beat-high-on-life-2/1100-6538074/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-16T01:07:30.071979
Reanimal Secret Bunker Guide - How To Find And Input The Secret Code,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/reanimal/"">Reanimal</a> may seem to be all about the jump scares and creepy imagery--and it largely is--but it also features a handful of fun secrets that can earn you in-game collectibles, as well as get you closer to obtaining 100% completion. In the case of the ""Secret Bunker"" trophy or achievement, you'll need to round up a secret code and input it into a machine somewhere on your adventure. But since the secret code is potentially the most easily overlooked thing in the entire game, we'll fill you in on where to find it, as well as where you'll need to enter it to complete this little side objective.</p><h2>Where to find the secret code in Reanimal</h2><p>You can find Reanimal's secret code in <strong>Chapter 1: Dead in the Water</strong>. However, note that <strong>the secret code is the same in every game, so if you've already passed this chapter and just want the answer, go ahead and skip to the next section for the location and solution</strong>.</p><p>When you arrive at the handcar for the first time, you'll need to find and attach some wheels before it can be used. Before doing any of that, enter the bottom right door in this area.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/reanimal-secret-bunker-guide-how-to-find-and-input-the-secret-code/1100-6538035/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-16T01:07:30.071979

How Long To Beat Reanimal,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/reanimal/"">Reanimal</a> is a spiritual successor to developer Tarsier Studios' acclaimed horror franchise Little Nightmares, taking that series' disturbing imagery and sinister creature design to even darker levels than ever before. Playable solo or co-op (via split-screen or online), this nightmarish entry in the team's catalog doesn't hold back on the tension one bit, making it a potentially worthy grab for horror enthusiasts. Still, you may want to know what to expect from the game's length before diving in. If you're curious about how long it'll take to beat Reanimal, we've got everything you need to know below.</p><h2>How long to beat Reanimal</h2><p>Reanimal is a relatively brief experience that should take the average player <strong>around 5 or 6 hours</strong> to complete. Most chapters are linear with a clear path forward, and the puzzles that stand between you and the next room tend to be less brain teasers and more progression blockers designed to make you work together with your co-op partner (or AI companion if you're solo). The game's more challenging aspects include some occasional trial-and-error stealth and chase sequences--but they aren't anything too severe, either.</p><p>However, those looking to get the most out of Reanimal will find a lot of collectibles in nooks and crannies around its dark and unsettling environments, including posters, secret statues, and equippable masks. There are even extremely well-hidden coffins in secret places throughout the adventure, which will unlock a secret ending once they're all found. <strong>Taking the time to thoroughly search every section of the game can add a few more hours to your total playtime</strong>, maybe even pushing things <strong>past 10 hours</strong> if you get particularly stuck on the hunt for a particular collectible.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-long-to-beat-reanimal/1100-6537739/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-16T01:07:30.071979

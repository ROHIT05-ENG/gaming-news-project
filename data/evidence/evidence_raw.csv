"Nex Playground Boss Says The Console Solves The Wii ""Problem""","<p>While Sony and Nintendo have expanded their lead over Xbox, a dark horse console had <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kinects-revenge-nex-playground-outsells-xbox-hardware-in-the-us/1100-6537053/"">a very strong showing</a> in third place in November. The Nex Playground has emerged as a breakout hit, and CEO David Lee believes that one of the reasons why its been so successful is because the console has solved the Wii ""problem.""</p><p>Nearly two decades ago, the Wii powered Nintendo's post-GameCube comeback with its motion controls and unique games. Lee argues that the scope of Wii's success made it difficult to sustain in the long term. Instead of trying to sell games like Wii, Nex Playground is offering its titles as part of a subscription service.</p><p>""One of the most important things we should do is learn from history and try not to commit the same limitations, and that's why we have a subscription model,"" Lee told <a href=""https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-want-a-nex-playground-in-every"">The Game Business</a>. ""Nintendo expanded the audience with Wii. When you expand the audience, and they want different things, and they only buy Wii Fit, Wii Sports and not many others … that's a bit of a problem.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nex-playground-boss-says-the-console-solves-the-wii-problem/1100-6537124/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-20T13:18:21.954530

The 1988 movie raised the bar for film animation and is widely credited with introducing mainstream audiences outside Japan to the medium. However, the anime adaptation is only part of the tale. Like innumerable other anime projects, Akira is adapted from a much longer--though lesser-known--manga series.

Taking place in the post-apocalyptic city of Neo-Tokyo, the series examines the after-effects of a mysterious explosion that almost destroyed the city. Thirty years later, teenage biker gang leader Shotaro Kaneda finds himself in the middle of a plot that involves militant revolutionaries, psychically gifted individuals, military forces, and his childhood friend, Tetsuo Shima, who has begun to develop dangerously destructive psychic powers of his own. Akira manga was critically acclaimed for its mature themes, well-developed characters, intriguing storylines, and Otomo's artwork. In the years since its publication, it's become regarded as one of the pioneering works in the then-burgeoning Cyberpunk sci-fi subgenre.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/akira-hardcover-manga-deals/1100-6537101/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-20T13:18:21.954530

He's also moving fast because Pauline's legs are dangling in the air. The uneven ground beneath DK's feet aligns with rocky terrain found in Ingot Isle, Lagoon Layer, and other locales from the game.</p><p>As for its functionality in the game, scanning the Donkey Kong and Pauline Amiibo grants two main perks. You can unlock Pauline's Diva Dress a lot earlier in your adventure with the Amiibo. The Diva Dress doubles the likelihood of enemies dropping music discs.

Nintendo Might Change The Switch 2 Feature Players Complain About Most,"<p>A sizeable portion of Nintendo Switch 2 players have been very vocal about their opposition to Game-Key Cards that allow players to digitally download a game rather than including it on a cartridge. But there's at least one publisher that's taken this criticism to heart by switching gears from This may be a welcome development for Nintendo Switch 2 players who hate Game-Key Cards back to cartridges, thanks to the new size options offered by Nintendo.</p><p>Inin Games shared the news that its <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-game-ditches-game-key-cards-for-a-physical-release-but-itll-cost-more/1100-6537110/"">upcoming US and European run</a> of <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/r-type-dimensions-iii/"">R-Type Dimensions III</a> is going to be released on a physical cartridge instead of a Game-Key Cards. The company also cited a recalculation of the <a href=""https://iningames.com/blogs/news/update-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-physical-release-of-r-type-dimensions-iii"">production prices</a> as a reason for the change. Apparently it's cheaper to release a game on Game-Key Cards, but the rumored measures taken by Nintendo apparently lowered the price for cartridges as well.</p><p>Game-Key Cards have been in physical Nintendo Switch 2 game boxes, but those cards don't actually include any game data. Instead, the Game-Key Cards allow the console to download the game from the internet. </p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-might-change-the-switch-2-feature-players-complain-about-most/1100-6537120/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-20T13:18:21.954530

Bethesda's space-based game will <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-getting-a-second-story-dlc-and-more/1100-6534318/"">receive an additional story DLC</a>, it's just a matter of when. Now, a new report suggests that the delay of <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/"">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> played a role in Bethesda's decision to push back its next Starfield chapter.</p><p>According to <a href=""https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/is-xboxs-starfield-going-to-get-its-cyberpunk-2-0-moment-rumors-swirl-around-a-secret-event-and-a-ps5-launch"">Windows Central</a>, Bethesda ""felt more comfortable"" about pushing Starfield's second DLC to the first half of 2026 because Microsoft already had a ""busy holiday period"" for 2025 without it. More intriguingly, the same report indicates that Bethesda has already been showing off the new update and DLC behind closed doors to a select group of players.</p><p>One of the rumored changes is a revamp of the game's space flight systems that will actually make travel feel like a journey instead of a series of loading screens. Other aspects of space travel and exploration are also said to be improved in the new update, and the Creation Engine will reportedly include ""large technical improvements ... that will also carry forward to future games.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-second-dlc-reportedly-pushed-back-because-of-gta-6-delay/1100-6537116/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-20T13:18:21.954530
"Witcher 4 Dev Is Says AI Can Unlock ""Meaningful"" Benefits","<p>The Witcher and Cyberpunk developer CD Projekt Red is the latest company to sound off on the use of AI in gaming. During CD Projekt Red's latest earnings briefing, Joint CEO Michał Nowakowski said<span> there are ""meaningful"" and ""real"" benefits to using the technology.</span></p><p>The company is already implementing such technologies ""mainly in the productivity areas"" and so far that's where the ""largest benefits"" have stemmed from, he <a href=""https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/result-center/"">explained</a>, <a href=""https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/the-witcher-4-and-cyberpunk-2-boss-is-skeptical-ai-can-replace-industry-talent-and-cant-imagine-reducing-headcount-thanks-to-the-tech-its-not-gonna-be-making-the-witcher-5/"">as reported by GamesRadar.</a> A developer won't be able to use AI to make an entire game, though, and humans will remain essential to the process, he said.</p><p>""The benefits are real, they’re meaningful; but it's not a situation--and I'm unaware of such a situation--where AI could 'sit down and make games.' That's our take. It doesn't mean it's not gonna be useful, but it's not gonna be making The Witcher 5, or 6, or anything like that,"" Nowakowski explained.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-is-says-ai-can-unlock-meaningful-benefits/1100-6537119/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-20T13:18:21.954530

Four machines can be linked via your local network for competitive play, and there’s an online leaderboard for you to track your performance. The cabinet stands over 64 inches tall and weighs nearly 70lbs. It sports a 17-inch LCD display, integrated speakers, and colorful artwork from the game. The control panel features a steering wheel rather than a set of buttons. At the bottom of the cabinet are gas and brake pedals and a molded faux coin door.</p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/ARCADE1UP-Furious-5-Foot-Tall-Stand-up-Cabinet/dp/B0CHWWLPML?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>   </div> </div><p>The Fast &amp; The Furious Deluxe Cabinet is part of a larger Arcade1Up sales event, which is one of the best we’ve seen this year.

The <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcade1up-classic-se-arcade-machines-pac-man-ms-pac-man-mortal-kombat-amazon-deals/1100-6534472/"">Mortal Kombat II Classic Special Edition</a> is also getting its first price cut. These deals come after the company announced it was closing last week, only to be acquired by toy manufacturer Basic Fun--so it looks like the cabinet brand is, thankfully, sticking around for now.

Local multiplayer is also supported--so if you'd rather not buy two Arcade1Up cabinets and link them together, this is a much cheaper way to get your competitive fix.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcade1ups-the-fast-the-furious-cabinet-deal/1100-6537111/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-20T13:18:21.954530

New Honda Car Lets You Play PS5 Games,"<p>Gaming on the go has been popular among players for decades, and now Sony and Honda are teaming up to bring the power of PlayStation 5 to the road. The two companies formed a joint venture, Sony Honda Mobility, in 2022 to produce electric vehicles. Their first car, the Afeela 1, will be released next year and it will include the capability of playing PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 games.</p><p>However, this a limitation to what players can do with their Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment systems. Sony and Honda aren't including in-car consoles, and they are relying on PlayStation Remote Play for this to work. That means Afeela 1 owners will also need to have either a PS5 or a PS4 at their homes in order to connect with the systems to play games. Sony notes that this use of Remote Play is separate from streaming PS Plus games from the cloud.</p><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4626163-sonyhonda.jpg"" data-ref-id=""1300-4626163"" data-ratio=""0.56230769230769"" data-width=""1300"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 1300px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4626163-sonyhonda.jpg""><img alt=""The Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment system."" src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4626163-sonyhonda.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4626163-sonyhonda.jpg 1300w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4626163-sonyhonda.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1837/18375603/4626163-sonyhonda.jpg 480w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"" data-width=""1280""></a><figcaption>The Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment system.</figcaption></figure><p>This setup includes integrated display and premium audio systems for passengers.

There Is No Xbox Wrapped This Year -- Here’s Why It Might Not Be Happening,"<p>It's almost the end of 2025, and in the spirit of Spotify Wrapped, several big companies have invited subscribers to review their last year of activity.

The year has seen several high-profile releases from the company and the launch of an Xbox-branded handheld gaming PC alongside Asus, but according to <a href=""https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-is-not-doing-an-xbox-wrapped-this-year-but-does-have-big-plans-for-the-25th-anniversary"">Windows Central</a>, Microsoft is allocating its marketing budget toward celebrating several major anniversaries in 2026.</p><p>The Xbox brand celebrates its 25th anniversary next year, Blizzard has its 35th anniversary to look forward to, and Bethesda is turning 40. Those are several significant milestones in proximity to each other, and it's a safe bet that Microsoft wants to accommodate them, possibly explaining the lack of an Xbox Wrapped this year.

Video Game Concept Artists Say GenAI Isn't Making Things Easier,"<p>Generative AI has been at the forefront of the conversation for the past few years, with companies becoming divisive on how to implement it, if at all. Larian CEO Swen Vincke recently kicked a hornet's nest after saying the studios' developers <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/"">use generative AI tools for things like exploring new game ideas, developing concept art, creating placeholder text, and for PowerPoint presentations</a>. After a <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/"">quick retraction and explanation</a>, along with sharing that the studio was in fact growing its pool of artists rather than shrinking. Vincke has admitted that Larian uses AI for tasks nobody wants to do, but does AI--even at the concept art stage--help actual concept artists?</p><p>According to a handful of video game concept artists, it can actually make things harder. Talking to Edmond Tran from <a href=""https://thisweekinvideogames.com/feature/concept-artists-in-games-say-generative-ai-references-only-make-their-jobs-harder/"">This Week In Video Games</a>, artists said that it complicates their workflow and doesn't help them creatively.</p><p>""I'm seeing more and more clients generate something approximating their desired outcome and essentially asking me to make 'something like this,'"" said Paul Scott Canavan, an artist who has worked as an art director and concept artist for projects like Destiny 2, Heroes of the Storm, Guild Wars 2, and Netflix's The Witcher. ""It sucks. This practice absolutely invalidates the entire creative process, in my opinion, and makes my job harder and more frustrating. The job of an illustrator or concept artist is to draw from their years of experience to interpret a brief in a creative way.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-concept-artists-say-genai-isnt-making-things-easier/1100-6537107/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-20T13:18:21.954530

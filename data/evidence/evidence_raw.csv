Iron Lung's success can almost certainly be attributed to its links with mega-popular YouTuber Mark Edward Fischbach - better known as Markiplier - for whom the project's clearly been a labour of love, given he not only self-funded it, but wrote it, directed it, and starred in it too. But whatever there is to be said about the movie (critical opinion is <a href=""https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/iron_lung"">mixed</a>), its headline-making turn has finally given me the nudge to check out the game it's based on, having languished on my Steam wishlist for so long.

It's great because there's often no meaningful alteration in tone to tell you something has changed. Cats are frequently introduced into conversation the same way a person might start talking about an intermittently beloved uncle who's just out of prison. Cats are often delightful reprobates and oddballs. They're needlessly, inventively cruel, or inhumanly calm and forbearing, or they're ostentatiously silly. One will sit on the landing and swipe at everyone. Another will hide under a bath mat, certain that they have attained complete invisibility.

Your character, Takechiyo, is good: noble, just, <em>proper</em>. Your brother, a bitter little rat tempted by ancient powers beyond his understanding (of course), is evil. His desire for power and notoriety is so distinct, in fact, that it has somehow summoned a supernatural 'crucible' from the darkest reaches of space-time, and this consuming chaos is so profound, it has managed to seep into four major eras of Japanese history.

"Hearthstone Isn't Getting A Physical Trading Card Game Anytime Soon, Here's Why","<p dir=""ltr"">Since its release back in 2014, fans of the World of Warcraft-inspired card game Hearthstone have eagerly awaited the day it might make the jump from digital platforms to their tabletops. However, if my conversation with Hearthstone director Tyler Bielman and executive producer Nathan Lyons-Smith is any indication, that won't be happening anytime soon.</p><p dir=""ltr"">During Blizzard's Hearthstone Spotlight event, I spoke to the pair about the future of Hearthstone and its upcoming expansion, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hearthstones-next-expansion-cataclysm-coming-march-17-imagines-if-deathwing-won/1100-6537993/"">Cataclysm</a>.

"Hearthstone's Next Expansion Cataclysm Coming March 17, Imagines If Deathwing Won","<p>Hearthstone is preparing to launch its 12th year with a new Core Set and new expansion, this time based on one of World of Warcraft's most iconic events. The expansion is called Cataclysm, named after the WoW expansion of the same name, but as usual Hearthstone is delivering a twist on what we've come to expect from the Warcraft lore. This time, the apocalyptic dragon aspect Deathwing wins. It will release on March 17.</p><p>In this story, Murozond pulled the victorious Deathwing into the Hearthstone universe, leaving its heroes to defeat the dragon. That effort will be led by Chromie and her Dragonflights, the dragon associated with protecting the timeline, who will pull heroes from across history to defeat this new version of Deathwing.</p><p>Appropriately, this expansion will bring <strong>Colossal minions</strong> back to Hearthstone. First introduced in 2022's Voyage to the Sunken City, these minions spread out their effects across multiple bodies with huge effects. Each class will get its own Colossal minion, and six of them are designated as Deathwing's lieutenants. Meanwhile, two new keywords will be introduced: <strong>Herald</strong> used by those allied with Deathwing with effects that stack the more Herald cards you play; and <strong>Shatter</strong> for the Dragonflights, which split into two halves to give you flexibility or the ability to combine them. There will also be powerful class-based <strong>Triumph</strong> and <strong>Last Stand</strong> spells associated with each class's hero.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hearthstones-next-expansion-cataclysm-coming-march-17-imagines-if-deathwing-won/1100-6537993/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-10T01:16:53.338482
"Arc Raiders’ Lore Is Too ""Curated"" For Fortnite-Style Cosmetics","<p>Embark Studios is very intentional about the cosmetics it adds to its multiplayer shooter <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a>, with the developer's CEO saying that any skins introduced to the game have to fit within its highly curated universe.</p><p>In <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve"">a February 6 IGN interview</a>, Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund explained that while games like Embark's previous game, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-finals/"">The Finals</a>, and <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/"">Fortnite</a> can add whatever character cosmetics they want, Arc Raiders is a bit different. The difference, for Söderlund, is the game’s lore and world, which he described as being ""more curated."" This curation is what prevents Arc Raiders from putting, say, The Grinch or Sonic the Hedgehog in the game.</p><p>""First and foremost, we want to make sure that everything fits the fiction of Arc Raiders, and that it's something that sits well within the Arc Raiders universe,"" Söderlund said. ""I mean, there are other games, very successful games out there--The Finals being one of them--in which the IP is designed so it basically happens to be very elastic. You can do whatever the hell you want, and people are like, 'That makes sense. It's completely plausible.' I can be a pink banana, and you can be whatever, and everyone's like, 'That makes sense. It fits the universe. No problem.' Arc Raiders has a more curated lore, curated world, so we have to stick within boundaries slightly to a different extent than maybe The Finals or Fortnite or another game in which Batman can shoot Bart Simpson.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-lore-is-too-curated-for-fortnite-style-cosmetics/1100-6538042/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-10T01:16:53.338482

"Fallout Actor Was ""Just As Surprised As Everyone Else"" By The Finale's Shocking Reveal","<p>Fallout season two recently wrapped and while the first season eased viewers into the dystopian wasteland created by Bethesda's video games, the show's second season dove deeper into the world in unexpected ways. From introducing the highly popular location of New Vegas, to bringing in popular factions such as Caesar’s Legion and the NCR and introducing some of the game’s strangest creatures, season two felt like an expansion in all the right ways. Yet this wasn't all Fallout season two accomplished; season two also laid the foundation for the franchise going forward by introducing a location new to the franchise: Colorado. Recently I was given the opportunity to travel to Las Vegas to sit down with the cast and crew to talk about this season’s biggest reveals and what’s next for Fallout in season three.</p><p>One of the most satisfying elements this season was getting status updates on factions such as the Legion and the NCR post-Fallout: New Vegas, which last saw them squaring off in a faction war known as The Battle for the Hoover Dam. The show sets up perhaps the largest faction war the franchise has ever seen, with all these forces marching onto the New Vegas strip for an all-out war. Showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet had this to say about what viewers can expect to see during the incoming conflict:</p><p>“It’s interesting that a lot of these factions have been sort of dormant. One thing we talk about as a show is our excitement to see new civilization start to blossom again. But whose version will flourish in Vegas now that the Deathclaws are gone? It’s a big question that we hope fans are as curious about as we are.”</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-actor-was-just-as-surprised-as-everyone-else-by-the-finales-shocking-reveal/1100-6538011/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-10T01:16:53.338482

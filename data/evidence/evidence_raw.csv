Highguard Patch Gives Players What They Really Wanted From The Start,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/highguard/"">Highguard</a> players have shared their desire for expanded match-ups, and the game's developer, Wildlight, has listened. Starting today and going through the weekend, Highguard is introducing an ""experimental"" five-on-five Raid playlist. This isn't meant as a replacement for the game's three-on-three Raids, but it could potentially become a full-time part of the game.</p><p>Per <a href=""https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2017334052865658987"">Wildlight's announcement</a>, the 5v5 Raids will have 10 lives to players instead of the standard six. It will also take slightly longer to respawn during raids in order to allow more time for generator bombs to be planted or defused. Wildlight cautions players that while the current patch has some optimization improvements, 5v5 Raids aren't going to have improved performance.</p><p>The dev team also notes that Firing Range doesn't support 5v5 yet, which is why the Play button will be grayed out when parties are over three.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/highguard-patch-gives-players-what-they-really-wanted-from-the-start/1100-6537815/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-31T00:59:55.895418
Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 Is Further Evidence The Franchise Has Lost What Made It Special,"<p dir=""ltr"">Megan the bear has just informed me that it has been five years and six months since I last booted up Animal Crossing: New Horizons. In the intervening days, the town has changed a lot. There's a coffee shop in the museum now (added in New Horizons 2.0), run by a taciturn pigeon named Brewer. A hotel stands over one of the town's two piers. The first time I visit the resort, Tom Nook immediately ropes me into crafting items to extoll my island's virtues and helping design rooms in the new hotel.</p><p dir=""ltr"">These are substantive changes from the base game, ones that offer welcome expansions to the sometimes-slight feeling original release. Yet, these changes fundamentally enlarge, rather than change, New Horizon's design. The game's recent major update, 3.0, represents a further drift from the frictions and idiosyncrasies that made the Animal Crossing series so beloved in the first place.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Upon launch, New Horizons was somewhat barren, despite all the quality-of-life additions and feature overhauls it brought to the franchise. Standard features of prior games, such as Brewster's café, gyroids, and Kapp'n's boat tours, were totally absent. New Horizon's first major update, released in November 2021, reintroduced most of those features. This 2.0 patch represented a substantial solidifying of the game's basics, though it wasn't enough to lure me back in. <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-missed-the-most-important-part-of-its-franchise-friction/1100-6530181/"">I've written before about my dissatisfaction with New Horizons</a>, and by the time this update rolled around, I was fully put out. Nevertheless, a new update does represent an opportunity to rearrange the game's pieces. After so long away, I was curious about what New Horizons would feel like in my hands.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-is-further-evidence-the-franchise-has-lost-what-made-it-special/1100-6537814/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-31T00:59:55.895418

Some Of Linux's Biggest Players Are Unifying Their Gaming Efforts,"<p>As gaming support on Linux has continued to grow over the past few years several distributions specifically designed around gaming support have become increasingly popular. In order to better serve users going forward, many of them have joined a collective to help focus efforts on better future support and reduce duplicated, time-wasting work.</p><p>The <a href=""https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/a-brighter-future-for-bazzite/11575"">Open Gaming Collective</a> is being contributed to by some of the most prolific gaming Linux distributions around, including Bazzite, Nobara, PikaOS, Playtron, and more. The aim of the collective is to centralize efforts on core component development, such as updates for input managers (for better controller support), gaming-specific packages (such as Gamescope, which is widely used on SteamOS), and kernel improvements. ""This means better hardware compatibility, fewer duplicated efforts, and a more unified Linux gaming experience for everyone,"" the announcement post concludes.</p><p>One such improvement includes widespread support for Secure Boot, which currently isn't supported on Bazzite, one of the best SteamOS alternatives. Secure Boot support has steadily become required for kernel-level anti-cheat software used in <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/"">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/"">Battlefield 6</a>, and <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/highguard/"">Highguard</a>, and is a big reason why multiplayer games are still challenging on Linux.

Ubisoft creative director Fawzi Mesmar confirmed that his team is ""committed and focused on delivering a remarkable game"" on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7421227406130335744/"">LinkedIn</a>.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Spotted by <a href=""https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/director-assures-ubisoft-remains-committed-to-beyond-good-evil-2-despite-recent-upheaval/"">VGC</a>, Mesmar gave the Beyond Good and Evil 2 update after Ubisoft announced more layoffs, studio closures, and <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-canceled-as-ubisoft-axes-and-delays-multiple-projects/1100-6537546/"">the cancellation of the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a>. The creative director noted his team and the long-gestating sequel (possibly a prequel) were ""unaffected,"" while at the same time, adding that he was ""saddened"" by the recent news. This confirms a report last week that <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-good-and-evil-2-is-still-in-development-after-ubisofts-purge-report/1100-6537563/"">Beyond Good and Evil 2 was still in development following the Ubisoft purge</a>.</p><p dir=""ltr""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-good-and-evil-2-is-still-in-development-after-ubisofts-purge-report/1100-6537563/"">Beyond Good and Evil 2 was officially revealed</a> in 2008, while the original game was released in late 2003. Over the past decade, there have been continual confirmations that progress was being made on the game at Ubisoft, particularly after its re-unveiling in 2017.

Nintendo Shifts Blame For Dispatch Switch Version's Censorship As Players Request Refunds,"<p>After Switch owners complained about the superhero comedy <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/dispatch/"">Dispatch</a> forcing censorship on the newly released Nintendo versions of the game, Nintendo released a statement denying that it was directly responsible for this decision.</p><p>The statement (per <a href=""https://gonintendo.com/contents/57182-nintendo-shares-statement-on-dispatch-censorship-debacle-and-it-doesn-t-explain-much"">GoNintendo</a>) reads: ""Nintendo requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organizations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines.

GameStop Could Become A Totally Different Company,"<p>Billionaire GameStop chairman and CEO Ryan Cohen has revealed that he plans to buy a company to help transform GameStop from where it stands today at around an $11 billion market cap to a $100 billion-plus giant that would sell more than video games and collectibles.</p><p>Cohen told <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/gamestop-ceo-plans-e8440c4b"">The Wall Street Journal</a> that he's pursuing a publicly traded company for a buyout, and it would probably be a company in the consumer or retail space.

Google AI Tool Let Users Make Rip-Off Nintendo Worlds,"<p>Google has dropped a new experimental AI called Project Genie, which can create playable worlds that can be explored for around 60 seconds. This technology may not be able to create a fully playable game, but it can apparently emulate some of Nintendo's classic titles.</p><p><a href=""https://www.theverge.com/news/869726/google-ai-project-genie-3-world-model-hands-on"">The Verge</a> has shared its hands-on test with Project Genie, which allowed the outlet to create AI-generated worlds that resemble Super Mario 64, Metroid Prime, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. However, the knock-offs were described as extremely lacking compared to the original titles. The AI prompts can't deliver results as polished as Super Mario 64, an N64 game that came out 30 years ago.</p><p>Curiously, the report notes that Disney characters were blocked from Project Genie, as demonstrated when the outlet attempted to emulate Kingdom Hearts. It's unclear why Nintendo's characters weren't also blocked from the start. According to The Verge, Google finally restricted Nintendo's characters from Project Genie shortly before the outlet's article was published. GameSpot has reached out to both Nintendo and Google for comment.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/google-ai-tool-let-users-make-rip-off-nintendo-worlds/1100-6537791/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-31T00:59:55.895418

Gearbox Lays Out Its Borderlands 4 2026 Roadmap,"<p>This week, Gearbox Studios is starting small with its Borderlands 4 improvements by adding a photo mode. But that's just the first step in the new content roadmap that will take Borderlands 4 through the third quarter of 2026 and beyond.</p><p>Gearbox shared most of the details on <a href=""https://borderlands.2k.com/en-GB/borderlands-4/news/c4sh-vault-hunter-teaser/"">Borderlands' official site</a>. According to the developer, it has taken to heart fan requests for cross-save progression, more endgame content, and new activities. Gearbox is working on those features and the game's performance and stability issues, in addition to planning a new Raid Boss, a Takedown, and more.</p><p>In February, Bounty Pack 2: Legend of the Stone Demon will launch with a new mission, new Legendary gear, and a themed Vault Card featuring 24 cosmetics and four rerollable pieces of gear that are unlocked through gameplay. It's also going to introduce a new tier of gear that goes beyond Legendary: Pearlescent gear. All players will be able to get Pearlescent gear in Borderlands 4, but some of the best pieces will be exclusive to Bounty Pack 2. Note that unlike the first Bounty Pack, Legend of the Stone Demon is a paid DLC.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gearbox-lays-out-its-borderlands-4-2026-roadmap/1100-6537786/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-31T00:59:55.895418

In fact, it seems to cover every facet of the game except its Switch 2 port.</p><p>It's unclear what this means for Switch 2 owners who have been holding out on purchasing the game on another console. When the Switch 2 port was pushed back in September, Gearbox stated that it was ""committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that. Our hope is to also better align this release with the addition of cross saves, which we are working on and recognize is very important.

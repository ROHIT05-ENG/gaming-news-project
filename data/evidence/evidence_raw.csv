Legendary Dev's Long-Lost NES Game Is Getting Its First-Ever Release,"<p>In 2012, programmer Chris Oberth passed away after a career that spanned from the dawn of video games in the late '70s to the PlayStation 2 era. Now, one of Oberth's unfinished games, Xcavator 2025, has been completed and it's slated for a physical release on the console it was originally intended for: the NES.</p><p>The Video Game History Foundation--with the permission and support of Oberth's family--found the source code for Xcavator 2025 in Oberth's development archives. It was originally developed by Incredible Technologies Inc., the company behind the Golden Tee Golf and Big Buck Hunter arcade games. However, it was rejected by publishers in 1991, and it was never seen again until now.</p><p>To finish the game, the VGHF teamed up with Mega Cat Studios, which was guided by the remaining materials to recapture the spirit of Oberth's original vision. Towards that end, Mega Cat Studios' development team only used the tools and environments that would have been available at the time. A standalone trailer for Xcavator 2025 isn't available yet, but the first footage was screened during the Day of the Devs: The Game Awards Edition at the 1 hour 43:31 mark below.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legendary-devs-long-lost-nes-game-is-getting-its-first-ever-release/1100-6536857/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-11T13:52:41.972535

Berseria follows Velvet Crowe, a young woman bent on vengeance after the murder of her brother. It's a deep, emotional tale of self-reflection and the power of letting go. Despite launching <em>after </em>Zestria, Berseria's prequel story is approachable even if you haven't played Zestria. In fact, like the majority of the Tales series, you can play Tales of Berseria without prior knowledge of the other games. It even seems like Bandai Namco plans for new players to start here, considering Zestria has not been remastered yet. With the cadence of remastered Tales games, it seems to only be a matter of time before Bandai Namco announces a remaster of Tales of Zestiria to give both new fans and veterans alike the complete story with modern improvements.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tales-of-berseria-remastered-brings-the-game-to-switch-and-xbox-for-the-first-time-preorders-now-live/1100-6536816/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-11T13:52:41.972535

Over the course of 90-plus levels, Astro Bot makes brilliant use of the DualSense's adaptive triggers, haptic feedback, touch panel, gyro controls, and built-in speaker. From a mechanical perspective, Astro Bot is arguably the most inventive and playful 3D platformer ever made.</p><p>Astro Bot also doubles as a celebration of all things PlayStation. You'll meet little robots themed around other PlayStation heroes and heroines, including Ratchet, Rivet, Kratos, Atreus, Aloy, Nathan Drake, Sly Cooper, Jak, Crash Bandicoot, and many more. Some of the levels are even themed around different franchises and implement mechanics from those games.</p><p>Astro Bot earned a <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/astro-bot-review-fly-me-to-the-moon/1900-6418277/"">9/10 in GameSpot's review</a> and won GOTY at last year's Game Awards.</p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5SM3K4Q?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                                                      <div>                        <a href=""https://sonyps.prf.hn/click/camref:1110l56fv/pubref:subid_value/destination:https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-games/astro-bot-ps5"">See at PS Direct</a>           </div>                                                                                                             <div>                        <a href=""https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Astro-Bot-PlayStation-5/6261168812&subId1=subid_value"">See at Walmart</a>           </div>                                    </div>      </div>   </div> </div><div title=""[Amazon Hub] [DualSense] [PS BF2025] PS5 Controllers"" data-embed-type=""buylink"" data-ref-id=""5074"" data-template=""2"" data-size=""buylink__large"" data-title=""[Amazon Hub] [DualSense] [PS BF2025] PS5 Controllers"" data-collection="""" class=""norewrite"">    <div class=""buylink__container"">                                                                                                                                                                                               <div class=""buylink__item"">                  <div class=""buylink__image-container clickable"">                                            <img class=""buylink__image"" src=https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4608555-dualsensecontrollers.png alt="""">                                 <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&isPreview=1&asins=B0CQKLS4RP,B0CQKKHT5J,B0DHY92HBL,B0CJTCQRNL,B0CJT9WCRD,B0CJSY6961,B0CQKLDWY8,B0CQKL4YTB,B0DSQQ1P8D,B0BSYFB99D,B0DHY8DC6R,B0DHY9CZ61,B0DSLTZ6M3,B0CJT5DJ16,B094WN6SY2,B09RBZ134K,B0FMKQFNFN,B0FPMXPK34,B0FST1H26R&tag=gamespot-promos-20""></a>                              </div>                   <div class=""buylink__text"">                      <p class=""buylink__title text-bold"">                        <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&isPreview=1&asins=B0CQKLS4RP,B0CQKKHT5J,B0DHY92HBL,B0CJTCQRNL,B0CJT9WCRD,B0CJSY6961,B0CQKLDWY8,B0CQKL4YTB,B0DSQQ1P8D,B0BSYFB99D,B0DHY8DC6R,B0DHY9CZ61,B0DSLTZ6M3,B0CJT5DJ16,B094WN6SY2,B09RBZ134K,B0FMKQFNFN,B0FPMXPK34,B0FST1H26R&tag=gamespot-promos-20"">DualSense Controller Black Friday Deals</a>           </p>                                                       <p class=""buylink__deck"">                          <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&isPreview=1&asins=B0CQKLS4RP,B0CQKKHT5J,B0DHY92HBL,B0CJTCQRNL,B0CJT9WCRD,B0CJSY6961,B0CQKLDWY8,B0CQKL4YTB,B0DSQQ1P8D,B0BSYFB99D,B0DHY8DC6R,B0DHY9CZ61,B0DSLTZ6M3,B0CJT5DJ16,B094WN6SY2,B09RBZ134K,B0FMKQFNFN,B0FPMXPK34,B0FST1H26R&tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Save $20 on all colors.</a>             </p>                                              </div>                  <div class=""buylink__links"">                                                                                                                                                          <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&isPreview=1&asins=B0CQKLS4RP,B0CQKKHT5J,B0DHY92HBL,B0CJTCQRNL,B0CJT9WCRD,B0CJSY6961,B0CQKLDWY8,B0CQKL4YTB,B0DSQQ1P8D,B0BSYFB99D,B0DHY8DC6R,B0DHY9CZ61,B0DSLTZ6M3,B0CJT5DJ16,B094WN6SY2,B09RBZ134K,B0FMKQFNFN,B0FPMXPK34,B0FST1H26R&tag=gamespot-promos-20"">See at Amazon</a>                     </div>                         </div>                     </div> </div><h2><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D5SM3K4Q,B095T8C99C,B0F19GPDW3,B0C7WQRCPB,B08QFWWJ8K,B0BPMTJJ6D,B0CGXZQ4CD,B08XNRM6QN,B09SW6GCGL,B0CTVK7GBM,B0CJGPSXG4,B0CPYSPHR1,B0B3QWRQL8,B0CP4DCK45,B08FC5TTBF,B08QFPS48J,B09Z7JZW4P,B09RDRYF8L,B0CK4VWNYL,B0DX42RXMS,B0DD8TMP2Y,B0B61YDF5V,B09N848WMD,B08FC64CNF,B08JHQ4NBB,B0DWYP2PXP,B08QFZCGVJ,B098G34GBT,B08NX8F4W1&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20"">PlayStation Holiday 2025 Game Deals</a></h2><p>PlayStation's Holiday Sale features a bunch of other notable game deals, including <a href=""https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsonyps.prf.hn%2Fclick%2Fcamref%3A1110l56fv%2Fpubref%3Asubid_value%2Fdestination%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-games%2Fratchet-clank-rift-apart-ps5&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Ffeeds%2Fnews%2F&event_type=click"">Ratchet &amp;

"United Kingdom's Ministers Will ""Look Into"" Rockstar's Dev Firings, Says Prime Minister","<p>At the end of October, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/"">Rockstar fired over 30 employees</a> at Rockstar North in the United Kingdom and contended that they were let go over ""gross misconduct."" The Grand Theft Auto developer has since been accused of union busting, since many of the fired devs were either members of the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain or organizing for it. Now, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Keir Starmer, and a member of Parliament, are keeping up the pressure on Rockstar.</p><p>""It's a deeply concerning case,"" said Starmer. ""Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union. Our ministers will look into the particular case the member raises and will keep him updated.""</p><p>The case was brought up by Edinburgh East and Musselburgh MP, Chris Murray, who met with Rockstar on behalf of the workers. Murray noted that Rockstar initially refused to meet with him unless an NDA was signed, but the company relented following his refusal. Murray also stated that he was unconvinced by Rockstar's account of the firings.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/united-kingdoms-ministers-will-look-into-rockstars-dev-firings-says-prime-minister/1100-6536840/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-11T13:52:41.972535

The arm also features a cushioned interior, ensuring it won't scuff up your device.</span></p><p>You can use the trackpad to simulate left clicks and right clicks, and there's even an option to change the keyboard light brightness and color.

One Of The Best Nintendo 64 Platformers Is Coming To Nintendo Switch Online,"<p>An absolute classic is one of two Nintendo 64 games set to join the Nintendo Classics library this month. Rayman 2: The Great Escape and Tonic Trouble, both from Ubisoft, will be available to play for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers starting December 17.</p><p>Rayman 2 was originally released in 1999 for Nintendo 64 and PC, with ports on Dreamcast, PlayStation, and other platforms following in subsequent years.

GameStop's Struggles Continue,"<p>GameStop has released its <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000132638025000098/gme-20251101.htm"">latest earnings report</a>, shining a light on how the video game retailer is performing in the market--and it was a mixed quarter for the company.</p><p>Revenue came in at $821 million, compared to $860.3 million during the same period last year, and short of Wall Street projections. Profit, however, soared from $17.4 million last year to $77.1 million for the latest period. GameStop's stock price sank after the earnings report came out, with many saying the revenue miss was to blame for the falling price.</p><p>Others, however, have said GameStop's strong profit-growth, along with having more than $8.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (up from $4.6 billion last year) is a sign of health. Additionally, GameStop's Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&amp;A) costs were $221.4 million for the quarter, down from $282 million during the same period last year.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-stock-slumps-as-games-and-hardware-sales-decline/1100-6536830/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-11T13:52:41.972535

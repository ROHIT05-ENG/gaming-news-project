Its humour is pitch black, yes, and its comedic moments often dance on a knife's edge between laughter and revulsion, but writer and director Andrea Lucco Borlera's first-person narrative horror - his debut game, created in close collaboration with Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione - is a fascinatingly singular vision. It's singular enough, in fact, that it's not an easy thing to effectively describe, but if you can imagine a sort of thematic reinterpretation of Animal Farm by way of Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salo on one side, and a meme-able Garry's Mod video on the other, then Horses gleefully oscillates between them, landing somewhere in the middle.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-review"">Read more</a></p>",2025-12-09T03:42:13.619502

On the other, it is something new for the series, structurally most comparable not to other Metroid games but rather to a different Nintendo adventure franchise (more on that shortly). Then there is how the game is built, feeling almost modular, with different modes and moods of play stitched together with visible seams.

A Full Star Wars: KOTOR 2 Remake Was In Development - Report,"<p>For a minute there, a full-on remake of Obsidian Entertainment's <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith/"">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2</a> was apparently in development. However, the project appears to have been put on hold, according to a new report.</p><p>According to <a href=""https://www.gamefile.news/p/kotor-ii-restored-content-mod-dlc-switch-killed-disney"">Game File's reporting</a>, new legal documents revealed that Aspyr and Lucasfilm Games were working on a full remake of KOTOR 2. Codenamed ""Juliet"" in the files, the project was a modern remake of the iconic 2004 RPG and was in development alongside the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake/"">KOTOR remake</a>, which developer Saber Interactive said is <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-is-still-coming-says-developer/1100-6526585/"">still coming</a>. However, per Game File and unlike the KOTOR remake, development on the KOTOR II remake has ceased as recently as March 2025. Lucasfilm Games VP Douglas Reilly explained in depositions about the drama surrounding KOTOR II that, had the remake come to fruition, it would've contained the cut DLC that was teased when <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-kotor-2-with-restored-content-launches-for-switch-june-8/1100-6503963/"">the game was announced for Nintendo Switch in 2022</a>.</p><p>""'Juliet' was the codename for a project where we were going to do a full remake of KOTOR II,"" Reilly said. [It would have featured] modern art, modern gameplay, you know, keep the story and the characters and the general--the general content of KOTOR II, but remake it for modern hardware and modern machines with updated graphics and all those kinds of things. It was something we were discussing with Aspyr. ... The plan was that we would remake the content that was in the RCM as it relates to Star Wars in that Juliet project.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-full-star-wars-kotor-2-remake-was-in-development-report/1100-6536775/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-09T03:42:13.619502

While the story starts as a fun fantasy adventure with equal parts homage and satire of the swords-and-sorcery genre, it slowly evolves into a sprawling epic with deep character development, and big narrative payoffs for longtime fans. The show is critically acclaimed for its strong storytelling and even stronger cast of characters, and its success has led to several spin-off projects, such as the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Adventure-Time-Distant-Lands-Blu-ray/dp/B09NMZCMBK?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Adventure Time: Distant Lands limited series</a>, which is available on Blu-ray, and it's currently on sale for $12 (was $20) at Amazon.</p><p>Adventure Time isn't the only beloved Cartoon Network series on DVD.

"Microsoft Initially Rejected Idea To Bring Flight Simulator To PS5, Dev Says","<p>Microsoft originally rejected a pitch to bring Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 to PlayStation consoles, but the company eventually agreed, and this led to a ""whole avalanche"" of Xbox games on PlayStation. That's according to Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator Jorg Neumann.</p><p>He told <a href=""https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-interview/"">XDA-Developers</a> that it was his own idea to bring Flight Simulator to PlayStation consoles, culminating with the launch of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 today, December 8, on PS4 and PS5.</p><p>The 2020 Flight Simulator game eventually grew to become 300 GB in size, and there was so much content planned that Neumann said the game could grow to become 1 TB. So instead of doing that, the team made a new game, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and the game now only has 8 GB of space for a requirement, with everything else sent to the cloud. This way of packaging the game allowed the game to come to other platforms, Neumann said.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-initially-rejected-idea-to-bring-flight-simulator-to-ps5-dev-says/1100-6536767/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-09T03:42:13.619502

Tekken Boss Katsuhiro Harada Is Leaving Bandai Namco After 30 Years Of Iron Fist Tournaments,"<p>Tekken development chief Katsuhiro Harada has announced that he'll be departing from the fighting game series and its publisher Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. Harada--who has worked on every Tekken game since the series first debuted in 1994--said in a social media post that the death of close friends in his life had led to him to consider how much time he had left as a creator, and after consulting PlayStation icon Ken Kutaragi, he decided to leave the publisher after spending 30 years working on the Tekken franchise.</p><p>""With the Tekken series reaching its 30th anniversary--an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to--I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close,"" Harada wrote in an online post. ""In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect. Those accumulated events made me reflect on the 'time I have left as a creator.' During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi--whom I respect as though he were another father--and received invaluable encouragement and guidance.

Netflix Considered Buying EA - Report,"<p>As 2025 winds down, the new biggest potential acquisitions of the year appear to be the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/"">$55 billion deal</a> for EA by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and other investors and the more recent proposed <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-announces-purchase-of-warner-bros-for-over-82-billion/1100-6536717/"">$82 billion agreement</a> for Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Studios. Now, a new report suggests that Netflix once considered buying EA and two other movie studios before the Warner Bros. negotiations came together.</p><p>According to <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-07/netflix-co-ceo-ted-sarandos-wooed-trump-personally-ahead-of-warner-bid"">Bloomberg</a>, Netflix executives previously debated whether the streamer should place bids for EA, Fox, and Disney. However, the management team reportedly couldn't agree on a deal and feared that its interest in those companies would hurt its standing with investors.</p><p>The report doesn't include the details about when Netflix considered these acquisitions, especially since Disney is usually the company that buys other studios including Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. Disney purchased Fox's entertainment assets in 2019 following an extended approval process from government agencies around the world.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-considered-buying-ea-report/1100-6536751/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-09T03:42:13.619502

Five Nights At Freddy's 2 Defies Poor Reviews With Big Opening Weekend,"<p>Last week, the early word on <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-five-nights-at-freddys-2-trailer-is-very-scary/1100-6535945/"">Five Nights At Freddy's 2</a> from critics <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/five-nights-at-freddys-2-movie-reviews-are-beary-bad/1100-6536721/"">was overwhelmingly negative</a>, with only 12% on Rotten Tomatoes. It didn't matter to moviegoers, however, as audiences showed up to theaters to check out the sequel anyway.</p><p>According to <a href=""https://deadline.com/2025/12/box-office-five-nights-at-freddys-2-zootopia-2-1236637393/"">Deadline</a>, Five Nights At Freddy's 2 had a $63 million opening weekend in the United States and Canada, and $46 million internationally against a reported $36-$51 million budget. That gave the film a $109 million global opening. The first Five Nights At Freddy's had a higher opening in 2023 with $80 million domestically, despite being released in tandem with the film's streaming premiere on Peacock.</p><p>Regardless, this sequel's opening was big enough to kick Disney's Zootopia 2 out of the No. 1 slot after only a single weekend. It also earned Five Nights At Freddy's 2 a few box office records, including biggest opening for a post-Thanksgiving weekend, biggest December opening for a horror film, and the biggest December opening for Universal Pictures. Additionally, Five Nights At Freddy's 2 now has the third-highest grossing opening weekend for a PG-13 horror movie, behind only the original Five Nights At Freddy's and World War Z, which had $80 million and $66.4 million, respectively.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/five-nights-at-freddys-2-defies-poor-reviews-with-big-opening-weekend/1100-6536749/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-09T03:42:13.619502

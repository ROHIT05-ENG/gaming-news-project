"Horses Was Successful Despite Steam And Epic Store Bans, But It May Not Be Enough","<p>Developer Santa Ragione is reporting that its controversial indie horror game <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/"">Horses</a> sold 18,000 copies in two weeks. That was apparently enough to save the studio from financial ruin, but perhaps not enough to pay for production a second game.</p><p>According to a statement released by the developers, Horses generated $65,000 in net revenue, which allowed Santa Ragione to repay its loans and pay the royalties it owed to Andrea Lucco Borlera, the author and creator of Horses. However, the income won't allow the team to immediately begin working on another game.</p><p>""This result is not enough to begin production on a new game,"" reads the statement. ""The money primarily covers obligations created by a prolonged end of development. If sales remain steady, we may be able to fund a new prototype in the future, but the team has had to, and will continue to, take other jobs and projects in the meantime. Reuniting everyone will not be easy, even if it is something we would love.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horses-was-successful-despite-steam-and-epic-store-bans-but-it-may-not-be-enough/1100-6537068/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-18T03:45:43.875527
Dying Light: The Beast Update Introduces Nightmare Experience,"<p>If you've been looking for more of a challenge from <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/dying-light-the-beast/"">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, then you're about to get it. Developer Techland has dropped Update 1.5 for Dying Light: The Beast, and it's giving players the chance to test their skills in the Nightmare Experience.</p><p>To turn up the heat on players, human and infected enemies are now smarter, more aggressive, significantly stronger, and more reactive to the players' actions. Volatiles may now even appear during the day in some of the Dark Zones, and players have far fewer resources to deal with them all.</p><p>If that wasn't enough, there's a new super enemy, the Alpha Volatile. Techland calls it ""the most intelligent Volatile in the history of Dying Light."" It's even smarter than the traditional Volatiles and its heightened senses can track the player across the entire map unless they reach a safe zone. The Alpha Volatiles can be killed, but good luck trying to pull that off. At night, the player is the prey for this creature.

Preorders for the It: Welcome to Derry Limited Edition Steelbook initially sold out in hours, but it's <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G4RZDHJD?tag=gamespot-preorders-20"">back in stock at Amazon for $45</a> and <a href=""https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FIT-Welcome-to-Derry-The-Complete-First-Season-Steelbook-4K-Ultra-HD-Warner-Horror%252F18932711459%26partnerpropertyid%3D1423009&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Ffeeds%2Fmashup%2F&event_type=click"">Walmart for $57</a>. If you're a Stephen King fan, it'd probably be wise to preorder ASAP. Steelbook Editions of the two-part It film adaptation sold out fast, and Welcome to Derry is the first TV series based on a Stephen King novel to get a 4K Blu-ray edition. At this time, the Limited Edition Steelbook is the only way to get the series on 4K Blu-ray.</p><p>Welcome to Derry: Season 1 is available to stream in full on <a href=""https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.max.com%252F&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Ffeeds%2Fmashup%2F&event_type=click"">HBO Max</a>. Alternatively, you can buy Season 1 on other streaming platforms like <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Welcome-Derry-Season-1/dp/B0F6DTHQP7?tag=gamespot-entertainment-20"">Amazon Prime Video for $22</a>.</p><p>Welcome to Derry holds an 80% on <a href=""https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/it_welcome_to_derry"">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, and I think many longtime fans of King's legendary horror novel would say Season 1 was pretty great. HBO has yet to renew the series for a second season, but director Andy Muschietti has a three-season arc in mind. Season 1 tells the story of Pennywise's reign of terror in 1962. Season 2 would rewind the clock 27 years to Pennywise's previous feeding cycle in 1935, and Season 3 would be set in 1908.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-welcome-to-derry-season-one-4k-blu-ray-steelbook-preorder-guide/1100-6536970/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-18T03:45:43.875527

The slipcase also pays tribute to the film series, featuring artwork showcasing various images of the bandits and the vehicles that hunted down Max and Furiosa throughout each movie.</p><p>This collection includes a curated selection of special features pulled from previous Blu-ray releases. You can sit down for several behind-the-scenes documentaries, deleted scenes, and featurettes that explore the chaotic world of the film series. What makes this edition special is that it is the only 4K Blu-ray box set to include the physical Black &amp; Chrome editions of Fury Road and Furiosa. Both movies look stunning in black and white, as each film was re-graded to create striking images bereft of color.</p><p>The only downside to this collection is that there are no special features included for Beyond Thunderdome.

Silent Hill F Producer Hints At Future Sequels Set Outside Of US,"<p>Earlier this year, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/"">Silent Hill f</a> became the first game in the series to ditch the small American town that the series was named for in favor of setting it in Japan decades earlier. That approach may be used again for future titles in the franchise, according to developer Motoi Okamoto.</p><p>""We believe we could perhaps take similar approaches with other cultures across the globe,"" Okamoto told <a href=""https://www.inverse.com/gaming/silent-hill-interview-okamoto-konami-americas"">Inverse</a> through a translator. ""For example, in Central or South America, we could perhaps tap into the more local, shamanistic beliefs and see how that ties in. But we could also try to expand our horizons and look into other regions, like possibly Russia, Italy, or South Korea, because all those areas have their own unique types of belief systems. I believe that will be a gateway for us to expand our concepts further.""</p><p>Okamoto appears to have put the most thought into the Central and South American locations, which he said have ""been affected by a lot of military governments and coups,"" before adding, ""There is a type of bravado and 'machismo' that comes from these political landscapes. There’s also the more folkloric angle coming from shamanism and local beliefs.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-producer-hints-at-future-sequels-set-outside-of-us/1100-6537063/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-18T03:45:43.875527

A 92-Year-Old Just Won A Tekken 8 Tournament,"<p>For three decades, the Tekken series has brought players together as they control of some of the best fighters in the world. Now, a 92-year-old Japanese woman named Hisako Sakai has carved out her own legend in the King of the Iron Ring battles by winning a <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/tekken-8/"">Tekken 8</a> tournament.</p><p>As reported by <a href=""https://automaton-media.com/en/news/92-year-old-grandma-wins-tekken-8-tournament-trophy-in-japanese-senior-citizen-esports-league/"">Automaton</a>, the tournament of senior citizen Tekken 8 players was put on by the Japanese eSports association Care. The mission statement of that organization is to ""create an environment in which the elderly can casually participate in eSports."" Care has been running tournaments since 2019 while treating them like a major event with livestreaming and official commentators. A video from the event can be seen below.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cj0XFWPkA8"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5cj0XFWPkA8"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Sakai made it all the way to the finals while playing as Claudio, when she went up against 74-year-old player Goro Sugiyama, who used Lili as his character. The match between Sakai and Sugiyama can be found two hours and 25 minutes into the video above. Despite the advantage of Sugiyama's relative youth, Sakai appears to have a superior button-mashing technique and enough mastery of the game to execute an effective path to victory.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-92-year-old-just-won-a-tekken-8-tournament/1100-6537056/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-18T03:45:43.875527

Kinect's Revenge: Nex Playground Outsells Xbox Hardware In The US,"<p dir=""ltr"">The conventional wisdom is that Kinect was an albatross on Xbox One, making the system more expensive at launch and taking away resource power.

Warner Bros. Urges Shareholders To Reject Paramount's Rival Bid For The Studio,"<p>The battle for Warner Bros. may be down to Netflix and Paramount, but the studio has a clear favorite.

The higher average selling price is connected to the price increases that companies like Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, and others have implemented this year due to tariffs and other factors.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hardware-sales-in-the-us-just-had-worst-month-in-30-years/1100-6537041/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-18T03:45:43.875527

Diablo 4's Goblin Greedings Lets You Beat Up Goblins For More Loot,"<p>It's not an easy life for Sanctuary's citizens in <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/"">Diablo 4</a>, but players can make things a little brighter in the upcoming holiday event Goblin Greedings. Starting on December 18, players will be to put presents under their tree--so to speak--by clobbering creatures for loot and bringing a little hope back to Estuar.</p><p>To claim their prizes, players will have to face hordes of Treasure Goblins and earn their place on the March of the Goblins reputation board. There are multiple tiers to unlock, and players can claim their prizes between each one by visiting the Goblin Square in Kyovashad. Once players complete the final tier, they will be given a Resplendent Spark. That final tier is repeatable, and the quality of the loot dropped by enemies will increase with each tier. However, players will only have until January 6, 2026 to work their way through and claim as much treasure as they can.</p><p>Returning Grim Favors during Goblin Greedings will also give players an additional cache for Gift of the Tree. All they need to do to claim it is to select a cache, which will reveal the treasure they've been given by the Gift of the Tree.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-goblin-greedings-lets-you-beat-up-goblins-for-more-loot/1100-6537036/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-18T03:45:43.875527

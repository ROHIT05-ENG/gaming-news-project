It is, admittedly, a bit of a weird one to get to grips with at first: an online multiplayer Soulslike with players racing around a map as preset characters preparing to defeat Nightlord bosses in grand, operatic fashion. But now, players have learned the map, the character movesets, they've collected powerful Relics to buff abilities, and are familiar with the weakness of each boss. Coordination with others is less of an immediate issue than it was, so even playing with random players is no longer a chore.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hallows-dlc-review"">Read more</a></p>",2025-12-16T03:48:47.038619

Xbox is officially 25 years old next year and Microsoft has teased a ""major"" 2026 as it prepares to celebrate the OG console's anniversary in a big way. And those plans might just include more classic Xbox titles heading to Game Pass, depending how you choose to interpret the words of Xbox's vice president of next-gen gaming devices and ecosystem, Jason Ronald.

Sure, my hands are two rigid claws, my pre-arthritic joints are flaring up like a Guy Fawkes bonfire. My janky left shoulder is twinging, as it does when I get caught up doing computery things, and my heart is beating in the heels of my palms from deathgripping my controller. Frankly, this is just how movement-intense, combo-centric gaming feels when you're not a svelte, well-oiled machine anymore. I'm a desk jockey made of SSRIs and pain, and I must skate.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-story-review"">Read more</a></p>",2025-12-16T03:48:47.038619

"Diablo 4: Lord Of Hatred Brings Back Everyone's Favorite ""Hot Mom,"" Amazons, And Lorath","<p>After two and a half years, eleven seasons, and one massive, game-changing expansion, Diablo 4's Age of Hatred is finally coming to a close. Announced as part of 2025's The Game Awards, Diablo 4's next expansion, Lord of Hatred, marks the end of the game's ongoing saga--one which has seen Lilith, Inarius, Mephisto, and the humans of Sanctuary engage in an epic struggle to gain control of the world and its future. But while the upcoming expansion promises a ""satisfying"" conclusion and an ""epic, final showdown"" with the game's big bad, Mephisto, it also promises a number of other exciting features, too.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Prior to the expansion's announcement, GameSpot, IGN, and PC Gamer were invited to attend an exclusive interview with two key members of Lord of Hatred's narrative team: lead narrative designer Matt Burns and narrative designer Eleni Rivera. The pair were eager to answer our questions about Lord of Hatred, even those that were, admittedly, both thirsty and bizarre. We left the Q&amp;A session with a better understanding of Mephisto's plans, the lore behind the revamped Paladin class, and the Skovos Isles, as well as a great deal of anticipation--anticipation for more personality-filled dialogue options, plenty of ""Jedi mind tricks,"" and the return of Amazons, Lilith, and Ralph Ineson's velvety voice.</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>IGN: Vessel of Hatred felt like you guys were holding your breath. Was that a Band-Aid or a part of the story that you always wanted to tell? I'm sure you guys heard a little bit of the feedback that Vessel of Hatred was good and also felt like it was teasing out of the showdown that we were all really waiting for. I'm wondering how much of that was planned versus you guys just taking longer to produce this big showdown.</strong></p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-lord-of-hatred-brings-back-everyones-favorite-hot-mom-amazons-and-lorath/1100-6536976/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-16T03:48:47.038619

Lost Sega Channel Games Saved In Latest VGHF Project,"<p>Over 140 ROMs from Sega's long defunct Sega Channel, including service-exclusive games that were thought lost to time and never-before-published prototypes, have now been recovered thanks to the latest efforts of the Video Game History Foundation.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Sega Channel launched in 1994 and was one of the first subscription-based, digital game services, beaming new games and content directly to players' consoles through a television cable.

HBO has yet to renew the series for a second season, but director Andy Muschietti has a three-season arc in mind. Season 1 tells the story of Pennywise's reign of terror in 1962. Season 2 would rewind the clock 27 years to Pennywise's previous feeding cycle in 1935, and Season 3 would be set in 1908.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-welcome-to-derry-season-one-4k-blu-ray-steelbook-preorder-guide/1100-6536970/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-16T03:48:47.038619

These Four Bleach Characters Are Coming To Fortnite This Week,"<p>Epic Games loves collaborating with anime series for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/"">Fortnite</a>, and it's no mystery why to anybody who's been constantly battling Gokus, Narutos, Gojos and All Mights in Battle Royale for years. Anime skins are clearly popular, so it makes sense that more are coming. Next up is Bleach, the beloved show that began in the 2004, and which is currently running a revival series to finish telling the manga's story, called Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War.</p><p>This first collaboration with Bleach will, according to <a href=""https://x.com/HYPEX/status/2000419616485736876"">posters that have been spotted in the wild</a>, include four skins: Ichigo Kurosaki, Rukia Kuchiki, Orihime Inoue, and Uryu Ishida.

The movies alone would be a bargain at this price, but The James Bond Collection also comes with over 120 hours of special features.</p><p>The discs are packaged in a slipcase with three oversized plastic cases. The box comes with a white slipcover featuring each of the six James Bond actors in their title card poses.</p><p>The only Bond movie from the Eon Productions catalog not featured in this box set is Daniel Craig's final appearance as 007, the 2021 film No Time to Die.</p><p>Complete your Bond Blu-ray collection:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/No-Time-Die-Daniel-Craig/dp/B0CLVQ98WC?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">No Time to Die (Blu-ray)</a> -- $10 (<del>$20</del>)</li><li><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/No-Time-Die-Daniel-Craig/dp/B0CLVMYX7H?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">No Time to Die (4K)</a> -- $16.57 (<del>$22</del>)</li></ul></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IQJ3LOI?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>                                                                     <div class=""js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container"">             <h2 class=""item-title"">                    <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/James-Bond-Collection-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B09Q6F7LC8?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">007: James Bond - Daniel Craig 5-Film Collection (4K Blu-ray)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=""item-deck"">                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/James-Bond-Collection-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B09Q6F7LC8?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">$38 (was $90)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=""image-container"">                                  <img class=""main-image"" src=https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1595/15950357/4613493-danielcraig5-film.png>                             <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/James-Bond-Collection-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B09Q6F7LC8?tag=gamespot-promos-20""></a>                        </div>              <div class=""item-description""><p>Alternatively, you could complete your James Bond collection by picking up The Daniel Craig 5-Film Collection on 4K Blu-ray for $38--only $3 more than its Black Friday price.

If this bothers you, the Nintendo Switch version has the full game on the card and is fully playable on Nintendo's new console.</p><p>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake earned favorable reviews from critics; it holds an <a href=""https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake/"">84 Metascore</a> on GameSpot sister site Metacritic. Just like Square's other HD-2D remakes, the first two Dragon Quest games look and run beautifully on all platforms. The updated visuals are bolstered by the new orchestral soundtrack. Square Enix implemented a bevy of welcome gameplay changes to give players more customization options. You'll also find new dungeons, meet new characters, and watch a more cohesive story unfold between the two games and DQIII. The first game is still a solo adventure for the Hero, but a new playable character in the sequel gives you the chance to have a ""modern four-member party.</p><p>If you're in the mood for a couple of thoroughly retro turn-based RPGs that don't feel like a full-time job, this collection is well-worth checking out. Dragon Quest I can be completed in 10-15 hours, and the sequel is roughly 20 hours.</p><p><strong>Amazon Deals:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F2NZ8LKV?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Nintendo Switch</a> -- $40 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9ZT5MH9?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Nintendo Switch 2</a> -- $40 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F2P6LNLM?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">PS5</a> -- $50 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F2NX9G77?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Xbox Series X</a> -- $50 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul><p><strong>Target Deals:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=""https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.target.com%252Fp%252Fdragon-quest-i-38-ii-hd-2d-remake-nintendo-switch%252F-%252FA-94685787%2523lnk%253Dsametab%26partnerpropertyid%3D1423009&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Ffeeds%2Fnews%2Ftags%2Frockstar-games&event_type=click"">Nintendo Switch</a> -- $40 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href=""https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.target.com%252Fp%252Fdragon-quest-i-38-ii-hd-2d-remake-nintendo-switch-2%252F-%252FA-94781027%2523lnk%253Dsametab%26partnerpropertyid%3D1423009&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Ffeeds%2Fnews%2Ftags%2Frockstar-games&event_type=click"">Nintendo Switch 2</a> -- $40 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&isPreview=1&asins=B0F2NZ8LKV,B0F9ZT5MH9,B0F2P6LNLM,B0F2NX9G77&tag=gamespot-promos-20"">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                                                      <div>                        <a href=""https://goto.target.com/c/1804712/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fs%3FsearchTerm%3DDragon%2BQuest%2BI&partnerpropertyid=1423009"">See at Target</a>           </div>                                                                                                             <div>                        <a href=""https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Ddragon%2Bquest%2BI&partnerpropertyid=1423009"">See at Walmart</a>           </div>                                    </div>      </div>                                                                     <div class=""js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container"">             <h2 class=""item-title"">                    <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&isPreview=1&asins=B0D71SHR5B,B0D71JQXR4,B0D71HX7PY&tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake (Switch 1/2, PS5, Xbox)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=""item-deck"">                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&isPreview=1&asins=B0D71SHR5B,B0D71JQXR4,B0D71HX7PY&tag=gamespot-promos-20"">$35 (was $60)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=""image-container"">                                  <img class=""main-image"" src=https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1595/15950357/4593586-dragonquestiii.png>                             <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&isPreview=1&asins=B0D71SHR5B,B0D71JQXR4,B0D71HX7PY&tag=gamespot-promos-20""></a>                        </div>              <div class=""item-description""><p>The Nintendo Switch and PS5 editions of Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake are on sale for only $35 at <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D71SHR5B,B0D71JQXR4,B0D71HX7PY&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Amazon</a>.

The Switch 2 upgrade can be downloaded for free from the eShop.</p><p>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake completed Square Enix's Erdrick Trilogy--also known as Roto/Loto Trilogy--remake project that started last year with Dragon Quest III. The remakes were released in this order, because the third numbered entry actually takes place before DQ1. So if you're interested in trying classic Dragon Quest for the first time, Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is a great place to start.</p><p>Dragon Quest III was the first entry in the series to feature a job system and emphasize working alongside your companions as a true party. It's also a much larger game, with more places to explore and longer runtime; it takes roughly as long to beat DQIII as it does to clear the first two games combined.</p><p><strong>Amazon Deals:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D71SHR5B?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Nintendo Switch</a> -- $35 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D71JQXR4?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">PS5</a> -- $35 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D71HX7PY?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Xbox Series X</a> -- $32 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul><p><strong>Walmart Deals:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=""https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FDragon-Quest-III-HD-2D-Remake-PlayStation-5%252F5975939250%26partnerpropertyid%3D1423009&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Ffeeds%2Fnews%2Ftags%2Frockstar-games&event_type=click"">PS5</a> -- $35 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul><p><strong>Target Deals:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=""https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.target.com%252Fp%252Fdragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-xbox-series-x%252F-%252FA-92606569%26partnerpropertyid%3D1423009&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Ffeeds%2Fnews%2Ftags%2Frockstar-games&event_type=click"">Xbox</a> -- $35 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&isPreview=1&asins=B0D71SHR5B,B0D71JQXR4,B0D71HX7PY&tag=gamespot-promos-20"">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                                                      <div>                        <a href=""https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https://www.walmart.com/search?q=Dragon+Quest+III&subId1=subid_value"">See at Walmart</a>           </div>                                                                                                             <div>                        <a href=""https://goto.target.com/c/1804712/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fs%3FsearchTerm%3DDragon%2BQuest%2BIII&partnerpropertyid=1423009"">See at Target</a>           </div>                                    </div>      </div>                                                                     <div class=""js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container"">             <h2 class=""item-title"">                    <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Quest-Illustrations-30th-Anniversary/dp/1974703908?ie=UTF8&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Dragon Quest Illustrations by Akira Toriyama</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=""item-deck"">                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Quest-Illustrations-30th-Anniversary/dp/1974703908?ie=UTF8&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&tag=gamespot-promos-20"">$17.68 (was $35)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=""image-container"">                                  <img class=""main-image"" src=https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1595/15950357/4593599-dragonquestillustrations.png>                             <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Quest-Illustrations-30th-Anniversary/dp/1974703908?ie=UTF8&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&tag=gamespot-promos-20""></a>                        </div>              <div class=""item-description""><p>If you don't own it, we'd highly recommend this lovely Dragon Quest art book.

Based on the iconic light freighter's appearance in Episode IV: A New Hope, this well-designed display model measures 9.5 x 7.5 x 5 inches and comes with an adjustable display stand that lets you pose the ship at different angles. A nameplate attaches to the front of the stand, and the 25th Anniversary logo brick featuring R2-D2 connects to the stand's base.</p><p>The Millennium Falcon is one six Lego Star Wars midi-scale ships released so far. Lego's midi-scale ships are designed for adults and experienced builders due to the number of small pieces and densely packed details. All of the mid-scale ships are priced under $100, but the Millennium Falcon offers the best value--even at full price--from a piece to price ratio.</p><p>The authentic design includes all of the exterior trappings found on the Millennium Falcon in the movies, including the rectenna dish, quad laser cannon, exhaust vents, the fuel lines, and more.

The Star Wars universe is rearranged when a reality-altering Jedi relic is moved. Heroes and villains swap allegiances, leading to characters such as Darth Jar Jar and Bounty Hunter C-3PO and reskinned starships like the Dark Falcon.</p><p>The 1,579-piece Dark Falcon playset has a number of interactive features, including spring-loaded shooters, rotating cannons, a removable cockpit, gunner post, and more.</p><p>The set includes six minifigures:</p><ul><li>Darth Jar Jar</li><li>Bounty Hunter C-3PO</li><li>Darth Dev</li><li>Darth Rey</li><li>Beach Luke</li><li>Jedi Vader</li></ul><p>All six minifigures have their own accessories, four of which are lightsabers. Notably, Darth Jar Jar, the galaxy's new Sith Lord, wields the double-sided red lightsaber that Darth Maul has in The Phantom Menace. There's even a removable throne for Darth Jar Jar. The gunner post and cockpit can fit two minifigures each.</p><p>The Dark Falcon building set is 17 x 12.5 x 5 inches. It's classified as a playset and is suitable for builders ages 10 and up, but it makes for a nice display piece. Plus, every Lego Star Wars minifigure collection is improved by Darth Jar Jar and Bounty Hunter C-3PO.</p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>

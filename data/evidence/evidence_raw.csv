New Game About Monster Politicians Somehow Less Evil Than The Real Thing,"<p>The Fractured Kingdom is holding an election in Cavalier Game Studios' new card-based roguelike Prime Monster. This nation has a three-party system that lets players choose between Viscount Sucksworth of the Vampiric Victory party, Orcs-4-U representative Chopper Badstone, and The Zombified People's Movement's prime shuffler, Rotilda De Cay. They're all monsters here, and there's no promise too outrageous for them to make in order to gain political power.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RttFYVPqbXU"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"" data-video-start=""1"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RttFYVPqbXU?start=1"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>The demo for Prime Monster is out now on <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/3214480/Prime_Monster/"">Steam</a>, and the cards let players unleash every dirty trick in the book. Murder isn't out of the question, but why kill your political opponent when you can smear their good name and ruin their reputation? Some fates are worse than death for these mostly dead creatures.</p><p>Cavalier Game Studios is going for political satire with some of the available initiatives, including calls for same-hex marriage and demands to release the nosferatu files. And rather than discouraging players from making false promises to the electorate, Prime Monster rewards them for lying. The more outlandish the promise, the more likely it is to keep you in power. These voters are pretty gullible, and they don't seem to mind voting for the greater evil.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-game-about-monster-politicians-somehow-less-evil-than-the-real-thing/1100-6538329/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-21T12:22:39.222174

"PS5, Xbox Series X|S, And Switch 1 Sales Dropped In January For The US","<p>The newest sales data for the US video game industry has arrived, and one of the takeaways is that hardware sales continue to slide for all major platforms--except the Switch 2, it seems.</p><p>Circana's report for January 2026 sales in the US showed that spending on hardware rose by 16% year-over-year, jumping to $248 million for the month. This growth was achieved despite the PS5 seeing a 17% decline in spending, the Xbox Series X|S posting a 27% decline, and the original Switch falling even more dramatically by 79% compared to last year.</p><p>The Switch 2, it seems, was the savior for hardware spending in January 2026, and it did well enough to offset all of those declines. Despite that, the Switch 2 was actually January 2026's No. 2 top platform for unit and dollar sales. The PS5 was the No. 1 overall console platform in January 2026 by those metrics, even with its 17% year-over-year decline in sales.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-switch-1-sales-dropped-in-january-for-the-us/1100-6538327/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-21T12:22:39.222174

They include the high-profile new cast members, like the aforementioned Wilde and Starr alongside Ellen Thomas (EastEnders) and Amelia Tyler (Baldur's Gate 3).</p><p>The visuals have also been radically improved, with the game now using Unreal Engine 5.

Nioh 3 Sees Best Start Yet For Team Ninja Series,"<p dir=""ltr"">Just two weeks after launching, Nioh 3 has already sold over 1 million copies globally. That makes the action-RPG the ""fastest-selling entry in the series' history,"" according to <a href=""https://teamninja-studio.com/nioh3/us/news/20260220.html"">the Team Ninja website</a>. Of note, the game achieved the sales milestone while only releasing on PS5 and PC, too.</p><p dir=""ltr"">On top of that, Team Ninja revealed that the entire franchise has now surpassed 10 million copies sold. The series started in February 2017 with Nioh on PS4, followed by a PC port later that year and a PS5 version in 2021. Nioh 2, which is actually a prequel, came along in 2020 for PS4, with a PS5 and PC release in 2021. The games have never been available on Xbox or Switch hardware. It's worth including that Sony published the first two Nioh games outside of Japan, too.</p><p dir=""ltr"">There is a chance that changes later this year. Earlier this month, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nioh-3-may-land-on-other-consoles-after-pc-and-ps5-new-trailer-shows/1100-6537827/"">a Nioh 3 trailer ended with specific language</a> stating that the game couldn't arrive on other consoles until six months after the February 6 launch on PS5. That leaves the door open for possible Xbox Series X|S and Switch 2 versions--especially considering Koei Tecmo is the worldwide publisher this time.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nioh-3-sees-best-start-yet-for-team-ninja-series/1100-6538316/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-21T12:22:39.222174
"Sony Terminated Fan-Made, Diablo-Like Bloodborne Project, Indie Dev Says","<p>Whenever Sony gets mentioned, there's somehow always an excuse to bring up Bloodborne, especially since a remake or remaster just doesn't seem likely anytime soon.

Ubisoft CEO Tries To Justify Mass Layoffs,"<p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has attempted to explain the company's recent push for a further €200 million ($235 million) in cost reductions, which has led to mass layoffs and a spate of game cancellations recently.</p><p><a href=""https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/"">Speaking to Variety</a>, Guillemot said the video game industry overall ""grew very quickly"" coming out of COVID, with people anticipating that the momentum for gaming generated during the pandemic would be sustained.

"Game Sales Grew In January 2026 in The US, But Mainly For One Reason Specifically","<p>The first 2026 data from Circana has landed, revealing how the video game industry fared in January 2026 and the year so far. One takeaway to consider is that software sales are growing, but not by much, and mainly fueled by spending on subscription services in a month that did not have many high-profile new releases.</p><p>Circana's US report said total spending on video game content in January 2026 rose by 3% year-over-year to $4.3 billion. This uptick was driven mainly by subscription spending, which rose by 23% year-over-year. Meanwhile, spending on console games and PC games only rose very modestly, at 2% and 1%, respectively. Additionally, spending on mobile games fell 1% during January 2026.</p><p>The Circana report did not single out any specific subscription services, but there are many in play currently. Some of them include Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation Plus, Nintendo Switch Online, Apple Arcade, Nvidia GeForce Now, EA Play, Game Club, Humble Bundle, Prime Gaming, and Ubisoft+, just to name a few.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-sales-grew-in-january-2026-in-the-us-but-mainly-for-one-reason-specifically/1100-6538313/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-21T12:22:39.222174
"Ubisoft Teases ""Several New IPs"" Are Coming Under New Structure","<p>As part of its plans to restructure the company, Ubisoft has established <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ubisoft-new-structure-explained-inside-the-publisher-five-creative-houses/2900-7420/"">Creative Houses</a> to focus on developing games across a wide variety of IP and genres. What does this mean in practise? In a new interview, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot explained how each Creative House isn't just a hub for video game development, but will also operate ""like dedicated business units"" that will be held accountable for performance and the development of new games.</p><p>""Each Creative House will have full responsibility for its brands’ development and its profit and loss (P&amp;L), including the development of new IP,"" Guillemot said to <a href=""https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/"">Variety</a>.

""We already have several new IPs in progress and look forward to sharing more soon,"" Guillemot said.</p><p>While Vantage Studios already has its own structure, legal framework, and governance as a subsidiary of Ubisoft, the ""appropriate model"" for the other Creative Houses is still being finalized.

"Game Publisher Claims TikTok Used AI To Alter Ads, Adding A Racist Stereotype","<p>Indie publisher Finji says TikTok used generative AI to alter its ads without permission—including one that inserted a racist, sexualized stereotype of a character from Usual June.

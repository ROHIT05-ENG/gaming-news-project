Its humour is pitch black, yes, and its comedic moments often dance on a knife's edge between laughter and revulsion, but writer and director Andrea Lucco Borlera's first-person narrative horror - his debut game, created in close collaboration with Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione - is a fascinatingly singular vision. It's singular enough, in fact, that it's not an easy thing to effectively describe, but if you can imagine a sort of thematic reinterpretation of Animal Farm by way of Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salo on one side, and a meme-able Garry's Mod video on the other, then Horses gleefully oscillates between them, landing somewhere in the middle.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-review"">Read more</a></p>",2025-12-04T17:22:01.649710

On the other, it is something new for the series, structurally most comparable not to other Metroid games but rather to a different Nintendo adventure franchise (more on that shortly). Then there is how the game is built, feeling almost modular, with different modes and moods of play stitched together with visible seams.

Battlefield 6's Winter Offensive Update Is All About Combat Consistency And Responsiveness,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/"">Battlefield 6</a> is getting a new update called Winter Offensive on December 9, bringing a handful of combat improvements focused on reliability, consistency, and responsiveness in the shooter's various modes.</p><p>Audio changes tested in a <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-testing-better-footstep-audio-hit-registration-in-short-notice-bf-labs-session/1100-6536613/"">recent Battlefield Labs mini-test</a> will be deployed with the upcoming update, with the overall aim to prioritize the most important combat and vehicle sounds. The audio refresh includes a ""comprehensive pass"" on footstep audio that aims to make footstep sound effects more tactically useful to players who can hear it. The update also includes some improvements towards ongoing performance issues that sometimes cause important sounds not to play as intended, an issue that's especially prevalent on large maps.</p><p>Rush and Breakthrough are also getting some balance changes designed to improve the game mode's flow, and even out the win rate between attacking and defending teams.

Elden Ring: Nightreign Adds New Patch Ahead Of The Forsaken Hollows DLC,"<p>This week, From Software's <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/"">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is expanding with The Forsaken Hollows DLC, which adds <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/videos/we-played-elden-ring-nightreigns-new-characters-for-6-hours/2300-6466558/"">two new playable characters</a>, two extra bosses, and a fresh Shifting Earth event. But if you want to play that DLC, then you'll need to add the new Nightreign Version 1.03 patch across PC and consoles.</p><p>One of the primary changes in this patch is that the trigger conditions for Relic effects have been broadened. The game's passive effects have been increased, which include greater attacking power when using two-handed weapons or armaments, as well as chain attacks, charge attacks, and jump attacks.</p><p>The Wrath of Gold incantation has been given a power boost, while decreasing the cost to players' FP consumption. There are a number of bug fixes in this patch as well, including one that was teleporting players to the wrong area during the Augur invasion if they were performing a critical hit at the time. Under certain conditions, players weren't able to activate Sites of Grace or Churches, but the notes say the issue has been ""mitigated.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-adds-new-patch-ahead-of-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc/1100-6536687/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-04T17:22:01.649710

For Samus fans, it's one of the few collectibles featuring the bounty hunter's regenerating Varia Suit. The blue-tinged sections on the suit are organic matter from the Fusion Suit. This directly ties back to the events of Metroid Fusion. In the 2002 Game Boy Advance game, Samus was infected by the X parasite. She received the Metroid vaccine, but when Dread starts, her Varia Suit is still in the process of regenerating to its normal form.</p><p>This Samus Amiibo is cool, but the E.M.M.I. Amiibo might be cooler. One of the most unsettling enemies in franchise history, the Extraplanetary Multiform Mobile Identifier--better known as EMMI--is robot nightmare fuel. Like Samus, the EMMI Amiibo's pose matches official key art.</p><p>If Amazon sells out, you can buy the Metroid Dread 2-Pack from a third-party seller on Walmart Marketplace for roughly the same price.</p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a

And now that it's possible to really escape from Tarkov, someone's done it and shared the video to prove it.</p><p>A streamer who goes by Tigz has been acknowledged by Battlestate Games as the first player to find a way out of Tarkov in this first-person-extraction shooter.

"Skyblivion Is Delayed To 2026, But It Already Looks Very Good","<p>The dream of <a href=""https://skyblivion.com"">Skyblivion</a> goes back over a decade as a team of fans came together to use <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/"">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's</a> engine to fully recreate and re-imagine <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/"">Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> as a modern RPG. At the beginning of 2023, the team set <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-skyblivion-mod-to-release-by-2025/1100-6510685/"">a 2025 premiere for Skyblivion</a>. However, that's no longer the plan and Skyblivion has been pushed to next year. The good news is that the latest dev video shows off how much has been finished and what remains to be done.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC6W0htYBOc"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yC6W0htYBOc"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Skyblivion lead Rebelzize narrates the video as he offers a guide to where things stand. According to Rebelzize, most of the work has already been done and over 70 volunteer contributors are still hard at work trying to get the ambitious mod across the finish line.</p><p>When this project was started, The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion was far out of date. Earlier this year, Bethesda released Oblivion Remastered, which could have taken the wind out of this team's project. Instead, Rebelzize and others praised the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-official-oblivion-remastered-release-skyblivion-mod-dev-says-its-a-win-win/1100-6530951/"">remaster as a ""win-win"" for the community</a>.

Game With Amazing Premise Has Been Canceled,"<p>Legendary game designer and programmer Ron Gilbert (Monkey Island) has revealed that one of his exciting-sounding upcoming projects has been canceled due in part to investors not coming to the table to fund the project.</p><p><a href=""https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/after-40-years-of-adventure-games-ron-gilbert-pivots-to-outrunning-death/"">Speaking to Ars Technica</a>, Gilbert said this game had a vision of being a ""large, open-world-type RPG"" in the vein of The Legend of Zelda. Gilbert worked alongside two other people--an artist and a designer--for about a year on the project before Gilbert realized it was not going to happen.</p><p>""I just [didn't] have the money or the time to build a big open-world game like that,"" he said. ""You know, it's either a passion project you spent 10 years on, or you just need a bunch of money to be able to hire people and resources.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-with-amazing-premise-has-been-canceled/1100-6536678/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-04T17:22:01.649710

"Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Players, Be Sure To Do This Before Entering Endgame","<p dir=""ltr"">Getting 100% completion in a Metroid game--and metroidvania titles in general--is a satisfying achievement that's part of the genre's appeal. However, in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, there is unfortunately a way to pigeonhole yourself where collecting everything needed isn't possible. Now, the game will warn you about a point of no return, but it's still easy to make a regrettable decision. That's why GameSpot's reviewer for the first-person adventure, Steve Watts, advises players to make a copy of their main save in another save slot before entering the endgame.</p><p> </p><p dir=""ltr"">Watts detailed the ""confusing choice"" that Nintendo and developer Retro Studios made in his <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review-prime-but-not-quite-prime-prime/1900-6418446/"">Metroid Prime 4 review</a>. ""When I was ready to proceed to the endgame, I got the usual warnings about a point of no return, but I had figured I could always load an older save to go back and do more exploring to pick up power-ups that I missed,"" Watts wrote. ""But the auto-save now has me locked into the final area with no such apparent option, and my regular save slot--the one that activates when Samus steps into a save station--has been overwritten with a Mission Complete, so loading it prompts me to start a new game.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-players-be-sure-to-do-this-before-entering-endgame/1100-6536679/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-04T17:22:01.649710

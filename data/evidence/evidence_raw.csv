It has been finding a way to bring old classics back since it began operating 17 years ago. But in that time things have changed. New games released during that period became modern classics in their own right and found their way onto GOG, and the company's remit slightly widened. And as time marches forward again, a new challenge in game preservation has emerged - the question of how we save or resurrect fallen multiplayer games.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-weighs-complicated-riddle-of-multiplayer-game-preservation"">Read more</a></p>",2026-01-16T00:54:58.160114

What would the great Russian novel look like as a video game? If Dostoyevsky or Gogol had lived to dabble in Unity, what would be the result? The answer might well be Pathologic 3; or, to be more precise, the series of Pathologic games, since their daunting individual thematic and narrative complexity is in part a consequence of how they stand in relation to one another.

It doesn't sound like much of an ask, but it really is, trust me. I needed a Christmas Golden Goose, something I could tap into whenever family harmony started to teeter towards a level of chaos no amount of Cadbury's Heroes could remedy - while the Bluey scavenger hunt game is good, it definitely skews more four-year-old, and traditional video games were off the menu. In my festive hour of need, as if sent by Santa himself, Netflix provided. Yes, Netflix.

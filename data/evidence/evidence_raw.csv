Depending on the device, the headset can connect via 2.4GHz and/or Bluetooth.

You can also use it as wired headset with the detachable 3.5mm audio cable.</p><p>The 50mm titanium-plated drivers produce 24-bit/96kHz high-resolution audio. The headset supports 7.1 surround sound and is compatible with console-specific features such as the PS5's Tempest 3D Audio. For game chat, the Delta II has a detachable 10mm boom microphone.</p><p>The plush D-shaped earcups and headband are wrapped in leatherette and have memory foam cushions. The headset has a lightweight but sturdy frame and weighs only 318g (0.70lbs) overall.</p><p>The ROG Delta II offers incredible battery life of up to 110 hours over 2.4GHz and up to 140 hours with Bluetooth. Just keep in mind battery life drops to roughly 27 hours if the RGB lighting effects are active.

Someone Dressed Up As Pac-Man To Play Pac-Man During AGDQ Livestream,"<p>Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ), a bi-annual charity livestream, kicked off this week with an assortment of speedrunners playing new and old games, from <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/jet-set-radio-2000/"">Jet Set Radio</a> to <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers/"">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>. A wacky event that tends to attract all sorts of characters, someone made a surprise appearance during AGDQ on January 5: Pac-Man, who played <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/pac-man-world-2/"">Pac-Man World 2</a>.</p><p>Well, it wasn't really Pac-Man. The day started with speedruns of games like <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-x/"">Final Fantasy X</a>, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/mega-man-battle-network/"">Mega Man Battle Network</a>, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/nuclear-throne/"">Nuclear Throne</a>, and <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/wolfenstein-the-old-blood/"">Wolfenstein: The Old Blood</a>. As the multi-hour livestream went on, the event's organizers booted up Pac-Man World 2 for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/"">Minecraft</a> content creator DThaiPome to play. If the event raised $10,000, then Pac-Man--really, DThaiPome in a blow-up Pac-Man costume--would speedrun his own game. That fundraising goal was easily crushed, and DThaiPome, in a Pac-Man outfit, played some Pac-Man.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wl0fD-h9mM"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2wl0fD-h9mM"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Playing a remastered version of the classic 2002 platformer, DThaiPome managed to beat Pac-Man World 2 in approximately 30 minutes, employing all kinds of skips and tricks to get to the end as quickly as possible.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/someone-dressed-up-as-pac-man-to-play-pac-man-during-agdq-livestream/1100-6537187/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-06T00:53:59.407508

Like the dreamcatchers quest in the game, players can shoot the webs and get them to release a feather.

Steam Smashes New Concurrent-User Record With More Than 41 Million Online,"<p>Steam hit a major milestone already this year, setting a new record for concurrent users. According to SteamDB, the platform peaked at <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/charts/"">41,816,052 users online at the same time</a> actively playing games. Not only that, but a new record for actively gaming users was also set, with that figure reaching <a href=""https://mein-mmo.de/en/steam-starts-in-2026-in-the-best-way-already-breaking-a-record-after-4-days,1544545/"">almost 13.4 million</a> as compared to March's 13.2 million record.</p><p>The timing of the record is likely no coincidence.<a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-steam-winter-sale-2025-game-deals/2900-7360/""> Steam's annual Winter Sale</a>, which wraps up later today, offered steep discounts on a wide range of popular titles, along with more modest deals on newer releases. Sales events have long been a reliable driver of traffic on Steam, pulling in both longtime users and players returning to pick up games they missed throughout the year.</p><p>Steam's growth has been steady for well over a decade, but it has accelerated sharply in recent years. A notable spike occurred in early 2020, when COVID-19 lockdowns pushed concurrent users past 23 million, later climbing to <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-passes-28-million-concurrent-users-setting-new-record/1100-6499464/"">28 million just a couple of years later</a>. The company even offered a bundle of games, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-covid-19-bundle-has-4-fantastic-indie-games-/1100-6475753/"">which went to COVID relief at the time</a>. Since then, the rise of live-service games and consistently strong seasonal sales have helped keep players logged in, especially during holidays.

Arc Raiders Player Screaming For Help Gets Frantic Visit From Real-Life Neighbor,"<p>Sometimes you get so into a game that you scream uncontrollably. Whether that be a curse word or an SOS, if you yell loud enough, someone will come to your rescue. At least that's what happened to one <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a> player, whose door was kicked in by a concerned neighbor after he heard the player yelling for help.</p><p>Redditor dreamthorp <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/ARC_Raiders/comments/1q35psm/neighbor_heard_me_yelling_help_in_arc_raiders/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"">posted a 16-second clip of the incident</a> on the Arc Raiders subreddit on January 3. They said they were playing a night raid on the Dam Battlegrounds, the game's very first map. While trying to extract from an elevator, a Leaper reportedly pounced on and downed them before the elevator doors shut. ""I just wanted to get stabilized so I could leave,"" dreamthorp said in the comments of their Reddit post. It's at this point that they started screaming, ""Somebody help me.""</p><p>Well, somebody did come to help. As displayed on the door's Ring camera, a concerned neighbor walked over, knocked, and asked if they were ""all good."" Dreamthorp screamed for help again, at which point the concerned neighbor--a firefighter, according to dreamthorp--stepped back, assumed a stance, and kicked the door in, an action that allegedly corrupted the Ring camera's file.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-player-screaming-for-help-gets-frantic-visit-from-real-life-neighbor/1100-6537173/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-06T00:53:59.407508
"It's The Final Countdown For Anthem, With Only One Week Left To Play","<p dir=""ltr"">Time is running out to play Anthem, BioWare's live-service game that originally launched in early 2019. In just one week, EA will take the online-multiplayer game offline, meaning it won't be playable starting January 12.</p><p dir=""ltr"">EA officially announced that <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-anthem-shutting-down-entirely-will-be-unplayable-starting-next-year/1100-6532956/"">Anthem would be shut down</a> in July 2025. This gave players roughly half-a-year to return to the RPG and to spend any leftover currency they had for the title. <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/anthems-end-is-nearly-here"">Eurogamer</a> is looking at whether any sort of in-game event is planned to make the occasion, but that seems very unlikely at this point.</p><p dir=""ltr"">After that announcement, former BioWare producer Mark Darrah <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bioware-producer-details-what-went-wrong-with-anthem/1100-6533735/"">discussed what went wrong with Anthem</a>--at least from his point of view.

Hudson is now overseeing the team that's working on <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-is-probably-many-years-away-from-release/1100-6536942/"">the recently revealed Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/its-the-final-countdown-for-anthem-with-only-one-week-left-to-play/1100-6537170/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-06T00:53:59.407508
Code Vein II Tells A Time-Traveling Story That Will Tug On Your Heartstrings,"<p dir=""ltr"">The souls-like genre has exploded in popularity since the dawn of From Software's Souls franchise, with multiple companies taking a stab at the format--and some companies taking multiple stabs. Bandai Namco, who publishes FromSoft's Souls games as well as Elden Ring, dropped an anime-style version of the genre in 2019's Code Vein, and now it's back for more in Code Vein II.</p><p dir=""ltr"">We spent a few hours with the next Code Vein adventure during The Game Awards week, and we came away impressed with its improved combat system and a new and interesting take on the genre's ""summon"" mechanic, but what surprised us most was an original story that carries some emotional weight. The original Code Vein was a solid first effort, but Code Vein II shows that the franchise may have, pardon the pun, cracked the code.</p><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629230-pylon_exploration1.png"" data-ref-id=""1300-4629230"" data-ratio=""0.5625"" data-width=""3840"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 3840px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629230-pylon_exploration1.png""><img alt=""Code Vein II"" src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4629230-pylon_exploration1.png"" srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629230-pylon_exploration1.png 3840w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4629230-pylon_exploration1.png 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/37852/4629230-pylon_exploration1.png 480w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"" data-width=""1280""></a><figcaption>Code Vein II</figcaption></figure><h2 dir=""ltr"">A new code</h2><p dir=""ltr"">Code Vein II takes place in a world on the edge of ruin, and where humans and Revenants, a human-like species of beings with vampiric abilities, live amongst one another.

The shell's distinct shade of classic Nintendo gray is complemented by colorful buttons. Here's the list of inputs on the 8BitDo 64 Controller:</p><ul><li>Hall Effect Control Stick (Light Gray)</li><li>D-pad (Dark Gray)</li><li>A button (Blue)</li><li>B button (Green)</li><li>C-pad (Yellow)</li><li>Start button (Red)</li><li>L/R shoulder buttons (Dark Gray)</li><li>L/R Z triggers (Dark Gray)</li><li>Select / Star / Home (Light Gray)</li></ul><p>A switch on the back of the controller toggles between S-Input for Switch 1/2 and D-Input for everything else, including Analogue 3D. With the 8BitDo Ultimate Software V2 desktop or mobile app, you can fully remap the controls and make other adjustments.</p><p>The 8BitDo 64 connects wirelessly via Bluetooth LE (Low Energy) or Bluetooth 5.0. The Analogue 3D and some newer Android phones support Bluetooth LE, so battery life is a bit better when gaming on those devices. The 8BitDo 64 can run for up to 36 hours between charges when connected via Bluetooth LE. On Switch 1/2, that number is closer to 30 hours, in our experience, which is still impressive.</p><p>You can also use the 8BitDo 64 as a wired controller with the detachable USB-C to USB-A charging cable. Instead of the bulky N64 Rumble Pak, the 8BitDo 64 has built-in rumble motors. Vibration only works on Analogue 3D and when playing N64 games in the Nintendo Switch Online app on Switch 1/2.</p><p>Outside of the color scheme, the new gray model is identical to the white and black editions, so the features outlined below apply to all three colors.</p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LG0I9ZQ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20"">Preorder at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>   </div> </div><div title=""6527185 - 8BitDo 64 Controller preorders"" data-embed-type=""buylink"" data-ref-id=""2747"" data-template=""4"" data-size=""buylink__listicle"" data-title=""6527185 - 8BitDo 64 Controller preorders"" data-collection="""" class=""norewrite"">  <div class=""buylink-container"">                                                                     <div class=""js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container"">             <h2 class=""item-title"">                    <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&isPreview=1&asins=B0DK6VCGBC,B0DKX7JZQD,B0FKMR28SS,B0FKT9DM4W,B0FMR641HP&tag=gamespot-promos-20"">8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=""item-deck"">                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&isPreview=1&asins=B0DK6VCGBC,B0DKX7JZQD,B0FKMR28SS,B0FKT9DM4W,B0FMR641HP&tag=gamespot-promos-20"">$40</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=""image-container"">                                  <img class=""main-image"" src=https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1595/15950357/4387969-analoguecontroller.jpg>                             <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&isPreview=1&asins=B0DK6VCGBC,B0DKX7JZQD,B0FKMR28SS,B0FKT9DM4W,B0FMR641HP&tag=gamespot-promos-20""></a>                        </div>              <div class=""item-description""><p>The 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller has a contemporary form factor like the manufacturer's <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCRDGP4,B0DRCVGJJW,B0F4R2GNK7,B0FJ89XD8N,B0FJ89SN3T,B0F194QFT2,B0F2H6VKP8,B0F53LPKPW,B0F5361M91,B0F535W7JZ,B0F4R312M3,B0F532P7CK,B0FB93DLMM,B0FBRJSFNT,B0FB88JHK3,B0FB8WGG6L&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Ultimate Controller series</a> and the official <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F3VTFD6J,B0FY94LCPK,B01NAWKYZ0&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Switch 1/2 Pro Controllers</a>. </p><p>8BitDo retained the unique aspects of the original joystick while upgrading the tech and ergonomics. The joystick is repositioned to the left side of the controller, and while the cap has the trio of circular ridges, the rubberized texture is much kinder to your thumb than the N64 controller's plastic surface. Just like the original, the 8BitDo 64 has an octagonal stick gate, which Nintendo included to mimic an eight-way D-pad. The stick is activated with a Hall Effect sensor (anti-drift) and has a wear-resistant metal ring.</p><p>The classic four-way D-pad still sits in a recessed pocket, while the large A/B buttons and C-pad match the original layout. The R/L shoulder buttons are chunkier and offer better feedback. The N64's Z button, which was located on the back of the middle prong, is replaced with two conventional Z triggers behind the shoulder buttons. The dual triggers are helpful if you want to use the controller for games outside of the N64 library.</p><p>The N64's big Start button returns and is joined by three buttons found on many 8BitDo Switch controllers: Minus (select), 8BitDo (home), and Star/Turbo. With standard turbo activated, your game will register holding a button down as repeated taps. There's also an auto-turbo mode that spams the programmed input without needing to press the button at all. </p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&isPreview=1&asins=B0DK6VCGBC,B0DKX7JZQD,B0FKMR28SS,B0FKT9DM4W,B0FMR641HP&tag=gamespot-promos-20"">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>   </div> </div><p>If you have trouble syncing the 8BitDo 64 to Switch 2 or Analogue 3D, make sure <a href=""https://support.8bitdo.com/firmware-updater.html"">the controller is updated to the latest firmware</a>.

The new cooperative format for 2-4 players includes four 60-card Turtle decks, a 39-card deck featuring Shredder and other villains, and four Play Booster Packs. You're getting a total of 335 cards for $50. Four Play Booster Packs on their own would cost you $28, so you're only paying $22 for the rest.</p><h2>TMNT Magic: The Gathering Set</h2><ul><li><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Gathering-Teenage-Turtles-Collectible/dp/B0FR6W5K12?tag=gamespot-preorders-20"">TMNT Play Booster Box</a> -- $160 (<del>$209.70</del>)</li><li><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Gathering-Teenage-Turtles-Collectible/dp/B0FR7JTZT5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20"">TMNT Draft Night</a> -- $130</li><li><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Gathering-Teenage-Commander-Collectible/dp/B0FR717633?tag=gamespot-preorders-20"">TMNT Commander Deck</a> -- $70</li><li><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Gathering-Exclusive-Accessories-Collectible/dp/B0FR7KFXBB?tag=gamespot-preorders-20"">TMNT Bundle</a> -- $70</li><li><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Gathering-Teenage-Turtles-Collectible/dp/B0FR7G52PN?tag=gamespot-preorders-20"">TMNT Pizza Bundle</a> -- $100</li><li><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Gathering-Teenage-Turtles-Collectible/dp/B0FR7K693P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20"">TMNT Turtle Team-Up</a> -- $50</li><li><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Gathering-Teenage-Collector-Collectible/dp/B0FR6HPWJB?tag=gamespot-preorders-20"">TMNT Collector Booster</a> -- $38</li><li><a href=""https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F614286%2F10014%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fproduct%252Fwizards-of-the-coast-magic-the-gathering--teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-collector-booster-box-12-packs%252FJJ8VP7WWC5%26partnerpropertyid%3D1423009&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Ffeeds%2Fnews%2Ftags%2Frockstar-games&event_type=click"">TMNT Collector Booster Box</a> -- $450</li><li><a href=""https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F614286%2F10014%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fproduct%252Fwizards-of-the-coast-magic-the-gathering--teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tin-styles-may-vary%252FJJ8VP7WZGC%26partnerpropertyid%3D1423009&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Ffeeds%2Fnews%2Ftags%2Frockstar-games&event_type=click"">TMNT Play Booster Tins (5 Variants)</a> -- $21</li><li><a href=""https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F614286%2F10014%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fproduct%252Fwizards-of-the-coast-magic-the-gathering--teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-play-booster-sleeve%252FJJ8VP7WWGK%26partnerpropertyid%3D1423009&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Ffeeds%2Fnews%2Ftags%2Frockstar-games&event_type=click"">TMNT Play Booster</a> -- $7</li></ul><div title=""[MTG] Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles x Magic: The Gathering Full Set"" data-embed-type=""buylink"" data-ref-id=""4671"" data-template=""4"" data-size=""buylink__listicle"" data-title=""[MTG] Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles x Magic: The Gathering Full Set"" data-collection="""" class=""norewrite"">  <div class=""buylink-container"">                                                                     <div class=""js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container"">             <h2 class=""item-title"">                    <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Gathering-Teenage-Turtles-Collectible/dp/B0FR6W5K12?tag=gamespot-preorders-20"">TMNT Play Booster Box</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=""item-deck"">                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Gathering-Teenage-Turtles-Collectible/dp/B0FR6W5K12?tag=gamespot-preorders-20"">$160 (was $209.70)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=""image-container"">                                  <img class=""main-image"" src=https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1595/15950357/4583255-tmntplayboosterbox.png>                             <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Gathering-Teenage-Turtles-Collectible/dp/B0FR6W5K12?tag=gamespot-preorders-20""></a>                        </div>              <div class=""item-description""><p>The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Play Booster Box comes with 30 packs containing 14 cards and a non-foil double-sided token.

But that's not all there is to care about in Fortnite's latest update--we've also got a pair of new sets of quests that reward XP, and an additional free cosmetic that must be earned by completing a specific one of those new quests. Let's take a look at what we've got here.</p><p>Not all of the Winterfest quests are currently available. As of December 20, only the first two sets of quests are available. </p><div data-embed-type=""toc""><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a href=""https://www.gamespot.com"">hide</a>]</span><ul id=""toc_list"" class=""collapse in""><li><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com"">Winterfest 2025 quests</a></li></ul></div><h2 id=""Winterfest_2025_quests"">Winterfest 2025 quests</h2><p>The first of these new quests sets, listed under Winterfest in your quest log, are for Battle Royale. There are four time-gated groups of this set of quests--the first group is available now, and the rest will be added periodically. Completing a quest awards 12K XP each, and there may be a reward at the end of the questline--but we don't know for sure yet. These quests expire when Winterfest ends on January 5.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-winterfest-2025-all-quests-and-rewards/1100-6537092/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-23T12:21:28.085210

The box set includes theatrical, special edition, and extended cuts of Avatar in 4K, as well as standard Blu-ray and a digital streaming copy of the film. What makes this edition special is that it includes hours of exclusive special features, ranging from deleted scenes to an in-depth deconstruction of how several major moments from the movie were created and filmed.</p><p>Additionally, there's a behind-the-scenes presentation by famed filmmaker Jon Landau, RDA promos featuring Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch, and several featurettes examining the script, artwork, and marketing of Avatar.

The saga follows Jake Sully, a human whose mind is transferred into a genetically engineered Na'vi body on a mission to infiltrate and sabotage their resistance. However, Sully quickly finds himself won over by the Na'vi, and joins their side to push back the invading human forces.</p><p>The first two films in the series, Avatar and Avatar: The Way of Water are some of the most successful movies in recent history. The two films combined have grossed over $5.2 billion at the box office, and the third film, Avatar: Fire and Ash, premiered on December 19 to positive reviews and an equally strong $345 million global box office opening weekend.

"Expedition 33 Studio Won't Scale Up For Next Project, Even Though It Can","<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was one of 2025's biggest breakout hits, and the game's commercial success has afforded developer Sandfall Interactive the opportunity to scale up for its next project. However, the company is not going to do that--and for what sounds like a good reason.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=""https://newsletter.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=99B77395-C1C6-4F52-AF3E-415FC009F6B1&amp;sid=7C18806E-AF5A-4F78-A29B-F02783429FF1"">Edge</a>, studio boss Guillaume Broche said he does not feel tempted to grow the company in the wake of the success of Expedition 33, which was the studio's debut title. Why not? He said (<a href=""https://www.gamesindustry.biz/clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-sandfall-says-expansion-isnt-tempting"">via GI.biz</a>), ""I think it's good to have limitations when you are creative.""</p><p>""It's the best way to be the best version of yourself. We could scale up now we have a lot more money, but I would say it's not tempting for us, because even the management team and myself, we'd have to be hands-on and doing things for ourselves,"" he said. ""We love making games more than we love managing, so we want to keep doing that. These past five years were some of the best of my life, and I want to be happy like that again.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-studio-wont-scale-up-for-next-project-even-though-it-can/1100-6537141/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-23T12:21:28.085210

"Arc Raiders Is My Game Of The Year, But Its Use Of Generative AI Really Sucks","<p dir=""ltr"">These past two months with Arc Raiders have been the most fun I've had with games all year. It represents the most exciting and unpredictable multiplayer landscape I've jumped into since Sea of Thieves in 2018, which I consider my favorite game ever made. It's safe to say I really love Arc Raiders. But it's become difficult to fully espouse those feelings as we learn about Embark Studio's use of generative AI.</p><p dir=""ltr"">According to the studio, Arc Raiders' voice acting was initially performed by humans, then used to ""train"" AI so that it could speak in the actors' voices while addressing any possible circumstance. For Embark, the team doesn't need to bring in the voice actors each time new content is added to the game. The AI voices learn to speak in the voices of the actors, which the actors are said to have agreed upon when they were hired, and the tools take it from there. Maybe it shouldn't have come as a surprise, since the team's previous game, The Finals, uses generative AI in a similar way. In an <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use"">interview</a>, Embark assured players that the game's visual artwork is entirely human-made, but admitted to using this text-to-speech training to bring voices to the game's shop NPCs, emotes, and other character barks. Knowing this has left me conflicted when I think to sing the game's praises.</p><p dir=""ltr"">On one hand, I can't deny the hold Arc Raiders has taken over me. The heart wants what the heart wants, and Embark's extraction shooter, rich in emergent, player-driven drama, has lit my heart on fire in a way few games ever have. At the same time, I've already written <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arc-raiders-review-us-against-the-world/1900-6418435/"">my review</a>. Though it was a glowing one that I don't regret, I also feel it's my job to call out this disappointing practice. In recent weeks, similar practices or plans have arisen in several high-profile examples. <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/"">Larian Studios' boss vouched</a> for it in some cases. Nexon's former CEO said <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-nexon-ceo-says-aaa-games-are-in-end-of-days-and-ai-is-about-to-rewrite-everything/1100-6536651/"">AI is about to rewrite everything</a> in the games industry.

Expedition 33 Actor Says The Game Awards Best Performance Award Doesn't Credit Everyone,"<p>The actor who provided the motion capture for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's Gustave has spoken out to say it would be ""more logical"" to have a Best Character category at awards shows to help give credit to everyone who contributed to bringing a character to life in a game.

There are also more traditional shooters like Contracts Shadow: ExfilZone. Fans of dark fantasy dungeon crawls should check out Amid Evil VR, which offers a frantic melee adventure with classic Quake-style movement and level design.</p><p>For something more strategic, check out Neon Squad Tactics. The top-down, turn-based, cyberpunk tactics game lets players choose from nine unique characters and fight across 31 maps. Meanwhile, 7th Guest VR and Shadow Chambers are great picks for more immersive, puzzle-filled adventure games.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fanatical-build-your-own-quest-vr-bundle/1100-6537134/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-23T12:21:28.085210

"Paramount Sweetens Its Offer For Warner Bros., Including Massive Guarantee From Larry Ellison","<p>Despite Netflix announcing a deal with Warner Bros. Discovery to acquire the media and entertainment behemoth, Paramount has not given up on its own attempt to acquire the company by going directly to shareholders. Now, Paramount has announced that it has further sweetened its proposal in a bid to make a deal.</p><p>Paramount, which is run by David Ellison, has offered an ""irrevocable personal guarantee"" from his father, billionaire Oracle founder Larry Ellison, of $40.4 billion. Additionally, Paramount announced that it would increase and match Netflix's fee of $5.8 billion to be paid to WBD if the deal gets struck down in the regulatory process. Paramount's previous breakup fee was $5 billion.</p><p>What's more, Paramount said its revised proposal includes ""further improved flexibility to WBD on debt refinancing transactions, representations, and interim operating covenants."" The updated offer also includes the publishing of records that show the Ellison family trust owns 1.16 billion shares of Oracle stock, which is an attempt to show WBD shareholders that the Ellisons can indeed finance their $40.4 billion of the proposed $108 billion all-cash offer.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paramount-sweetens-its-offer-for-warner-bros-including-massive-guarantee-from-larry-ellison/1100-6537130/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-23T12:21:28.085210

Once again, the cursed Necronomicon features prominently in a tale about estranged sisters, giving rise to flesh-possessing demons and forcing one family to take on the most nightmarish version of motherhood imaginable.</p><p>If you don't feel like waiting for the new Arrow Video version of Evil Dead: Rise, you can pick up the older Blu-rays from Amazon. It's worth noting that the 4K and standard Blu-rays come with no special features whatsoever, but if you want the movies on their own, these are cheap alternatives.

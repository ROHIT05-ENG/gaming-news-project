"In 2025, Deltarune reminded me of the joy and importance of secret hunting","<img src=""https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/deltarune_3QgaoNa.jpg?width=690&quality=85&format=jpg&auto=webp"" /> <p>A guide writer talking about how her favourite gaming related moment of 2025 was uncovering secrets? Who saw that coming&hellip; Seriously though, let me tell you about a little downside of my job: if we're covering a game, or considering doing so, I have to spoil everything for myself for planning purposes. End-game boss? Spoiled. Every collectible location and what happens after you've collected every magic hat or whatever? Spoiled. Plot twists, because I might as well go all in at this point? Spoiled. If I don't learn it before the game comes out, I'll certainly know about it shortly after release thanks to research. (I learned what happened to Zelda in <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343"">Tears of the Kingdom</a> via Google Trends. <em>Google bloody Trends</em>.)</p> <p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/in-2025-deltarune-reminded-me-of-the-joy-and-importance-of-secret-hunting"">Read more</a></p>",2026-01-10T12:18:55.479653
Skin Deep was this year's reminder that it's a privilege to recognise a developer's handwriting,"<img src=""https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/skin-deep-eoy-header.png?width=690&quality=85&format=jpg&auto=webp"" /> <p>Out in space there are objects that orbit one another for so long, and at such a stately pace, that when they both eventually arrive at the same point, they don't collide with some kind of awful explosion. Instead, they just touch. They graze. They fuse. It's all very gentle. And then, over time, the two objects become one.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2025-skin-deep"">Read more</a></p>",2026-01-10T12:18:55.479653
"In 2025, Winter Burrow showed how a little kindness goes a long way","<img src=""https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/winter-burrow_PFDTmok.jpg?width=690&quality=85&format=jpg&auto=webp"" /> <p>In a loud world where everyone is battling to be heard, it's easy to forget that the quiet and smaller moments of kindness hold the most power. A lot of the time, it's easy to think that keeping to yourself is the easiest way to deal with things, whether you're dealing with your own pain or trying to find the right way to navigate someone else's. It's never easy to know what to do, we're all trying our best - after all this is all our first time being human. But one truth remains:a little kindness goes a long way. Winter Burrow, the intrepid little mouse game, shows this more than anything else I've played in 2025.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/in-2025-winter-burrow-showed-how-a-little-kindness-goes-a-long-way"">Read more</a></p>",2026-01-10T12:18:55.479653

Eurogamer's Alternate Game Awards 2025,"<img src=""https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Alt-awards-header.jpg?width=690&quality=85&format=jpg&auto=webp"" /> <p>The year is over! Or near enough.

This might be the only time on Eurogamer I can get away with using the old cliche 'mixed bag', hey. As everyone else is putting their minds together to come up with awards in a range of arbitrary categories, we thought it was only right that we did the same in celebration of this strange old year and some of the great, funny, wild, stupid, and bad things that have happened in it - with our tongue firmly planted in our cheek.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamers-alternate-game-awards-2025"">Read more</a></p>",2026-01-10T12:18:55.479653

I won't deny that it was once a game I was embarrassed to be playing. But now? I'm all in, dude. I'm an English 27-year-old who is invested in Japanese horse racing.

The 1,201 piece model is based on Gandalf the Grey's battle with Durin's Bane in the movie adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring.</p><p>Once fully built, the frame resembles the stone pillars and archways of the First and Second Halls in the Mines of Moria. The buildable stand for the Gandalf the Grey minifigure represents the narrowest point on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm.</p><p>With the Book Nook closed, as shown above, the model is 5.5 x 6.5 x 9 inches and captures the moment Gandalf confidently blocks the Balrog's path and exclaims, ""You shall not pass!"" The memorable line of dialogue is quoted on the Book Nook's front plaque. Lego Gandalf wields his signature staff in one hand and Glamdring (his sword) in the other.</p><p>The buildable Balrog figure is essentially an articulated action figure, because you can pose his wings, arms, hands, legs, and fingers. Balrog comes with a whip accessory, and flame elements attach to his back. Lego used flexible sheets of translucent plastic to make the wings. It's only been included with one other Lego set: the 269-piece Fell Beast, which was a purchase bonus Lego Insiders when the massive Barad-dûr building set launched in 2024.</p><p>You can disconnect the bridge from each side to open the Book Nook. This alternate display mode showcases the Balrog's imposing presence with its wings fully unfurled. Flame elements decorate the left and right archways, which is a reference to the Balrog of Moria's ability to start a fire by flapping its wings.</p><p>With the Book Nook fully unfolded, the wider model is 17.5 x 6.5 x 9 inches. Since neither the Balrog figure or Gandalf minifigure need to be connected to the frame, you can display them without the Lego Book Nook, too.</p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRW56MKL?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>   </div> </div><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4633308-legolordoftheringsbooknookimage.png"" data-ref-id=""1300-4633308"" data-ratio=""0.563"" data-width=""1000"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 1000px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4633308-legolordoftheringsbooknookimage.png""><img alt=""Lego Icons: The Lord of the Rings -

"RAM Shortages May Lead To More Expensive TVs And Devices, Warns Samsung","<p>The increasing demand for AI among tech companies is one of the reasons why the global shortage of memory chips remains an ongoing issue. And while it's expected to adversely affect the production of smartphones, Samsung Electronics co-CEO T M Roh has warned that TVs and home appliances may also be hit by shortages and increased prices.</p><p>""As this situation is unprecedented, no company is immune to its impact,"" said Roh via <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/world/china/samsung-double-mobile-devices-powered-by-googles-gemini-800-mln-units-this-year-2026-01-05/"">Reuters</a>. According to the report, Roh noted that TVs and home appliances will also feel the pinch from the shortages and he didn't rule out price hikes to compensate for them. Samsung is the biggest manufacturer of TVs in the world, and Roh said it the impact of the RAM shortages will be ""inevitable.""</p><p>The rise in consumer-electronic prices would also throw a large wrench in Microsoft's ongoing ""This Is an Xbox"" strategy, as smart TVs, including those made by Samsung, are among the growing list of platforms capable of playing Game Pass titles.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ram-shortages-may-lead-to-more-expensive-tvs-and-devices-warns-samsung/1100-6537306/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-10T12:18:55.479653

"Sims Team Says ""Values Are Unchanged"" Ahead Of Potential Saudi EA Deal","<p>Electronic Arts' <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/"">$55 billion deal</a> to sell itself to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and the private equity firm Silver Lake still has to receive regulatory approval before it's finalized.

"This AI VTuber Just Beat A Huge Twitch Record, But It's Not Who You're Expecting","<p>Sometimes, I feel like writing the same article four times could be considered a bit of a meme. But then I remember that this is a pretty phenomenal achievement for any streamer, let alone an AI VTuber. First Neuro-sama beat the Twitch Hype Train world record ... then <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-vtuber-neuro-sama-just-obliterated-her-own-massive-twitch-world-record/1100-6537146/"">it happened again</a>. <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-vtuber-neuro-sama-has-only-gone-and-done-it-again-smashing-another-world-record/1100-6537158/"">And again</a>. This time around, her ""sister"" Evil Neuro, who has her own distinctive voice, model, and attitude, led the calls to beat the Hype Train record for a fourth time. In the process, she also helped her creator<a href=""https://twitch.tv/vedal987""> Vedal987</a> become the third-most-subscribed Twitch channel of all time.</p><p>After becoming the third most-subscribed channel, Vedal joined Evil on stream to ask his community to ""Give it a rest."" He added, ""In all seriousness chat, you have given me and the twins more than we need, so it's okay."" Evil wasn't happy with this though, retorting, ""No Vedal! Please can we raise the timer, just a little bit? Don't you think it's a bit cruel to just cut it off here?"" Evil was referring to the timer that's currently running for Neuro's third birthday subathon, where each subscription gifted to the channel adds time to a countdown clock that determines when the stream will end. It has been running since December 19, 2025, and has around 22 hours left at the time of writing.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeeUq9cNFbU"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YeeUq9cNFbU"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Regardless, shortly afterwards the Hype Train did come to an end at level 72--although not a fourth world record, it's still a hugely impressive achievement, and leaves Vedal's Twitch channel with more than 328,900 subscribers. It's hard to nail down an exact figure, since that number continues to rise as the community attempts to extend the subathon. What that does mean, however, is that Vedal, Neuro, and Evil have overtaken streamer <a href=""https://twitch.tv/jasontheween"">Jasontheween</a> and fellow VTuber<a href=""http://twitch.tv/ironmouse""> Ironmouse</a>'s positions as the third and fourth <a href=""https://twitchtracker.com/subscribers/all-time"">most-subscribed channels on Twitch</a>.

Fortnite X South Park Quests: How To Ride 5 Rides At Cartmanland And Complete Every Quest,"<p>During Fortnite Chapter 6, most every cosmetic you could unlock from a pass or for free was earned simply by gaining XP in any mode. But Epic has returned to the old ways in Chapter 7, with unlockable cosmetics that require completing specific quests. Case in point is the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-x-south-park-all-skins-and-free-event-pass-rewards/2900-7396/"">Born in Chaos mini pass</a> for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-x-south-park-all-skins-rewards-map-changes-and-new-gameplay-items/2900-7391/"">Fortnite's new South Park crossover</a>, which comes with a series of quests that you'll need to complete in order to unlock the otherwise-free cosmetics.</p><p>That means that if you want to get those Terrance and Phillip doll pickaxes, you'll actually need to pay attention to these quests. Some of them you'll certainly complete by accident if you play Fortnite regularly, but others will require a bit of conscious effort. And we'll make it just a smidge easier by handling the thinking part for you--which is to say that we'll explain each quest in detail below.</p><p>All of these quests must be completed in Battle Royale or Zero Build, and they provide pass progress only. The quests themselves don't offer XP directly, but there are three level skips you can unlock as you progress the event pass, and you can already earn one of them (worth 80,000 XP) by completing five quests. Completing four quests from a batch will award a Memberberry--collecting six Memberberries awards the Imaginationland Airship glider.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-x-south-park-quests-how-to-ride-5-rides-at-cartmanland-and-complete-every-quest/1100-6537301/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-10T12:18:55.479653
"Manor Lords Publisher Has Banned AI Assets In Its Games, Calls Them ""Cancerous""","<p>The publisher behind strategy games Endless Legend 2, Terra Invicta, and Against the Storm has officially banned the use of AI-generated assets in all its products. Hooded Horse has had a significant presence in the strategy game space over the last few years, thanks to hits like Manor Lords. Now, when many publishers and developers are evaluating (or touting) their relationship to generative AI, Hooded Horse is rebuking its use for art generation.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender discussed the ban in an interview with <a href=""https://kotaku.com/hooded-horse-gen-ai-art-ban-4x-strategy-steam-2000658179"">Kotaku</a>, emphasizing that restrictions on AI art are part of every contract Hooded Horse signs. He said, ""It is now written into our contracts if we’re publishing the game, 'no f**king AI assets.'"" He also expressed personal exasperation with how GenAI has made his job harder. He said, ""If I sound frustrated, it’s because, like, honestly, all this thing has done is made our lives more difficult.""</p><p dir=""ltr"">This frustration comes from the fact that GenAI usage can be difficult to catch. Even if the intention is to use a generated asset only as a placeholder, those assets can easily make their way to the final product. ""We’ve gotten to the point where we also talk to developers and we recommend they don’t use any gen AI anywhere in the process,"" Bender elaborated.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/manor-lords-publisher-has-banned-ai-assets-in-its-games-called-them-cancerous/1100-6537300/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-10T12:18:55.479653

"Larian Studios Draws Harder Line On AI, Clarifies Stance In Reddit AMA","<p>Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke, as well as creative directors, recently <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyl9tdz/"">participated in an AMA on Reddit</a> to set expectations for the studio’s <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/divinity/"">upcoming Divinity game</a>, particularly about its stance on generative AI--a hot-button topic in the industry right now. Responding to a fan question about the role of generative AI in game development, Vincke was rather blunt: ""There is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity.""</p><p>His comments arrive amid wider debate over how and whether AI should be used in creative processes, especially as some high-profile games have faced backlash for such use.

Fire Emblem: Path Of Radiance Joins Switch Online’s GameCube Classics Library,"<p>Ahead of the release of <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave-coming-to-switch-2-in-2026/1100-6534686/"">Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave</a> later this year, Nintendo has added Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance to the Switch 2's library of GameCube classics. Regarded as one of the best entries in the entire franchise, Path of Radiance will be available for all Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers.</p><p>First released in 2005, Path of Radiance earned critical acclaim for its dark storyline, mature themes, and for being the first 3D Fire Emblem game. Set on the fictional continent of Tellius, the game follows the mercenary Ike and his companions as they set out to rescue a princess and save the kingdom of Crimea from the invading nation of Daein.</p><p>Like previous Fire Emblem games, Path of Radiance is a turn-based tactical RPG that features permadeath: Any character who falls in battle is permanently lost for the rest of the game. A sequel--Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn--was released for the Nintendo Wii in 2007.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fire-emblem-path-of-radiance-joins-switch-online-gamecube-classics-library/1100-6537292/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-10T12:18:55.479653
Arc Raiders Dev Promises New Anti-Cheating Measures Are Coming Soon,"<p>The extraction shooter <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a> has proven to be one of the top hits of 2025, which has in turn attracted some unscrupulous players who aren't above cheating to win. After the rule-abiding Arc Raiders players became vocal about their displeasure, Embark Studios has announced that new anti-cheat measures are on their way to the game.</p><p>""We've seen the discussion around the topic of cheaters in Arc Raiders,"" reads the message shared on Arc Raiders' Discord server via <a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-has-a-cheater-problem-but-embarks-says-significant-changes-are-coming-to-detection-and-ban-systems/"">PC Gamer</a>. ""Please know that we are taking this issue very seriously and are listening to, and acting on your feedback. Over the next few weeks, we are implementing significant changes to our rulesets and deploying new detection mechanisms to identify and remove cheaters. This includes updating our Anti-Cheat systems for improved detection and bans, as well as applying client-side fixes specifically addressing the 'out of map glitch.' Furthermore, we are introducing tools for streamers to help mitigate stream sniping.""</p><p>A firm timetable for the anti-cheat measures wasn't disclosed. However, Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund recently revealed that Arc Raiders has quietly introduced ""<a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-now-features-aggression-based-matchmaking-dev-confirms/1100-6537178/"">aggression-based matchmaking</a>."" Söderlund went on to clarify that matchmaking is still skill-based, but it will also match players ""based on how likely you are to engage in fights with fellow players.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-new-anti-cheating-measures-are-coming-soon/1100-6537291/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-10T12:18:55.479653
PUBG: Blindspot Is Heading To Early Access Next Month,"<p>Nearly a year ago, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-spin-off-gets-a-new-name-and-more-details/1100-6529319/"">Krafton launched the beta test</a> for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/pubg-blindspot/"">PUBG: Blindspot</a>, the first-ever spin-off from <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/"">PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</a> (not counting PUBG Mobile). Now, Krafton has announced that Blindspot is getting an early-access release on February 5.</p><p>This title differs from its predecessor by embracing a top-down perspective and focusing on 5v5 battles in a tactical showdown. Attacking teams are tasked with making their way through a building in order to break into a vault and install a device called the Decrypter. Specific weapons like grenade launchers and explosive hammers can break down the walls standing between the players and their goal. Defending players can set up barricades to slow down their adversaries, but these are battles that ultimately come down to gunplay.</p><p>The newly released trailer shows off some of the improvements coming to the early-access build, including enhanced visuals and UI, as well as balance adjustments and control refinements. Krafton describes it as a ""launch-ready level of quality"" in support of ongoing development.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-blindspot-is-heading-to-early-access-next-month/1100-6537290/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-10T12:18:55.479653
This Star Wars Overhaul Mod Makes Starfield Really Fun To Play,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/"">Starfield</a> has had a somewhat divisive response from players since it debuted in 2023, but there is a Star Wars mod that transforms it into a more rewarding experience. The Star Wars: Genesis mod was released in 2024, but this year, it's adding lightsabers and a more immersive experience for Starfield PC players who want to take the plunge.</p><p>Star Wars: Genesis was created by a modder who goes by DeityVengy, and it's available for free on <a href=""https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/11114"">Nexus Mods</a>. The mod features an original story that's set between the prequel and original Star Wars trilogies. There is an update coming before the end of January that adds even more content to the mod, and DeityVengy showed off some of those new features in the video below.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmMqk-PvEak"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OmMqk-PvEak"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>In the video, DeityVengy notes that using a lightsaber forces players into a first-person perspective because Starfield's melee animations weren't up to the challenge of depicting lightsaber combat. The story featured in this clip also focuses on the player's character confronting one of the Nightsisters of Dathomir before letting them decide whether to spare or slay her.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-star-wars-overhaul-mod-makes-starfield-really-fun-to-play/1100-6537289/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-10T12:18:55.479653

The 3D platformer has a <a href=""https://www.metacritic.com/game/donkey-kong-bananza/"">91 Metascore</a> from critics and 9/10 from users on review aggregator Metacritic. It's currently the <a href=""https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/nintendo-switch-2/"">fourth highest-rated Switch 2 game</a> based on Metascore.

Bananza's large, colorful zones look great whether you're playing on a 4K TV or the Switch 2's 7.9-inch screen. Performance sometimes drops to 30fps during frenzied terrain destruction sequences, but Bananza targets, and often maintains, 60fps in docked and handheld modes. It's probably Nintendo's most impressive Switch 2 game from a technical perspective.</p><p>The physical edition includes the full 8.9GB game file on the card, so you're saving a small chunk of storage space by opting for physical over digital.

Xbox Exclusive RPG Avowed Is Coming To PS5 With New Features,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/"">Avowed</a>, Obsidian's 2025 RPG originally released on Xbox Series X/S and PC, is coming to PlayStation 5. The new version of Avowed, announced during the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yhr_UqvElk"">New Game+ Showcase</a>, will be available on Sony's system on February 17, 2026--just a day short of the one-year anniversary of the game's original release. Microsoft remains the game's publisher, having <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-acquires-fallout-new-vegas-star-wars-knights-/1100-6463175/"">purchased Obsidian</a> in 2018.</p><p>The game, a first-person action RPG set in the world of Pillars of Eternity, tasks players with investigating a mysterious plague, fighting their way through a sprawling world with a mix of weapons and magic.</p><p>Alongside the PS5 version, Obsidian will also release an anniversary update for the game for all systems. This update will add a ""New Game Plus"" mode, which lets you carry over all of your equipable gear to a new character, reset to level 1, and fight modified enemies. It also adds a photo mode, three new playable races, the ability to change your appearance from the overworld, and a new weapon type. The PS5 version will also contain all post-release content and updates that the game has received thus far.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-exclusive-rpg-avowed-is-coming-to-ps5-with-new-features/1100-6537287/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-10T12:18:55.479653
Overwatch 2 Season 20 Midcycle Introduces Showdown Shuffle,"<p>The middle of <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/overwatch-2-battle-pass-season-20-all-skins-emotes-and-rewards/2900-7337/"">Overwatch 2 Season 20</a> has arrived, and the midcycle is bringing the chaos with new modes, new loot, and new in-game collectibles. One of the most notable new additions is Showdown Shuffle, which runs January 13-26. This mode is going to change which character you're controlling, often at random intervals.</p><p>Showdown Shuffle locks players into a role, but not a particular hero. Instead, hero swaps can occur when players reach certain milestones for kills or assists, or even when players are eliminated. According to Blizzard, this was done to encourage players to experiment with new characters and adapt on the fly. Showdown Shuffle will be a 5v5 battle available in Control, Hybrid, Escort, Push, and Flashpoint. Match modifiers will also change throughout the battle for more unpredictable outcomes.</p><p>Starting today through January 11, Assault will return during a Quick Play Hacked event that brings back classic Overwatch maps Temple of Anubis, Hanamura, and Volskaya Industries.

twin sisters Thia and Tessa. Thia is a Weyland-Yutani Corporation synthetic who lost her legs in battle. She defies her programming and teams up with Dek, who builds a backpack-style wheelchair to carry her throughout the hunt. This unique setup leads to some inventive action sequences. Tessa, meanwhile, is the primary antagonist in Badlands. Fanning does a great job portraying both characters, and Koloamatangi's performance as the new Predator is superb.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/predator-badlands-4k-blu-ray-limited-edition-steelbook-predator-alien-movie-collections/1100-6537281/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-10T12:18:55.479653
Rockstar's Battle With Union Over Fired Devs Goes To Court,"<p>Near the end of October 2025, Rockstar fired over thirty devs in the United Kingdom and Canada over what it called ""gross misconduct."" The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/"">accused Rockstar of union busting</a> for laying off workers who were organizing with the union. Both sides have held firm since the initial accusations, and now the battle has gone to court in the UK.</p><p>As reported by <a href=""https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fired-rockstar-games-developers-fight-for-payroll-relief-at-employment-tribunal-hearing/"">Video Games Chronicle</a>, Rockstar and the IWGB went before the court earlier this week, where the latter requested that the fired workers be given ""interim relief"" while the legal drama plays out. If granted, that would place the affected workers back on Rockstar's payroll and allow some to keep their visas that were reliant on their jobs. The court will reportedly decide on the matter before the end of the week.</p><p>The IWGB pledged to continue fighting for the workers regardless of the court's decision, while Rockstar reiterated its position that the workers broke the company's policy.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstars-battle-with-union-over-fired-devs-goes-to-court/1100-6537286/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-10T12:18:55.479653
New Switch 2 Joy-Cons Are Here And They're Extremely Underwhelming,"<p>Nintendo has revealed its first set of <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-joy-con-2-light-purple-light-green-preorder-roundup/1100-6537276/"">new Joy-Con controllers</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2 and I'll be honest, I'm a bit disappointed.</p><p>To be clear, I'm not disappointed (or surprised) by the $100 price tag, as the original Switch Joy-Cons are still $90, the standard Switch 2 Joy-Cons are $100, and all gaming hardware is <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/"">pretty expensive</a> right now. No, it's not the cost that bothers me, but rather how little these new Joy-Cons differentiate themselves from the pair that already exist.</p><p>Similar to the original Switch's Joy-Cons, it appears that the various colorways for the Switch 2 versions will feature two different colors; in the case of these newly announced Joy-Cons, those colors are a bright, pastel purple and a vibrant aqua that the company refers to as ""Light Green."" Despite not fully agreeing with Nintendo on what constitutes light green, I actually really like these new colors. It took a long time for me to care for any of the original Switch's Joy-Con colorways enough to purchase them, as the vast majority are extremely saturated and don't feature color combinations that I feel pair well together. I was so starved for options, in fact, that I purchased the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch largely because I thought it featured the best Joy-Con colors available. In that sense, these new Joy-Cons definitely feel like an improvement.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-switch-2-joy-cons-are-here-and-theyre-extremely-underwhelming/1100-6537284/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-10T12:18:55.479653
"New GTA 6 Delay Rumor Shot Down By Reporter, Says Statement Was Misconstrued","<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/"">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is still a little over 10 months away, assuming its November 2026 release window holds. Earlier this week, GTA 6 watchers were unsettled when Bloomberg's Jason Schreier noted that the game might not be as ""content complete"" as Rockstar has said in the past, and he didn't rule out another delay. Some fans took that as if GTA 6 was already pushed back again, which is why Schreier has stepped forward to clarify his comments.</p><p>During a recent appearance on the <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/episode/1EANk4uOn68ddip6pKliqY"">Button Mash</a> podcast, Schreier said, ""The last I heard, [GTA 6] was still not content complete. That is to say people were still finishing things up, still finalizing levels, and missions, and seeing what is going to make it into the game."" He added that he doesn't ""think anyone at Rockstar can tell you, with 100% certainty, that they will make it out in November.""</p><p>Schreier responded to reports based on his comments by reiterating that he ""wouldn't be shocked if GTA 6 'does' come out this fall, following the same delay pattern as [Red Dead Redemption 2]."" He also characterized some of the reports as, ""a complete misunderstanding of what I said.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-gta-6-delay-rumor-shot-down-by-reporter-says-statement-was-misconstrued/1100-6537283/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-10T12:18:55.479653

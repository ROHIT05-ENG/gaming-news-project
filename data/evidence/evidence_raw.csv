Fans are convinced a Raid: Shadow Legends collaboration could signal the impending arrival of an Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake,"<img src=""https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/AC-black-flag_JY4OziI.jpg?width=690&quality=85&format=jpg&auto=webp"" /> <p>We've been hearing <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards"">rumblings of a full-blown remake of Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a> for the longest time now. After <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-review"">Skull & Bones</a>' troubled development, those current-gen assets could boost the production of such a project, so the idea never sounded too far-fetched. We've yet to receive official news on it though. Now, a new <a href=""https://raidshadowlegends.com/"">Raid: Shadow Legends</a> event has got hungry Assassin's Creed fans all hot under the collar.

<p>The free-to-play ""battle collection RPG"" has been enjoying lots of success on mobile devices since it launched in 2018, but we don't blame you if you've never heard about it (other than in sponsored intros in YouTube video essays). That said, a quick glance at YouTube&rsquo;s massive community around the Plarium Games-developed gacha will shock you: it's one of those games that trundles on quietly in the background, seemingly forever.</p>
<p>This week, it's been getting ready to welcome characters from the Assassin's Creed series via a new event which starts tomorrow, 8th January (hat tip to <a href=""https://bsky.app/profile/accesstheanimus.com/post/3mbtha4s4u22z"">Access the Animus on BlueSky</a>).</p>
<p>The key here is the short teaser - which hasn't hit YouTube yet as far as we can tell - that ends with pirate-turned-assassin Edward Kenway joining the fantasy battleground. We don't get to see the full design, which seems to resemble the original CGI model rather, than the in-game one we got in 2013.</p>
<p>Given the choice to end on him and <em>not</em> to reveal his full look, all the recent info we have about <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards"">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced being real</a> and close by, and buzz suggesting <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-could-set-sail-before-april"">Ubisoft might have a surprise in store for us before Q1 2026 ends</a>, it&rsquo;s easy to see why fans are shaking right now.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm of the opinion the January release schedule is looking a bit light on big new releases. With February and March looking way more packed, could Ubisoft be planning to shadow-drop the Black Flag remake on us out of nowhere? Considering <a href=""https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remastered-a-shadow-dropped-title-made-it-into-the-top-10-best-selling-games-of-2025.1387183/"">last year's Oblivion remaster snuck into the list of best-selling video games in the US</a> with no lead-up marketing, such an approach to Black Flag Resynced and/or <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet"">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> would make sense. That's just me theorising, however, so don't cannonball us if the ship isn't ready to sail yet.</p></p> <p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/raid-shadow-legends-collaboration-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake"">Read more</a></p>",2026-01-08T00:53:58.813771

There's probably a lot of celebratory stuff coming over the next 12 months, but let's start with a franchise we know is getting some attention this year before anything else: Persona.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-30th-anniversary-boxing-fitness-more-announcements"">Read more</a></p>",2026-01-08T00:53:58.813771

There's no way you can miss it unless you've flipped the nudity switch off, in which case it's replaced by an even more conspicuous black box that only amplifies the naughtiness of the part hidden within. But most people don't turn nudity off because they're expecting boobs. That's what we usually see.

Newer movies and all-time classics frequently sell out during 3 for $33 promotions.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-4k-blu-ray-sale-january-2026-3-for-33-new-movie-deal/1100-6537208/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-08T00:53:58.813771

When Outlaws originally released on PS5, Xbox, and PC, the Gold Edition was $110, so Switch 2 owners were already getting a nice deal when Outlaws launched on the new Nintendo console in September.</p><p>The Gold Edition is bundled with the Star Wars Outlaws Season Pass. Most notably, the Season Pass grants access to two story expansions called Wild Card and A Pirate's Fortune. You'll also get a few other extras. Here's the full list:</p><ul><li>Star Wars Outlaws Game-Key Card  <ul><li><em>Requires 19.4GB download</em></li></ul></li><li>Season Pass  <ul><li>Story Expansion 1 - Wild Card</li><li>Story Expansion 2 - A Pirate's Fortune</li><li>Exclusive Mission - Jabba's Gambit</li><li>The Kessel Runner Character Pack (Cosmetics)</li><li>The Hunter's Legacy Bundle (Cosmetics)</li><li>The Cartel Ronin Bundle (Cosmetics)</li></ul></li></ul><p>Star Wars Outlaws is a Game-Key Card with a roughly 20GB download. At launch, Ubisoft explained that storing the game data on a Switch 2 card negatively impacted performance, so the development team opted for the Game-Key Card format.</p><p>From a performance perspective, Outlaws is one of the most impressive third-party games on Switch 2. It runs in 1440p resolution at 30fps in docked mode and 1080p at 30fps in handheld mode. It's certainly a downgrade in graphics compared to PS5, Xbox, and PC, but Outlaws makes great use of DLSS, VRR, and ray-tracing to offer solid visuals and consistent performance with minimal drops. Considering Star Wars Outlaws runs terribly on Steam Deck--it's marked as ""unsupported""--it's cool that Massive Entertainment found a way to make a pleasant handheld experience on Switch 2.</p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Outlaws-Gold-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0F79Z9V31?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                                                      <div>                        <a href=""https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Star-Wars-Outlaws-GOLD-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2/16344962410&subId1=subid_value"">See at Walmart</a>           </div>                                                                                                             <div>                        <a href=""https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1804712/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fstar-wars-outlaws-gold-edition-nintendo-switch-2%2FJ3ZY37H9JP&partnerpropertyid=1423009"">See at Best Buy</a>           </div>                                    </div>      </div>   </div> </div><p>Set during the height of the Galactic Empire's reign, Outlaws puts you in the boots of Kay Vess, an opportunistic lawbreaker chasing down a score that'll help pay off the debts she owes to the criminal underworld of Star Wars. The third-person action-adventure unfolds on and between five planets in the galaxy. Four of the planets have an open-world design that encourages exploration. Outlaws is a well-rounded experience that mixes gunplay with stealth and hand-to-hand combat. You can customize your character and your ship, the Trailblazer, which you control when traveling across the galaxy. And yes, Star Wars Outlaws has space combat, too.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-nintendo-switch-2-game-amazon-deal/1100-6535986/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-08T00:53:58.813771
Minecraft Is Getting Even Cuter With New Baby Mobs,"<p>Baby mobs have been around <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/"">Minecraft</a> for a while, but these creatures are getting an adorable makeover for a future update. Mojang Studios has shared a first look at its upcoming baby mob remasters, which is currently being tested. When the update is finished, the dev team promises that the wolf pups, kittens, piglets, calves, baby chickens, baby ocelots, lambs, and baby rabbits will be ""even chunkier, floofier, and more charming than ever before.""</p><p>In the accompanying announcement video, game director Agnes Larsson explains that previous baby mobs were just scaled down versions of the adult creatures. This update is giving the baby animals their own specific designs and completely new sound recordings pulled from real animals.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaLDBHodmGs"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FaLDBHodmGs"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Larsen went on to explain a more subtle touch that gives the baby mobs' faces a more youthful appearance.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-is-getting-even-cuter-with-new-baby-mobs/1100-6537263/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-08T00:53:58.813771
South Park X Fortnite Includes New 5-Person Mode And Free Mini-Pass,"<p>The long-rumored <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/"">Fortnite</a> collab with South Park is now official, as Epic Games dropped a new short film that shows how the boys are going to get sucked into the metaverse. We also got some specifics about what the collab will entail: a new five-player mode for Battle Royale, a free mini-pass through which players can earn South Park cosmetics, and at least five skins in the item shop. Oh, and Wonkeeland on the BR map will become Cartmanland.</p><p>Using a short film to reveal the collab is something that Fortnite recently also did for its Simpsons-themed season in November--a Fortnite collaboration being something else that The Simpsons did before Butters could. The brief video, which includes a gameplay teaser at the end, shows us that the boys are avid Fortnite players, but Butters never gets to play with them since squads are capped at four players. So he tries to use the Stick of Truth to make them play with him, but it doesn't go quite the way he thought it would.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13QoRmIFK0c"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/13QoRmIFK0c"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>South Park's intrusion into Fortnite will come with several changes for Battle Royale. Wonkeeland is now Cartmanland, there will be a Cheesy Poofs healing item and a Stick of Truth mythic weapon, and for the first time you'll be able to play Fortnite's main mode in a group of five. Beyond that, this collaboration will also include an event pass--something Fortnite used to do regularly until the end of Chapter 5. This pass will be free to everyone, and we don't know anything about what it will include.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/south-park-x-fortnite-includes-new-5-person-mode-and-free-mini-pass/1100-6537262/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-08T00:53:58.813771
Roguelikes Are More Popular Than Ever And It's Becoming A Problem,"<p dir=""ltr"">For any studio, garnering enough interest and success in a video game to the point where a sequel is justified is a commendable feat. And yet, when you're navigating a space that's growing ever more saturated--such as the case of roguelikes and roguelites--a sequel can become a necessary evil rather than a cherished opportunity to further explore existing ideas.</p><p dir=""ltr"">The roguelike genre is brimming with creativity, and the efforts of small studios over the years have led to a plethora of dedicated communities. Popularity broke containment years ago, with bigger industry names giving the genre a spin. Some have introduced modes separately from the main experience, including Prey: Mooncrash, God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla, and the Freelancer mode for Hitman: World of Assassination, to name a few examples. Others, like Returnal and Elden Ring Nightreign, introduced themselves as AAA productions of these concepts.</p><p dir=""ltr"">As more developers continue to push boundaries in the space, whether that is Balatro and Buckshot Roulette kicking off a wave of engrossing gambling-inspired games, or studios still trying to capitalize on the Vampire Survivors formula, there has been a steady trend that, in some ways, is holding developers back. Put simply, the space is being overcrowded by sequels.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roguelikes-are-more-popular-than-ever-and-its-becoming-a-problem/1100-6537259/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-08T00:53:58.813771

"Microsoft Exec Dismisses Mass Layoff Report: ""100% Made Up""","<p>If you spend any time on social media, whether that be Bluesky or X, you may have seen some reports going around that Microsoft is preparing to cut tens of thousands of jobs amidst the rising costs of artificial intelligence.

It comes with two sets of leaves. For a summer look, you can decorate the tree with dark and bright green Lego elements. Alternatively, you can give the tree an autumn appearance with yellow and brown leaves. One neat aspect here is that Lego used sustainable plant-based plastic to manufacture the roughly 180 pieces of tree foliage.</p><p>Along with two different display modes, the Lego Tree House has numerous modular components and interactive features, including a supply basket attached to a functional wind-up crane and removable roofs on the three distinct cabin rooms: main bedroom, kids' room, and bathroom.</p><p>The set comes with a family of four Lego minifigures representing mom, dad, and two kids as well as a bird figure. You'll build bunk beds for the kids' room and a larger bed for the main bedroom. Each room is filled with accessories and decorations such as a treasure map, a ship in a bottle, and a compass. The main bedroom has a balcony where you can pull up the basket of supplies. You'll also build a sink, bathtub, and toilet for the bathroom.</p><p>A brick-built ladder spirals down to the landscape base, where the minifigure family can eat lunch at the brick-built picnic table, enjoy the afternoon breeze on the swing, and get warm by the bonfire. The multi-colored base has various plants as well as a buildable stream.</p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PX3WW5N?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>   </div> </div><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4631836-legoideastreehouseimage.png"" data-ref-id=""1300-4631836"" data-ratio=""0.6"" data-width=""1000"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 1000px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4631836-legoideastreehouseimage.png""><img alt=""Lego Ideas Tree House (3,036 pieces)"" src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4631836-legoideastreehouseimage.png"" srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4631836-legoideastreehouseimage.png 1000w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1595/15950357/4631836-legoideastreehouseimage.png 480w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" data-width=""1000""></a><figcaption>Lego Ideas Tree House (3,036 pieces)</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>Amazon has deals on a number of other Lego Ideas and Lego Icons building sets for adults.

PlayStation Hyperpop PS5 DualSense Collection Revealed,"<p>It's the start of a new year, and you might be tempted to give your PS5 console a makeover. Fortunately, Sony has a new selection of limited-edition PS5 console covers and DualSense controllers on the way, all sporting vivid neon colors. The Hyerpop Collection PS5 console covers will be a PS Direct Store exclusive priced at $75, while the DualSense controllers will cost $85 each. Preorders will open on January 16 ahead of their March 12 launch.</p><p>Like the console covers, the DualSense controllers will be available in three distinct colorways. Techno Red is a loud, vibrant option that fades to a glossy black at the top. First released in November 2020, the DualSense controller features adaptive triggers, a built-in microphone, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a Create Button for when you want to quickly grab in-game screenshots and video clips. Remix Green also pops nicely on the DualSense controller, with this particular shade being an instant attention-grabber. While it's also a bright color, Rhythm Blue is a touch softer than the two options above it. The blue tones give the DualSense controller a <em>slightly </em>subdued and calmer effect.</p><div title=""6537254 -- Hyperpop Collection DualSense Controllers"" data-embed-type=""buylink""

Arc Raiders Dormant Barons Quest Guide,"<p>Early on in the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a> questline, you'll be sent to find and loot a Baron Husk. The Dormant Barons quest may sound a bit scary--big Arc can be quite frightening, after all--but these bad boys have long been dead, so you have nothing to worry about when looting their husks. However, finding a Baron Husk may take a bit more searching than you'd like--unless you take a look at our guide below. Here's where to find Baron Husks and how to loot them.</p><h2>Where to find Baron Husks</h2><p>Baron Husks are large, destroyed Arc that can be found on multiple maps, but the safest and most easily accessible map to search for them on is Dam Battlegrounds. This map is the first one you'll have access to at the beginning of your journey, and it contains a total of three Baron Husks you can visit. We've marked the locations on the map below.</p><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631087-arcraiders_20260106195742.jpg"" data-ref-id=""1300-4631087"" data-ratio=""0.56322393822394"" data-width=""2072"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 2072px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631087-arcraiders_20260106195742.jpg""><img alt=""Baron Husk locations on Dam Battlegrounds"" src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4631087-arcraiders_20260106195742.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631087-arcraiders_20260106195742.jpg 2072w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4631087-arcraiders_20260106195742.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/679/6794662/4631087-arcraiders_20260106195742.jpg 480w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"" data-width=""1280""></a><figcaption>Baron Husk locations on Dam Battlegrounds</figcaption></figure><p>We'd recommend visiting one of the Baron Husks on the left side of the map, as the one at the Breach is in a very exposed area and often has a Sentinel turret scouting the area.

Arc Raiders A Bad Feeling Quest Guide,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a> quests can sometimes get pretty complicated, demanding you venture across multiple maps to complete various objectives. A Bad Feeling isn't one of these, though, as it asks something quite simple of you: Just open an Arc Probe or Arc Courier. But where exactly will you find one of these, and what will you find inside? We're here to answer that for you, so read on for where to find Arc Probes and Arc Couriers.</p><div data-embed-type=""toc""><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a href=""https://www.gamespot.com"">hide</a>]</span><ul id=""toc_list"" class=""collapse in""><li><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com"">Where to find Arc Probes</a></li></ul></div><h2 id=""Where_to_find_Arc_Probes"">Where to find Arc Probes</h2><p>You may occasionally see a fresh Arc Probe come in from the sky (keep an eye out for something that looks like a rocket coming down). These will be standing straight up once they land. However, these aren't likely to be the probes you normally come across, as most Arc Probes are found tipped over on their sides. In either case, you can hear Arc Probes from some distance--listen for their odd bleeps and bloops emitting every few seconds.</p><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631034-share_20260106_1105380.jpeg"" data-ref-id=""1300-4631034"" data-ratio=""0.5625"" data-width=""3840"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 3840px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631034-share_20260106_1105380.jpeg""><img alt=""Arc Probe"" src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4631034-share_20260106_1105380.jpeg"" srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631034-share_20260106_1105380.jpeg 3840w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4631034-share_20260106_1105380.jpeg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/679/6794662/4631034-share_20260106_1105380.jpeg 480w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"" data-width=""1280""></a><figcaption>Arc Probe</figcaption></figure><p>While they're found in randomized spots all across every map, Arc Probes are considerably more common during the <strong>Electromagnetic Storm</strong> map event.

Arc Raiders Back On Top Quest Guide,"<p>Quests in <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a> most frequently require you to visit only one map, but you'll occasionally encounter some that send you across multiple maps to complete them. One of these quests is Back on Top, which asks you to visit all four launch maps and mark specific buildings. It's not a particularly challenging quest, but it can be rather time consuming due to the amount of travel time needed to reach each building on the maps.

Lenovo Legion Go 2 SteamOS Edition Revealed,"<p>There's no shortage of handheld gaming PCs to choose from lately, but the Steam Deck has been a popular option thanks in part to its operating system. SteamOS works far better than Windows on these machines, and fortunately, it's available on another device: Lenovo's Legion Go 2. The company recently rolled out the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lenovo-legion-go-2-handheld-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6534509/"">Legion Go S with SteamOS</a>, but for anyone looking for a handheld with more heavy-duty hardware--and Switch-like controllers--the Legion Go 2 has been a solid option. Lenovo will start selling the Legion Go 2 with SteamOS preinstalled in June, with pricing starting at $1,199.</p><p>Preorders aren't open at the time of writing, but it's likely that you'll find a listing at Best Buy and Amazon soon for the Legion Go 2. Compared to other PC gaming handhelds, the Legion Go 2 offers a lot of technical bang for your buck. The premium model is powered by the AMD Z2 Extreme chip, has 32GB of DDR5 RAM, a 1TB SSD, and a 74Wh battery. The base model uses the AMD Z2 SoC, has 16GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and the same battery.</p><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4631728-legion-go-2.jpg"" data-ref-id=""1300-4631728"" data-ratio=""0.5625"" data-width=""1280"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 1280px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4631728-legion-go-2.jpg""><img alt=""Lenovo Legion Go 2 SteamOS"" src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4631728-legion-go-2.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4631728-legion-go-2.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1601/16018044/4631728-legion-go-2.jpg 480w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"" data-width=""1280""></a><figcaption>Lenovo Legion Go 2 SteamOS</figcaption></figure><p>Both models also share one of the best screens you can find on a gaming handheld in the form of an 8.8-inch PureSight OLED display.

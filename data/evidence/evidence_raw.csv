The Last of Us' Bruce Straley Shares More Details About Why He Left Naughty Dog,"<p>From 1999 to 2017, Bruce Straley was one of the key players at Naughty Dog, and the co-director of two its best-selling games, The Last of Us and Uncharted 4.

How Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Fails The Genre Nintendo Created,"<p dir=""ltr"">New Metroid games are few and far between, so the launch of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond should have been a monumental event for the fanbase. Instead, eight years after its announcement, and 18 years after the previous game, Nintendo’s big December 2025 release landed with a loud thud. Already, this once highly anticipated title is poised to be one of the series' most divisive games, earning a spot alongside Other M and Federation Force.</p><p dir=""ltr"">This isn't for lack of polish, as Prime 4 is indeed visually stunning and perhaps the greatest first-party <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-switch-2-good-news-metroid-prime-4-runs-pretty-well-on-switch-1/1100-6536733/"">showcase of graphics on the Nintendo Switch</a> and its successor. But while it has its share of enthusiasts, it’s difficult not to feel underwhelmed by the final product in comparison to prior Prime games and even other, similar entries in the Metroidvania space that has grown in Nintendo’s frequent absence.</p><p dir=""ltr"">The <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-metroidvania-games/2900-4005/"">list of Metroidvania games</a> from independent and third-party developers in the past decade alone is astonishing, with Ori and the Blind Forest, Axiom Verge, Hollow Knight, Dead Cells, Animal Well, and others throwing new concepts and innovations into the genre’s well of ideas. Hollow Knight and its follow-up, Silksong, have captivated players with their dense worldbuilding, roaming NPCs, and optional side objectives, all of which have come to define the critically acclaimed series. Nine Sols stood out with its intricate combat system, while more out-there games like pinball Metroidvania Yoku’s Island Express have proven anything can be a Metroidvania with the right amount of determination and creativity. Even Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown changed the game with something as simple as an in-game screenshot system to help with backtracking. The Metroidvania genre is rapidly iterating with a volume of unique takes.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-metroid-prime-4-beyond-fails-the-genre-nintendo-created/1100-6536896/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-13T03:39:52.558094

Pragmata will take up an estimated 17GB of storage space on your Switch 2's internal hard drive or microSD Express card.</p><p>Physical preorders are available at Amazon for $60, and we expect more retailers will have the game soon.

With the defense mechanisms of the facility activated and hunting him down, Hugh finds an unlikely ally in his quest to escape: Diana, an android who resembles a young girl. While Diana isn't a fighter, she can ride shotgun on Hugh's back and hack them so that their weak points can be exposed. Hugh can then finish them off, using his arsenal of weapons.

Star Wars: Fate Of The Old Republic Is Probably Many Years Away From Release,"<p>The release of the upcoming RPG Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is likely far, far away. While <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-star-wars-rpg-returns-to-the-old-republic/1100-6536905/"">last night's announcement trailer</a> at <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/"">The Game Awards 2025</a> was surely exciting for Knights of the Old Republic fans, the truth is that the game, led by original KOTOR and Mass Effect director Casey Hudson, is in a very early stage of development.</p><p>According to the <a href=""https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-trailer"">official Star Wars website</a>, Hudson's new studio, Arcanaut Studios, was formed just this year, after <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-veterans-new-studio-which-was-making-aaa-sci-fi-game-is-shutting-down/1100-6528039/"">his previous studio closed</a> in November 2024. The <a href=""https://www.arcanautstudios.com/careers"">studio's careers page</a> contains listings for several senior-level positions, so the announcement trailer also doubles as a recruitment advertisement, a <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-dev-reminds-fans-that-cg-trailers-are-often-used-first-and-foremost-to-recruit-staff/1100-6496192/"">tactic that developers often employ</a>.</p><p>With the lengthy development cycles that high-profile games undergo these days, we're probably years away from seeing anything concrete from Fate of the Old Republic, and even further from a release. Skepticism about the game even releasing this decade is quite reasonable.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-is-probably-many-years-away-from-release/1100-6536942/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-13T03:39:52.558094

"IWGB Union Says Rockstar's Statement Is Filled With ""Disinformation"" Over Fired Developers","<p>The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has shot back at Rockstar Games regarding the firing of 30+ staffers, saying that the company's latest statement is ""littered with falsehoods and disinformation.""</p><p>IWGB released a statement clarifying its take on Rockstar Games' justification for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/"">terminating the 30+ UK and international employees</a> in October 2025. Parent company Take-Two Interactive explained that the GTA developer fired those workers for ""gross misconduct, and for no other reason."" More specifically, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-insists-gta-6-devs-were-fired-for-leaks-not-unionizing/1100-6536894/"">Rockstar Games told GameSpot</a> that those developers were let go for discussing ""specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles"" and other ""confidential information"" in a public forum. IWGB took issue with that, telling GameSpot that the characterization is inaccurate.</p><p>""Rockstar's latest statement is littered with falsehoods and disinformation--they have given multiple, conflicting reasons to explain why the workers were fired, as if attempting to reverse engineer a rationale for the dismissals,"" the union said in an emailed statement. ""Once again, they have chosen to mischaracterise workers speaking about their working conditions in a private forum as 'leaking information.' It is hard to understand this statement as anything but a desperate attempt to deflect from the global scrutiny they have come under over the last month. From the UK Prime Minister in the House of Commons, to the game developers across the world erupting in protest--all eyes are on Rockstar and their lawless attack on the people who make them their billions.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iwgb-union-says-rockstars-statement-is-filled-with-disinformation-over-fired-developers/1100-6536941/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-13T03:39:52.558094

In a new interview, Microsoft's president of game content and studios, Matt Booty, spoke about the success of Xbox games on PS5 and the reaction to Halo's announcement for PS5.</p><p>""We had a bit of a moment earlier in the summer from end of April to end of June, where we had six of the top 10 games on PlayStation were our Xbox games,"" Booty said to <a href=""https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty-call-of-duty-movie-dev-direct-plans-1236606594/"">Variety</a>. ""I look at that as validation for the teams, but most importantly, it's an opportunity for more players to engage with our content, to come into our worlds.""</p><p>Halo has long been considered the crown jewel of Xbox, and the next game in the franchise, a campaign-only remake of the original titled <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6535992/"">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, will launch simultaneously on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 in 2026.

You can also customize the joysticks with swappable tops, and the triggers have been upgraded to tactile Digital Triggers.

We also got a peek into another faction of the Mojave Wasteland, one that could potentially spell danger for our protagonists and their questline.</p><p>The episode opens up with a flashback to Shady Sands in its prime; A welcoming city that almost resembles life before The Great War. We open up on Maximus' parents in their lovely home where his father is testing the radiation levels in the water and discovers most of the water beneath the city is safe to drink and could provide a long term home for Shady Sands’ residents. Life is good until a traveling nomad muttering to himself arrives with an atomic bomb, putting the city in danger. Acting fast amongst the panic and chaos, Maximus' father attempts to disarm it but accidentally activates the bomb’s failsafe, starting the three minute timer to detonation. With little time to spare, he puts Maximus in the kitchen refrigerator and he along with his mother give a tearful goodbye before they’re killed in the blast.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-episode-2-summary-war-and-radscoprions-never-change/1100-6537147/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-24T12:20:39.738223
AI VTuber Neuro-Sama Just Obliterated Her Own Massive Twitch World Record,"<p>In early 2025, partway through a subathon to mark her second birthday, the AI VTuber Neuro-Sama became the world record holder for the largest Twitch Hype Train. Many claimed her achievements were possible thanks to Riot's competitive shooter, Valorant, gifting one subscription for each five gifted by the community. Now, only a few days into her third birthday subathon, Neuro-Sama and her creator Vedal987 have smashed that world record. She completed Hype Train level 120 with 118,989 subscriptions and 1,000,073 Bits gifted to the <a href=""https://twitch.tv/vedal987"">Vedal987</a> Twitch channel within a limited time.</p><p>Neuro-Sama is an AI VTuber who recently completed a <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-vtuber-neuro-sama-finally-completes-hardcore-minecraft-but-some-arent-happy/1100-6536784/"">Minecraft Hardcore</a> run with her creator and friends Filian and Crelly. She streams on Vedal's Twitch channel, and is powered by an artificial intelligence system that utilizes a large language model with vast capabilities. She can ""see"" games and respond to them, even being able to play some, she can read her Twitch chat and interact with viewers, and this week she's been playing around in virtual reality with her friends thanks to her new(ish) 3D model.</p><p>Neuro-Sama debuted on Twitch on 19 December 2022, and each subsequent year on the same date she begins a subathon--a continuous stream that has its length determined by the number of subscriptions the community has gifted. When an abnormal number of subscriptions or Bits are gifted within a limited timeframe, a Hype Train is triggered, which shows an on-screen percentage, level, and how many subscriptions are required to progress to the next level. While Neuro-Sama met level 111 in January 2025, this time around she didn't need Valorant's help to decimate her own world record.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-vtuber-neuro-sama-just-obliterated-her-own-massive-twitch-world-record/1100-6537146/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-24T12:20:39.738223
"I Hated Parrying, Until I Played Clair Obscur: Expedition 33","<p dir=""ltr"">Parrying is about subtlety. It's the act of scrutinizing fisticuffs and sword fights with a furrowed brow, familiarizing yourself with the cadence of combat right down to milliseconds, and learning the precise moment of performing a counter attack. For instance, a small variation in animation may point to a rare opening. A slight note change in the audio cue may indicate a shift of attacks from the enemy. To parry well is to understand these details and adapt to them dexterously.</p><p dir=""ltr"">That said, doing so is exhausting. The requirements needed to pull off a parry in most games can be steep and exacting. It's why I'd usually avoid parrying if there are other ways to minimize damage during combat, such as blocking or dodging.</p><p dir=""ltr"">The painterly Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, one of my favorite RPGs this year, has been the exception. Within its dazzling combat system I've discovered the joy of parrying, every encounter an exhilarating sequence of silky-smooth attacks and ripostes. Fighting in Expedition 33 is a resplendent affair, thanks to its surprisingly in-depth and complex structure. Its skirmishes enhance JRPG-inspired turn-based combat with real-time elements that get players to dodge--and parry--at the right moment.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-hated-parrying-until-i-played-clair-obscur-expedition-33/1100-6537003/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-24T12:20:39.738223

But that's not all there is to care about in Fortnite's latest update--we've also got a pair of new sets of quests that reward XP, and an additional free cosmetic that must be earned by completing a specific one of those new quests. Let's take a look at what we've got here.</p><p>Not all of the Winterfest quests are currently available.

What makes this edition special is that it includes hours of exclusive special features, ranging from deleted scenes to an in-depth deconstruction of how several major moments from the movie were created and filmed.</p><p>Additionally, there's a behind-the-scenes presentation by famed filmmaker Jon Landau, RDA promos featuring Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch, and several featurettes examining the script, artwork, and marketing of Avatar. Considering that the film employed several groundbreaking visual and special effects technologies throughout its production, the deep dives into how Avatar was made make for a lengthy and informative look behind the curtain.</p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Avatar-4K-UHD-Sam-Worthington/dp/B0CN76MR2Q?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                                                      <div>                        <a href=""https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAvatar-4K-Ultra-HD-Blu-Ray-Digital-Copy-20th-Century-Studios%2F3252679368&partnerpropertyid=1423009"">See at Walmart</a>           </div>                                                     </div>      </div>                                                                     <div class=""js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container"">             <h2 class=""item-title"">                    <a href=""https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAvatar-4K-Ultra-HD-Blu-Ray-Digital-Copy-20th-Century-Studios%2F3252679368&partnerpropertyid=1423009"">Avatar Standard Edition (4K)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=""item-deck"">                      <a href=""https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAvatar-4K-Ultra-HD-Blu-Ray-Digital-Copy-20th-Century-Studios%2F3252679368&partnerpropertyid=1423009"">$27</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=""image-container"">                                  <img class=""main-image"" src=https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1701/17013431/4627351-avatar.jpg>                             <a href=""https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAvatar-4K-Ultra-HD-Blu-Ray-Digital-Copy-20th-Century-Studios%2F3252679368&partnerpropertyid=1423009""></a>                        </div>              <div class=""item-description""><p>While the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Avatar-4K-UHD-Sam-Worthington/dp/B0C5JTY5W5?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20"">4K version of Avatar</a> isn't as extensive as the Collector's Edition in terms of special features or different cuts of the film, it's still a solid option.

The saga follows Jake Sully, a human whose mind is transferred into a genetically engineered Na'vi body on a mission to infiltrate and sabotage their resistance.

"Expedition 33 Studio Won't Scale Up For Next Project, Even Though It Can","<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was one of 2025's biggest breakout hits, and the game's commercial success has afforded developer Sandfall Interactive the opportunity to scale up for its next project.

"Arc Raiders Is My Game Of The Year, But Its Use Of Generative AI Really Sucks","<p dir=""ltr"">These past two months with Arc Raiders have been the most fun I've had with games all year. It represents the most exciting and unpredictable multiplayer landscape I've jumped into since Sea of Thieves in 2018, which I consider my favorite game ever made. It's safe to say I really love Arc Raiders. But it's become difficult to fully espouse those feelings as we learn about Embark Studio's use of generative AI.</p><p dir=""ltr"">According to the studio, Arc Raiders' voice acting was initially performed by humans, then used to ""train"" AI so that it could speak in the actors' voices while addressing any possible circumstance. For Embark, the team doesn't need to bring in the voice actors each time new content is added to the game. The AI voices learn to speak in the voices of the actors, which the actors are said to have agreed upon when they were hired, and the tools take it from there. Maybe it shouldn't have come as a surprise, since the team's previous game, The Finals, uses generative AI in a similar way. In an <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use"">interview</a>, Embark assured players that the game's visual artwork is entirely human-made, but admitted to using this text-to-speech training to bring voices to the game's shop NPCs, emotes, and other character barks. Knowing this has left me conflicted when I think to sing the game's praises.</p><p dir=""ltr"">On one hand, I can't deny the hold Arc Raiders has taken over me. The heart wants what the heart wants, and Embark's extraction shooter, rich in emergent, player-driven drama, has lit my heart on fire in a way few games ever have. At the same time, I've already written <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arc-raiders-review-us-against-the-world/1900-6418435/"">my review</a>. Though it was a glowing one that I don't regret, I also feel it's my job to call out this disappointing practice. In recent weeks, similar practices or plans have arisen in several high-profile examples. <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/"">Larian Studios' boss vouched</a> for it in some cases. Nexon's former CEO said <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-nexon-ceo-says-aaa-games-are-in-end-of-days-and-ai-is-about-to-rewrite-everything/1100-6536651/"">AI is about to rewrite everything</a> in the games industry.

Expedition 33 Actor Says The Game Awards Best Performance Award Doesn't Credit Everyone,"<p>The actor who provided the motion capture for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's Gustave has spoken out to say it would be ""more logical"" to have a Best Character category at awards shows to help give credit to everyone who contributed to bringing a character to life in a game.

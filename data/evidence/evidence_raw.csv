Its humour is pitch black, yes, and its comedic moments often dance on a knife's edge between laughter and revulsion, but writer and director Andrea Lucco Borlera's first-person narrative horror - his debut game, created in close collaboration with Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione - is a fascinatingly singular vision. It's singular enough, in fact, that it's not an easy thing to effectively describe, but if you can imagine a sort of thematic reinterpretation of Animal Farm by way of Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salo on one side, and a meme-able Garry's Mod video on the other, then Horses gleefully oscillates between them, landing somewhere in the middle.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-review"">Read more</a></p>",2025-12-08T13:47:24.218706

On the other, it is something new for the series, structurally most comparable not to other Metroid games but rather to a different Nintendo adventure franchise (more on that shortly). Then there is how the game is built, feeling almost modular, with different modes and moods of play stitched together with visible seams.

Netflix Considered Buying EA - Report,"<p>As 2025 winds down, the new biggest potential acquisitions of the year appear to be the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/"">$55 billion deal</a> for EA by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and other investors and the more recent proposed <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-announces-purchase-of-warner-bros-for-over-82-billion/1100-6536717/"">$82 billion agreement</a> for Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Studios. Now, a new report suggests that Netflix once considered buying EA and two other movie studios before the Warner Bros. negotiations came together.</p><p>According to <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-07/netflix-co-ceo-ted-sarandos-wooed-trump-personally-ahead-of-warner-bid"">Bloomberg</a>, Netflix executives previously debated whether the streamer should place bids for EA, Fox, and Disney. However, the management team reportedly couldn't agree on a deal and feared that its interest in those companies would hurt its standing with investors.</p><p>The report doesn't include the details about when Netflix considered these acquisitions, especially since Disney is usually the company that buys other studios including Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. Disney purchased Fox's entertainment assets in 2019 following an extended approval process from government agencies around the world.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-considered-buying-ea-report/1100-6536751/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-08T13:47:24.218706

Five Nights At Freddy's 2 Defies Poor Reviews With Big Opening Weekend,"<p>Last week, the early word on <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-five-nights-at-freddys-2-trailer-is-very-scary/1100-6535945/"">Five Nights At Freddy's 2</a> from critics <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/five-nights-at-freddys-2-movie-reviews-are-beary-bad/1100-6536721/"">was overwhelmingly negative</a>, with only 12% on Rotten Tomatoes. It didn't matter to moviegoers, however, as audiences showed up to theaters to check out the sequel anyway.</p><p>According to <a href=""https://deadline.com/2025/12/box-office-five-nights-at-freddys-2-zootopia-2-1236637393/"">Deadline</a>, Five Nights At Freddy's 2 had a $63 million opening weekend in the United States and Canada, and $46 million internationally against a reported $36-$51 million budget. That gave the film a $109 million global opening. The first Five Nights At Freddy's had a higher opening in 2023 with $80 million domestically, despite being released in tandem with the film's streaming premiere on Peacock.</p><p>Regardless, this sequel's opening was big enough to kick Disney's Zootopia 2 out of the No. 1 slot after only a single weekend. It also earned Five Nights At Freddy's 2 a few box office records, including biggest opening for a post-Thanksgiving weekend, biggest December opening for a horror film, and the biggest December opening for Universal Pictures. Additionally, Five Nights At Freddy's 2 now has the third-highest grossing opening weekend for a PG-13 horror movie, behind only the original Five Nights At Freddy's and World War Z, which had $80 million and $66.4 million, respectively.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/five-nights-at-freddys-2-defies-poor-reviews-with-big-opening-weekend/1100-6536749/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-08T13:47:24.218706

The Ryzen Z2 A chip is comparable to Steam Deck's custom AMD APU, and if you increase the TDP--at the expense of battery life--the Xbox Ally can outperform the Steam Deck OLED. For reference, the Steam Deck OLED 512GB model retails for $549.</p><p>The Xbox Ally has a 1920 x 1080p IPS display with 120Hz refresh rate and support for VRR and AMD FreeSync Premium. If you're comparing to the Steam Deck OLED, Valve's handheld has a 7.4-inch 1280 x 800p OLED display with HDR and 90Hz refresh rate. So the Steam Deck wins in panel type and size, but the Xbox Ally wins in resolution and refresh rate. That said, to get the best performance on Xbox Ally, you will often want to lock the resolution at 720p, so the Xbox Ally doesn't always take full advantage of its advantages.</p><p>The Xbox Ally is arguably the most comfortable Windows gaming handheld on the market today. Asus opted for the PlayStation Portal approach by essentially splitting the Xbox Wireless Controller in half and connecting it to each side. Along with all of the buttons, triggers, and bumpers found on the Xbox Wireless Controller, the Xbox Ally has two remappable back buttons. It also has motion controls and HD haptics.</p><p>One of the big selling points of the Xbox Ally is the custom, console-inspired dashboard that is easier to use than the traditional Windows interface. The Xbox Ally has a 512GB SSD, 16GB RAM, a microSD UHS-II card slot to expand storage capacity, two USB-C ports, and a headphone jack.</p><p>Check out the Xbox Ally's specs and features below.

"Elder Scrolls TV Series Is Possible, Says Todd Howard","<p>Later this month, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-episode-release-date-schedule/1100-6536675/"">Fallout</a> will return for Season 2 on Prime Video. It's not the only Bethesda adaptation coming to Amazon's streaming service--a Wolfenstein show is coming as well--and some fans are hoping to see The Elder Scrolls game follow. Bethesda's Todd Howard--who has worked as a producer on Fallout and Elder Scrolls titles--won't rule out the possibility that it could happen. But don't expect an Elder Scrolls series anytime soon.</p><p>While speaking with <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation"">Eurogamer</a>, Howard said that he ""can't rule in or rule out an Elder Scrolls thing in the future,"" before adding that he thought Fallout was more suitable as an adaptation because it had ""more to say in its genre.""</p><p>""But you never know,"" added Howard. ""I think the impact of the show on Fallout as a franchise has been bigger than I expected, so it does make you think like, 'Hey, is there a path?' But nothing today… [and] I'm willing to say 'no' for a decade.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-tv-series-is-possible-says-todd-howard/1100-6536747/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-08T13:47:24.218706

Battlefield 6 Update Adds Winter Offensive And Limited Time Multiplayer Event,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/"">Battlefield 6</a>'s 1.1.3.0 update is bringing the fog of war into winter. As part of the new Winter Offensive, players will be able to access a new version of the Empire State map called Ice Lock Empire State. This map will only be around for a limited time, but it swaps out the standard map with frozen streets and other examples of cold and hazardous weather.</p><p>The new map will also have a themed event mode, allowing you to play Domination, Conquest, and Gauntlet mission variations that utilize the new ""Freeze"" mechanic. Players will also be given access to the ice climbing axe through the Winter Offensive Bonus Path. Once they have the axe, players can unleash it as a melee weapon on unlucky foes. That bonus path also features an 11-tier, time-limited reward track featuring event cosmetics, and XP Boosters.</p><p>According to Battlefield Labs, the new update has ""a broad range of fixes and refinements across Battlefield 6."" Some of the improvements include weapon reliability, vehicle behavior, and quality-of-life bug fixes. You can find the complete notes for this update below.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-adds-winter-offensive-and-limited-time-multiplayer-event/1100-6536745/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-08T13:47:24.218706
Fallout's Ella Purnell Shoots Down Potential Romance For Lucy,"<p>Fallout Season 2 is just around the corner, and Amazon Prime Video has largely kept this season's storyline a secret. But there's one thing we can be reasonably certain about: Ella Purnell's Lucy won't be having a romance with Walton Goggins' Ghoul now or ever.</p><p>During an interview with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWqxIs7dpx0&amp;t=249s"">Geek Culture</a>, Purnell was with Goggins and Aaron Moten when she shot down the very idea of a love affair between Lucy and the Ghoul.</p><p>""Here's what I would say: you guys need therapy,"" said Purnell. ""You can't fix him. You can't save him. Let it go. Let it go, hon.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallouts-ella-purnell-shoots-down-potential-romance-for-lucy/1100-6536744/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-08T13:47:24.218706

"Path Of Exile 2's Next Update Lets Players Transform Into Wolves, Bears, And Wyverns","<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/"">Path of Exile 2</a> players won't have to wait long for the next update. The Last of the Druids is arriving on December 12, and it's putting more than just the magic of the Druids at your command. Players will soon be able to transform their Druids into a wolf, a bear, or even a dragon-like wyvern. The teaser trailer below demonstrates the powers that each new form has to offer.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUsjULYd2q8"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HUsjULYd2q8"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>The Druid's ability to transform is tied to one of three different talismans. As a wolf, players can summon a pack to attack enemies or rip adversaries to shreds with their own teeth and claws. Bears are raw power personified, and they can increase their strength through each roar they make. Becoming a wyvern grants the player the power of flight, as well lightning and fire attacks that can bring any adversary to their knees.</p><p>Even as a human, Druids have formidable abilities to fall back upon. They can command earth and storm elements, which put thunder and volcano attacks at their fingertips. There will be two paths for Druids to ascend to. As a Shaman, Druid magic and spells are amplified to a staggering degree. The Oracle may be the second ascendancy class for the Druids, but it grants players the foresight to predict enemy movements before they happen. Using those visions of the future in battle sounds like it could be very useful.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2s-next-update-lets-players-transform-into-wolves-bears-and-wyverns/1100-6536740/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-08T13:47:24.218706

Others do not believe it is connected to Diablo. Some think it's for the next God of War game. Still others think it could be for The Elder Scrolls 6 or Lords of the Fallen 2. All of these suggestions may be wrong, however.</p><p>On November 28, Keighley posted the tex ""regal.inspiring.thickness"" along with an image of some kind of huge carving featuring humanoid people in the middle of a desert. On November 29, Keighley followed up with a <a href=""https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1994816833464217796"">Google Maps image</a> showing the location of the marketing monolith in the California desert.

Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's Ending Does Samus Dirty (Spoilers),"<p dir=""ltr"">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is intended as both a continuation and a new start for the long dormant franchise. Though Nintendo has never quite said it overtly, it has seemed likely that this is meant to launch a new series of Prime games--possibly even a second trilogy, for the sake of dramatic rhyme. And the ending of Prime 4 accents that feeling, leaving the door wide open for more story--but in the process, diminishing the character of protagonist Samus Aran.</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Spoilers for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond follow.</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">As many eager Metroid fans know from preview coverage and reviews, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond features a wide cast of Federation characters, who have been stranded on Viewros with Samus. As you explore the corners of Sol Valley you eventually meet five in total: engineer Myles MacKenzie, sniper Reger Tokabi, Sergeant Ezra Duke, Private Nora Armstrong, and mech unit VUE-995. Each talks with Samus and relates to her in different ways. Myles is out of his element and needs Samus' rescue. Armstrong is a bona fide Samus superfan. Tokabi opens up to her about his religion and upbringing.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyonds-ending-does-samus-dirty-spoilers/1100-6536738/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-08T13:47:24.218706
A $5 Million Gift From Sega Saved Nvidia,"<p>Nvidia today is the world's most valuable company with a market cap of more than $4 trillion, thanks in large part to the AI boom of the past few years. But Nvidia's success was far from guaranteed.</p><p>CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang recalled recently how a $5 million gift following a failed business deal with Sega gave the company the lifeline it needed at the time, allowing the fledgling company to stay in business and eventually become what it is today.</p><p>Appearing on the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hptKYix4X8&amp;t=5567s"">Joe Rogan Experience podcast</a>, Huang talked about how, back in the 1990s, he and his two co-founders were trying to drum up business for their start-up PC company. They traveled to Japan and pitched Sega management on the idea that Nvidia could build the company's Dreamcast console.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-5-million-gift-from-sega-saved-nvidia/1100-6536736/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-08T13:47:24.218706

""The strong feedback from them is that elements of the game are very likely AI-generated and thus has caused extreme damage to our brand and our company reputation.""</p><p>Desi noted that Running With Scissors has lost trust in Goonswarm Games, which is why the project has now been killed.

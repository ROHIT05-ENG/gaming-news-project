Its humour is pitch black, yes, and its comedic moments often dance on a knife's edge between laughter and revulsion, but writer and director Andrea Lucco Borlera's first-person narrative horror - his debut game, created in close collaboration with Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione - is a fascinatingly singular vision. It's singular enough, in fact, that it's not an easy thing to effectively describe, but if you can imagine a sort of thematic reinterpretation of Animal Farm by way of Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salo on one side, and a meme-able Garry's Mod video on the other, then Horses gleefully oscillates between them, landing somewhere in the middle.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-review"">Read more</a></p>",2025-12-08T03:47:02.295491

On the other, it is something new for the series, structurally most comparable not to other Metroid games but rather to a different Nintendo adventure franchise (more on that shortly). Then there is how the game is built, feeling almost modular, with different modes and moods of play stitched together with visible seams.

Or, more probably, you like some of 'em, aren't too keen on others, and are largely ambivalent to the rest. Whatever your perspective, it's obvious remakes - beloved of risk-averse publishers across the industry - aren't going anywhere. They offer the perfect maelstrom of nostalgia bait and brand recognition, meaning they're an easier sell compared to entirely new games, and if players love them, why stop now?

"Elder Scrolls TV Series Is Possible, Says Todd Howard","<p>Later this month, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-episode-release-date-schedule/1100-6536675/"">Fallout</a> will return for Season 2 on Prime Video. It's not the only Bethesda adaptation coming to Amazon's streaming service--a Wolfenstein show is coming as well--and some fans are hoping to see The Elder Scrolls game follow. Bethesda's Todd Howard--who has worked as a producer on Fallout and Elder Scrolls titles--won't rule out the possibility that it could happen. But don't expect an Elder Scrolls series anytime soon.</p><p>While speaking with <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation"">Eurogamer</a>, Howard said that he ""can't rule in or rule out an Elder Scrolls thing in the future,"" before adding that he thought Fallout was more suitable as an adaptation because it had ""more to say in its genre.""</p><p>""But you never know,"" added Howard. ""I think the impact of the show on Fallout as a franchise has been bigger than I expected, so it does make you think like, 'Hey, is there a path?' But nothing today… [and] I'm willing to say 'no' for a decade.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-tv-series-is-possible-says-todd-howard/1100-6536747/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-08T03:47:02.295491

Battlefield 6 Update Adds Winter Offensive And Limited Time Multiplayer Event,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/"">Battlefield 6</a>'s 1.1.3.0 update is bringing the fog of war into winter. As part of the new Winter Offensive, players will be able to access a new version of the Empire State map called Ice Lock Empire State. This map will only be around for a limited time, but it swaps out the standard map with frozen streets and other examples of cold and hazardous weather.</p><p>The new map will also have a themed event mode, allowing you to play Domination, Conquest, and Gauntlet mission variations that utilize the new ""Freeze"" mechanic. Players will also be given access to the ice climbing axe through the Winter Offensive Bonus Path. Once they have the axe, players can unleash it as a melee weapon on unlucky foes. That bonus path also features an 11-tier, time-limited reward track featuring event cosmetics, and XP Boosters.</p><p>According to Battlefield Labs, the new update has ""a broad range of fixes and refinements across Battlefield 6."" Some of the improvements include weapon reliability, vehicle behavior, and quality-of-life bug fixes. You can find the complete notes for this update below.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-adds-winter-offensive-and-limited-time-multiplayer-event/1100-6536745/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-08T03:47:02.295491
Fallout's Ella Purnell Shoots Down Potential Romance For Lucy,"<p>Fallout Season 2 is just around the corner, and Amazon Prime Video has largely kept this season's storyline a secret. But there's one thing we can be reasonably certain about: Ella Purnell's Lucy won't be having a romance with Walton Goggins' Ghoul now or ever.</p><p>During an interview with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWqxIs7dpx0&amp;t=249s"">Geek Culture</a>, Purnell was with Goggins and Aaron Moten when she shot down the very idea of a love affair between Lucy and the Ghoul.</p><p>""Here's what I would say: you guys need therapy,"" said Purnell. ""You can't fix him. You can't save him. Let it go. Let it go, hon.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallouts-ella-purnell-shoots-down-potential-romance-for-lucy/1100-6536744/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-08T03:47:02.295491

"Path Of Exile 2's Next Update Lets Players Transform Into Wolves, Bears, And Wyverns","<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/"">Path of Exile 2</a> players won't have to wait long for the next update. The Last of the Druids is arriving on December 12, and it's putting more than just the magic of the Druids at your command. Players will soon be able to transform their Druids into a wolf, a bear, or even a dragon-like wyvern. The teaser trailer below demonstrates the powers that each new form has to offer.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUsjULYd2q8"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HUsjULYd2q8"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>The Druid's ability to transform is tied to one of three different talismans. As a wolf, players can summon a pack to attack enemies or rip adversaries to shreds with their own teeth and claws. Bears are raw power personified, and they can increase their strength through each roar they make. Becoming a wyvern grants the player the power of flight, as well lightning and fire attacks that can bring any adversary to their knees.</p><p>Even as a human, Druids have formidable abilities to fall back upon. They can command earth and storm elements, which put thunder and volcano attacks at their fingertips. There will be two paths for Druids to ascend to. As a Shaman, Druid magic and spells are amplified to a staggering degree. The Oracle may be the second ascendancy class for the Druids, but it grants players the foresight to predict enemy movements before they happen. Using those visions of the future in battle sounds like it could be very useful.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2s-next-update-lets-players-transform-into-wolves-bears-and-wyverns/1100-6536740/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-08T03:47:02.295491

This Game Awards Teaser Just Keeps Getting More And More Puzzling,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/"">The Game Awards</a> are coming up soon, and now host and organizer Geoff Keighley is hyping the event with some kind of real-world teaser campaign for something people believe is connected to Diablo. Others do not believe it is connected to Diablo. Some think it's for the next God of War game. Still others think it could be for The Elder Scrolls 6 or Lords of the Fallen 2. All of these suggestions may be wrong, however.</p><p>On November 28, Keighley posted the tex ""regal.inspiring.thickness"" along with an image of some kind of huge carving featuring humanoid people in the middle of a desert. On November 29, Keighley followed up with a <a href=""https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1994816833464217796"">Google Maps image</a> showing the location of the marketing monolith in the California desert. People quickly found the spot and posted images and video, including the ones below.

Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's Ending Does Samus Dirty (Spoilers),"<p dir=""ltr"">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is intended as both a continuation and a new start for the long dormant franchise. Though Nintendo has never quite said it overtly, it has seemed likely that this is meant to launch a new series of Prime games--possibly even a second trilogy, for the sake of dramatic rhyme. And the ending of Prime 4 accents that feeling, leaving the door wide open for more story--but in the process, diminishing the character of protagonist Samus Aran.</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Spoilers for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond follow.</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">As many eager Metroid fans know from preview coverage and reviews, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond features a wide cast of Federation characters, who have been stranded on Viewros with Samus. As you explore the corners of Sol Valley you eventually meet five in total: engineer Myles MacKenzie, sniper Reger Tokabi, Sergeant Ezra Duke, Private Nora Armstrong, and mech unit VUE-995. Each talks with Samus and relates to her in different ways. Myles is out of his element and needs Samus' rescue. Armstrong is a bona fide Samus superfan. Tokabi opens up to her about his religion and upbringing.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyonds-ending-does-samus-dirty-spoilers/1100-6536738/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-08T03:47:02.295491
A $5 Million Gift From Sega Saved Nvidia,"<p>Nvidia today is the world's most valuable company with a market cap of more than $4 trillion, thanks in large part to the AI boom of the past few years. But Nvidia's success was far from guaranteed.</p><p>CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang recalled recently how a $5 million gift following a failed business deal with Sega gave the company the lifeline it needed at the time, allowing the fledgling company to stay in business and eventually become what it is today.</p><p>Appearing on the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hptKYix4X8&amp;t=5567s"">Joe Rogan Experience podcast</a>, Huang talked about how, back in the 1990s, he and his two co-founders were trying to drum up business for their start-up PC company. They traveled to Japan and pitched Sega management on the idea that Nvidia could build the company's Dreamcast console.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-5-million-gift-from-sega-saved-nvidia/1100-6536736/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-08T03:47:02.295491

"No Switch 2? Good News, Metroid Prime 4 Runs Pretty Well On Switch 1","<p dir=""ltr"">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond isn't a Switch 2 exclusive, but how it would run on the OG Switch has remained a mystery through its entire announcement and preview cycle. The preview coverage has consistently been running on Switch 2, and review codes were for the Switch 2 Edition, so many reviews including ours evaluated that version. Now that the game is out, though, we can put any lingering concerns to rest: The game plays smoothly on the original Switch.</p><p dir=""ltr"">For the purposes of this look at the game I replayed through the first two major sections: the tutorial mission with the assault on the Galactic Federation, and then the Fury Green portion on Viewros where Samus first starts to unlock her psychic abilities. Predictably, the Switch 1 version looks noticeably lower-quality than its Switch 2 counterpart, with less-detailed textures and lighting effects. It still looks decent, though, and compares favorably to the Metroid Prime Remaster that was released on Switch in 2023. Just know that you shouldn't go in expecting it to look quite as nice as the official trailers or other footage captured on a Switch 2.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Its performance, on the other hand, is very good. It doesn't offer a Quality or Performance mode selection like it does on Switch 2, but the default settings run well, without noticeable framerate dips. Switch fans who have watched recent Nintendo games outpace the hardware's limitations, especially in the cases of some recent Pokemon and Zelda titles, can be assured that isn't the case here. In my limited testing, I didn't run into any hitches, and felt the smooth performance was roughly on par with my review experience on Switch 2. It's possible, of course, that later portions may overwhelm the system, but I haven't had any cause for concern so far.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-switch-2-good-news-metroid-prime-4-runs-pretty-well-on-switch-1/1100-6536733/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-08T03:47:02.295491
Don’t Expect Rainbow Six Siege 2--Creative Director Explains Why It's Not Happening Yet,"<p>Rainbow Six Siege celebrated its 10th anniversary this month, a milestone that many live-service games haven't come close to matching. The tactical shooter launched in 2015, and it has evolved into a major attraction at esports tournaments across the globe, reaching 85 million players to date.

Speaking to GameSpot, creative director Alexander Karpazis doesn't expect a sequel anytime soon, as Ubisoft aims to respect players' investment and keep the current game going for the foreseeable future.</p><p>""Honestly, I think there are tons of reasons against it, just like there are reasons for it,"" Karpazis said. ""But for us, it's about maintaining something that has been successful and competitive and fun for such a long time. We see it where players kind of get the rug pulled out from under them, and everything they've worked towards kind of changes in an instant when they jump over to a sequel. And that's something we don't want to do to our players. So there's an element of respecting players' investment. There's also an element of, this is an amazing legacy we're building--why would we want to throw that away?""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-expect-rainbow-six-siege-2-creative-director-explains-why-its-not-happening-yet/1100-6536724/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-08T03:47:02.295491
How Dave The Diver's New DLC Uses A Dash Of Animal Crossing To Shake Things Up,"<p dir=""ltr"">Dave the Diver is a modest game that has expanded like Dave's belt size. The underwater adventure and restaurant management sim mash-up was a surprise hit, and has since spawned crossover efforts with fishing game Dredge, the kaiju Godzilla, and even Ichiban Kasuga of the Like A Dragon series. Now the game is preparing to dive back in with the In The Jungle expansion in early 2026. The DLC will see Dave and his crew heading to a new freshwater biome and catching lake-dwelling creatures to make their dishes.

"20 Years Ago, Animal Crossing Finally Showed What It Could Be","<p dir=""ltr""><em>Animal Crossing: Wild World is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, December 5, 2025. Below, we look at how its modest pathing system laid the groundwork, so to speak, for what the series has become.</em></p><p dir=""ltr"">Animal Crossing has always balanced two fantasies: the joy of customizing a cozy little town and the simple pleasures of living among a cast of charming, slightly strange animal neighbors. Those two elements worked in tandem. Your creative expression shaped your village, but the daily routines of chatting with neighbors, fishing by the riverbank, and uncovering little surprises gave the world its soul.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Somewhere along the way, however, customization did not just complement village life--it began to overshadow it. And if you trace that shift back through the franchises' history, the turning point can be found within 2005's Animal Crossing: Wild World.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/20-years-ago-animal-crossing-finally-showed-what-it-could-be/1100-6536728/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-08T03:47:02.295491

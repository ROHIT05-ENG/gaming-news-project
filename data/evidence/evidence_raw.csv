Starting on December 18, players will be to put presents under their tree--so to speak--by clobbering creatures for loot and bringing a little hope back to Estuar.</p><p>To claim their prizes, players will have to face hordes of Treasure Goblins and earn their place on the March of the Goblins reputation board. There are multiple tiers to unlock, and players can claim their prizes between each one by visiting the Goblin Square in Kyovashad. Once players complete the final tier, they will be given a Resplendent Spark. That final tier is repeatable, and the quality of the loot dropped by enemies will increase with each tier. However, players will only have until January 6, 2026 to work their way through and claim as much treasure as they can.</p><p>Returning Grim Favors during Goblin Greedings will also give players an additional cache for Gift of the Tree. All they need to do to claim it is to select a cache, which will reveal the treasure they've been given by the Gift of the Tree.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-goblin-greedings-lets-you-beat-up-goblins-for-more-loot/1100-6537036/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-17T03:44:33.258500

The list of possible games also includes the strategy game SteamWorld Build as another pick, in case you want to load up on even more of the series.</p><p>With season 2 of the Fallout TV show looming, now's the perfect time to explore the open-world RPGs that inspired the show with Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition and Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition. Both are available as part of the Best of Platinum Collection. These versions include the full base games plus every update, add-on, and DLC expansion. You can round out the selection with Fallout 76, which is an online multiplayer take on the series--though it still offers the same open-ended, first-person exploration and RPG gameplay as the other games. It also recently received a new Burning Springs DLC update that ties into the Amazon Prime Video streaming series.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-22-games-for-under-65-at-fanatical/1100-6536985/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-17T03:44:33.258500

As such, you'll want to bring an augment with a safe pocket so that you don't accidentally lose this key during your journey to Pilgrim's Peak. If you do lose it, you'll have to wait to find another one (which is entirely random) or just hope you can catch the door open from someone else's key at some point.</p><p>When you're ready to complete the Groundbreaking quest, read on.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-groundbreaking-quest-guide/1100-6537035/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-17T03:44:33.258500

"Steam Replay 2025 Is Now Live, Letting Players Look Back At Their Gaming Year","<p>Steam Replay for 2025 is now available, giving players a fun way to look back at their year in gaming. It shows what games you played, how much time you spent playing, and other simple stats from the year. Many platforms now do yearly summaries like this, with Spotify Wrapped starting the trend, and services like YouTube and Twitch followed by showing users what they watched and enjoyed in 2025.</p><p>Valve's Steam Replay covers your playtime from January 1, 2025, through the end of December 14, 2025. This gives players a clear picture of most of their gaming year, and also focuses on their habits--such as how many games they played games with either a keyboard or controller--and highlights their most-played games. This year, I finally really got into games on Steam with Peak and Repo, and I'm still dabbling with Lethal Company.</p><div data-embed-type=""tweet"" data-src=""https://twitter.com/Steam/status/2001013695598747896"" data-has-image=""true""><blockquote align=""center"" class=""twitter-tweet"" data-conversation=""none"" data-mce-disable-toolbar=""true""><p dir=""ltr"">It's the most wonderful time of the year - Steam Replay 2025 is now available!<br /><br />Take a trip down memory lane and see how many games you played, how much you played per month, and many more fun stats for the year.<br /><br />Check out yours (login required): <a href=""https://t.co/Zq9vxaFit4"">https://t.co/Zq9vxaFit4</a>… <a href=""https://t.co/SrVS9oNdIP"">pic.twitter.com/SrVS9oNdIP</a></p>  — Steam (@Steam) <a href=""https://twitter.com/Steam/status/2001013695598747896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote>          <text></text>    </div><p>Other gaming platforms have also released their yearly summaries, as <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-2025-wrap-up-see-how-much-you-played-this-year/1100-6536799/"">PlayStation posted its yearly wrap-up last week.</a> To see your Steam Replay, you can visit Valve's website or <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/login/?redir=replay%2F%3Fsnr%3D1_4_4__118%26snr%3D1_4_4__118&amp;redir_ssl=1"">click the Steam Replay banner</a> in the Steam app's store page.

Arc Raiders The Stench Of Corruption Quest Guide,"<p>If you've come across The Stench of Corruption quest in <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a>, you may be wondering how to find and complete each of its objectives. It can be challenging to round up each location you need to visit, after all, and find out exactly what to interact with in each spot. Luckily, we've got you covered below.</p><p>Keep in mind that you need to complete every step of this quest in a single round. This means that dying before you wrap things up will result in you having to redo the steps next time you load in. However, you do not need to extract to get credit for completion, so once you've finished the quest, dying won't be as big of a deal. We'd still recommend you try to extract, though, of course.</p><p>When you're ready to knock out The Stench of Corruption, follow the steps below.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-the-stench-of-corruption-quest-guide/1100-6537027/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-17T03:44:33.258500
"The Majority Of Bethesda Is Working On The Elder Scrolls 6, But It Could Overlap With Other Projects","<p>In January 2026, it will be seven and a half years since the announcement teaser for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi/"">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>. In that time, Bethesda has had remarkably little to say about it or even a trailer to show off. Now, Bethesda's Todd Howard has indicated that most of the Bethesda team is working on The Elder Scrolls 6.</p><p>""It's progressing really well,"" Howard told <a href=""https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development"">Game Informer</a>. ""The majority of the studio's on [Elder Scrolls 6]. but I'll say this: We always overlap. So, we're very used to overlapping development. And we have long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them. And it's a process. We all wish it went a little bit faster--or a lot faster--but it's a process that we want to get right.""</p><p>Although the initial announcement came years ago, it's possible or even likely that development didn't ramp up on The Elder Scrolls until after <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/"">Starfield</a> was released in 2023.

"How Total War: Warhammer 40K's Factions Will Be ""Totally Different"" From Past Games","<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/total-war-warhammer-40000/"">Total War: Warhammer 40,000's</a> four asymmetrical factions will vary wildly from one another, as developer Creative Assembly has now outlined how some of the game's factions will play and be ""totally different"" from factions seen before in the Total War franchise.</p><p dir=""ltr"">After being announced during <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/"">The Game Awards</a>, more details about developer Creative Assembly's next game have been revealed via a new developer roundtable. The four factions players will have to choose from include Space Marines, Astra Militarum, Orks, and Aeldari. Mann said the universe has a lot of opportunities for asymmetry between the factions, and Creative Assembly knew that it could only pick a limited number of playable factions in order to give each one the amount of effort to make them feel special.</p><p dir=""ltr"">In terms of how they play, each faction will field troops, gather resources, and engage in battle in different ways. Of the four factions, Astra Milatrum is said to be the most ""traditional"" Total War faction, with mass ranks of infantry and support from artillery and vehicles. Like in other Total War games, Astra Militarum players will need to gather resources, build infrastructure, and recruit more troops in order to succeed. In true Astra Militarum fashion, solving problems will often mean throwing more masses of bodies at it.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-total-war-warhammer-40ks-factions-will-be-totally-different-from-past-games/1100-6537024/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-17T03:44:33.258500

Activision Is Trying Really Hard To Get You To Play Black Ops 7 Right Now,"<p>Activision has made a couple of announcements that seem to suggest the company is trying extra hard to encourage people to buy and play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p><p>For starters, Activision has launched a new week-long free trial for Black Ops 7's multiplayer mode. In the free trial, which runs December 16-22, players can access 20+ maps and try the Ashes of the Damned map for Zombies. In terms of modes, players can try out mainstays like Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, Domination, and Kill Confirmed, as well as the Holiday Havoc mode and Prop Hunt.</p><p>Alongside this, Activision has discounted Black Ops 7 by up to 30%. This brings the price down to from $70 to $49 for the standard edition, or from $100 to $80 for the Vault Edition.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-is-trying-really-hard-to-get-you-to-play-black-ops-7-right-now/1100-6537022/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-17T03:44:33.258500
Baldur's Gate Boss Wanted One Very Specific Thing Cut From Divinity: Original Sin 2's Re-Release,"<p>Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian just recently launched its acclaimed previous game, Divinity: Original Sin II, on Switch 2, and studio boss Swen Vincke said he tried hard to cut one element in particular for the new release.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=""https://mein-mmo.de/en/larian-ceo-swen-vincke-in-interview-i-hate-the-squirrel-and-the-great-freedom-for-divinity-after-baldurs-gate-3,1542810/"">Mein-MMO</a>, Vincke responded to the interviewer saying they are a big fan of the game's squirrel NPC, <a href=""https://divinityoriginalsin2.wiki.fextralife.com/Sir+Lora"">Sir Lora</a>.

How To Get The Free Arc Raiders Red Ryder Skin,"<p>Embark Studios is giving <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a> players a reason to jump into its free-to-play title, The Finals, by introducing a fresh color for the Ryder outfit that can only be earned by playing a few matches of the popular first-person shooter. This new color for the Ryder outfit is a good-looking option for anyone who wants to stand out with a bold and aggressive vibe, so fans of Arc Raiders will likely want to hop into The Finals and snag this one. Here's how to make it happen.</p><h2>How to get the Red Ryder skin in Arc Raiders</h2><p>To get the red color for the Ryder outfit in Arc Raiders, <strong>you'll simply need to play three matches of The Finals</strong>. Yes, it really is that easy--though you'll obviously need to have downloaded and installed The Finals to get things started. Thankfully, it's a free-to-play game, though if you've not played it before, you'll first be prompted to complete a short tutorial. In all, completing this challenge should take you about 1-2 hours at most.</p><p>Do note that you'll want to be absolutely certain that you're logged into the same <a href=""https://id.embark.games/id/sign-in"">Embark ID</a> for both Arc Raiders and The Finals. With these linked together, completing those three matches of The Finals will automatically grant you the Red Ryder skin shortly thereafter in Arc Raiders--<strong>it took exactly one hour for it to show up in my inbox in Arc Raiders.</strong></p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-the-free-arc-raid-red-ryder-skin/1100-6537021/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-17T03:44:33.258500
Arc Raiders Paving The Way Quest Guide,"<p>If you've come across the Paving the Way quest in <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a>, you're likely looking for an ENELICA building or wondering where to find some research notes. You've come to the right place, as we've got each step of Paving the Way listed out for you below. Just be aware that this quest requires you to visit two separate maps, so it's going to take a bit of time and effort to wrap it up.</p><p>You'll want to try to extract from each map when you've completed the necessary steps there, but rest assured that dying won't reset your progress. As such, we'd recommend you not bring in all of your best gear, as there are likely to be a lot of folks around questing, too, and you don't want to risk losing anything valuable.</p><p>When you're ready to complete Paving the Way, follow the steps below.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-paving-the-way-quest-guide/1100-6537026/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-17T03:44:33.258500

The service offers comprehensive courses in 25 languages, all of which use a unique immersion learning style, making it one of the most effective language learning programs out there. Of course, as with any language-learning program, the trick is to stick with it--luckily, Rosetta Stone is offering <strong>a limited-time discount on lifetime subscriptions</strong>, dropping the price to<strong> just $149 (was $400)</strong>, which could make it much easier to commit to the process.</p><p>While the Lifetime Subscription is arguably the best deal, it's not the only Rosetta Stone discount.

While the Lifetime Plan includes all 25 languages (listed below), monthly plans only unlock a single language--making the lifetime subscription by far the best deal. All plans offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. Rosetta Stone also lets you gift plans to others, which could make this deal a fun holiday gift.

How Horses' Ban Reflects The Gaming Industry's Double Standards And Emotional Immaturity,"<p dir=""ltr"">A tectonic shift in the political climate has given rise to a sharp increase in authoritarian practices and policies and made 2025 an unprecedented and disconcerting year for censorship, including for the video game industry. In the face of outstanding pressure on the payment processors powering storefronts like <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-updated-guidelines-allow-banks-to-enforce-standards-on-adult-only-content/1100-6533253/"">Steam</a> and <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/"">Itch</a>, thousands of games--largely pertaining to adult subject matter that was sexual in nature and labeled NSFW--were either removed or deindexed from those respective stores. Though the uproar around these removals died down with time--partly due to loss of momentum pressuring these stores to rescind the bans, partly because certain free games were eventually reindexed on Itch--the recent release of Santa Ragione's Horses has brought the conversation back for another round before year's end.</p><p dir=""ltr"">That's because, once again, a title with a significant amount of adult content (seriously, Horses fits a lot of taboo material into a fairly brief runtime) has found itself in the crosshairs of the ongoing puritanical culture war that's raging throughout the country, as well as in the world of video games. And as it continues, the controversy around certain games and their subject matter begins to raise questions about artistic expression, who in this medium is allowed to discuss and prominently feature adult-oriented content, and what kind of conversations and explorations of these subjects will the corporate powers in control of the industry permit.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Horses is a notable development in this ongoing controversy for several reasons, not the least of which is the preventative measures taken against it. Whereas the bulk of the censorship mentioned here came well after games were released and available to play, affecting many games that had already been listed on these stores for some time, Horses has been facing an uphill battle leading to its release on December 2.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-horses-ban-reflects-the-gaming-industrys-double-standards-and-emotional-immaturity/1100-6537012/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-17T03:44:33.258500

It's Almost Annoying How Fun Splitgate 2 Was,"<p dir=""ltr"">Shooters are having a moment in 2025, with Battlefield 6 and <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-on-an-upward-arc-surpassing-helldivers-2-all-time-peak-concurrent-players-on-steam/1100-6536086/"">Arc Raiders topping the charts</a> and attracting large player counts as the year comes to an end. The former title is a return to form for a legacy franchise, while the latter leads the charge for the fledgling extraction-shooter genre.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Left in the dust in the shooter space, however, is Splitgate 2, a game that its makers thought would revitalize a genre they saw as growing stale. Developer 1047 Games released the first-person shooter in May, exuding extreme confidence in its product. Splitgate 2 tried to bank on nostalgia for old-school arena shooters, directly invoking Halo and even Titanfall. Yet, the game was also marred by contradictory decisions, adapting present-day monetization models and industry-wide fads like battle royale modes.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Splitgate 2 is a blip in the big picture of 2025, but the issues and drama surrounding the title and its release were so prolific that the game is certain to be the subject of YouTube essays and analysis for years to come.

"How The Expedition Works In Arc Raiders: Rewards, Requirements, And More","<p>The month of December is a busy one for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a>. The major highlight of the month is the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-the-arc-raiders-cold-snap-update/2900-7344/"">Cold Snap update</a>, which introduces a slew of content to the game and balancing fixes across the board.

"Divinity's Lack Of Tabletop DNA Could Help It Surpass Baldur's Gate 3, Larian Says","<p>Baldur's Gate 3 has built a reputation as one of the best role-playing games ever made since it released a few years ago, and with Divinity, Larian certainly seems confident it can make something even better. But how can it be so sure? <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-larian-ceo-swen-vincke/1100-6536981/"">Speaking to GameSpot</a>, CEO Swen Vincke explained that the D&amp;D tabletop roots of Baldur's Gate 3 could actually make things more difficult.</p><p>""One of the biggest struggles that we had with Baldur's Gate 3 is every single class has almost different rulesets, so getting players on board with that was quite complicated,"" Vincke told us.</p><p>While those with D&amp;D experience (or a similar game like <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-video-game-taught-me-dungeons-and-dragons-so-my-friends-didnt-have-to/1100-6510365/"">Solasta</a>) may have felt like they were ready for Baldur's Gate 3 at launch, it does feature a number of class-unique mechanics that people have to learn.

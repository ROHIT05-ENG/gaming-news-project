The company was instrumental in the creation of a variety of titles, including <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/yaiba-ninja-gaiden-z/"">Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z</a>, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/soul-sacrifice/"">Soul Sacrifice</a>, and <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/recore/"">ReCore</a>. By far its most well-known title was <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/mighty-no-9/"">Mighty No. 9</a>, a crowdfunded attempt to modernize and revive the platforming conventions of the classic Mega Man games that wound up fraught with controversy and production issues, releasing to a mixed reception.</p><p>After the failure of a subsequent Kickstarter for the adventure game Red Ash, the cancellation of 3DS action title <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/kaiou-king-of-pirates/"">Kaio: King of Pirates</a>, and the speedy end-of-service for its online mobile game Dragon &amp; Colonies, Comcept was acquired by prominent Japanese game developer Level-5 and renamed Level-5 Comcept.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/comcept-the-studio-behind-mighty-no-9-and-recore-shuts-down/1100-6537781/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-30T01:02:30.422376
Richer Households Now Make Up The Majority Of Gaming Hardware Buyers,"<p>Some new eye-opening data from Circana demonstrates the impacts of gaming hardware getting more expensive, as over half the households who bought gaming hardware recently made $100,000 or more a year.</p><p>More specifically, a post from Circana's Senior Director Mat Piscatella on <a href=""https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mdktpcl2a22v"">Bluesky</a> revealed that 53% of households who bought new video game hardware, like the Nintendo Switch 2 or PS5 Pro, in Q4 2025 made more than $100,000 annually. In Q1 2022, only 40% of buyers were above that threshold.</p><p>Conversely, poorer households are <a href=""https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mdktuve7es2v"">buying less gaming hardware</a>, as those making under $50,000 a year were just 19% of the buyers in Q4 2025, but they were 31% of the consumer base in Q1 2022. Essentially, this data shows that majority of consumers buying new hardware are from a smaller, richer base.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/richer-households-now-make-up-the-majority-of-gaming-hardware-buyers/1100-6537779/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-30T01:02:30.422376

Plenty of movies <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/video-game-movies-in-the-works/2900-5059/"">get announced but never materialize</a>, for any number of reasons.

Nintendo Issues Correction Over Leaked Nintendo Switch Online GameCube Games,"<p>A Walmart advertisement showing two unannounced GameCube games coming to Nintendo Switch Online was actually a mistake from Nintendo itself, and the two titles aren't planned for the service as of yet.</p><p>After Walmart's Nintendo page displayed a <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-online-leak-might-rule-out-a-highly-requested-gamecube-remaster/1100-6537674/"">graphic including Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a> and Pikmin 2, a Nintendo of America spokesperson told <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-looks-to-have-leaked-two-nintendo-switch-online-gamecube-classics-and-some-fans-think-its-now-over-for-a-metroid-prime-2-remake"">IGN</a> that it ""provided a retailer with an image of Nintendo GameCube -- Nintendo Classics titles that incorrectly included games that are not planned for release at this time."" The image has since been removed.</p><p>The error on Nintendo's part is somewhat surprising, considering how airtight the company's marketing usually is.

Like the DualSense controller above, this model has a bright white finish, accentuated by several elements of Marathon's graphic design.</p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://sonyps.prf.hn/click/camref:1110l56fv/pubref:subid_value/destination:https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/pulse-elite-wireless-headset-marathon-limited-edition-ps5"">Preorder at PlayStation Direct</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>   </div> </div><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4637624-marathondualsense%286%29.jpg"" data-ref-id=""1300-4637624"" data-ratio=""0.5625"" data-width=""1280"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 1280px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4637624-marathondualsense%286%29.jpg""><img alt=""Marathon DualSense controller"" src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4637624-marathondualsense%286%29.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4637624-marathondualsense%286%29.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1601/16018044/4637624-marathondualsense%286%29.jpg 480w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"" data-width=""1280""></a><figcaption>Marathon DualSense controller</figcaption></figure><figure data-embed-type=""gallery"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4637627-marathondualsense%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4637628-marathondualsense%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4637629-marathondualsense%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4637630-marathondualsense%284%29.jpg"" data-ref-id=""1300-4637627,1300-4637628,1300-4637629,1300-4637630"" data-resize-urls=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4637627-marathondualsense%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4637628-marathondualsense%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4637629-marathondualsense%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4637630-marathondualsense%284%29.jpg""><div class=""image-gallery__label"">Gallery</div>   <div class=""image-gallery__list hide-scrollbar image-gallery__list--small"">       <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4637627-marathondualsense%281%29.jpg"">       <img src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4637627-marathondualsense%281%29.jpg"" alt=""Gallery image 1"" data-full-srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4637627-marathondualsense%281%29.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1601/16018044/4637627-marathondualsense%281%29.jpg 480w"" />     </a>       <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4637628-marathondualsense%282%29.jpg"">       <img src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4637628-marathondualsense%282%29.jpg"" alt=""Gallery image 2"" data-full-srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4637628-marathondualsense%282%29.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1601/16018044/4637628-marathondualsense%282%29.jpg 480w"" />     </a>       <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4637629-marathondualsense%283%29.jpg"">       <img src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4637629-marathondualsense%283%29.jpg"" alt=""Gallery image 3"" data-full-srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4637629-marathondualsense%283%29.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1601/16018044/4637629-marathondualsense%283%29.jpg 480w"" />     </a>       <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4637630-marathondualsense%284%29.jpg"">       <img src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4637630-marathondualsense%284%29.jpg"" alt=""Gallery image 4"" data-full-srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4637630-marathondualsense%284%29.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1601/16018044/4637630-marathondualsense%284%29.jpg 480w"" />     </a>   </div>  </figure><p> </p><p>If you're looking to pick up Marathon ahead of its March 5 launch, digital preorders for the game are now live on all platforms in standard and Deluxe Editions.

It Seems Developers Don't Want To Make Xbox Games Much Anymore,"<p>Game developers are continuing to prefer working on games for PC and PlayStation 5 over Xbox Series X|S, according to new data from the Game Developers Conference's latest report tracking the state of the games industry over the last year.</p><p>The latest report from GDC (via <a href=""https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/is-this-make-or-break-for-gdc"">Christopher Dring at The Game Business</a>) showed a continued decline in developers working on projects for Xbox. While PC remains the one platform to rule them all, with 83% of surveyed developers currently making games for it and 80% saying they want to, developers are making games for PlayStation 5 at a seven-percentage-point difference over Xbox Series X|S. (47% versus 40%, to be exact.) This difference extends to developer interest as well, with 40% of surveyors saying they want to work on PS5 projects compared to just 20% for Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>The Steam Deck, meanwhile, is apparently the fourth-most-used platform, as 28% of developers are making or optimizing games for Valve's handheld console. Speaking of handheld consoles, 39% of participants say they're interested in making games for the Nintendo Switch 2, putting it just one percentage point behind the Steam Deck in terms of developer interest (40%).</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-seems-developers-dont-want-to-make-xbox-games-much-anymore/1100-6537776/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-30T01:02:30.422376

Crimson Desert Features Multiple Playable Characters And A Missile-Firing Mech,"<p>Ahead of <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/crimson-desert/"">Crimson Desert</a>'s March 19 launch, developer Pearl Abyss has shared a 15-minute features-overview video detailing some of what you can expect in the open-world action-adventure game. This includes a grappling hook, a mountable dragon, a pilotable mech to wreak some havoc, and two more playable characters.</p><p>The features-overview video went over primary protagonist Kliff's journey of saving the world of Pywel, a medieval-fantasy continent that is embroiled in conflict from political and supernatural forces. Over the course of 15 minutes, Pearl Abyss showcased just a few elements of the game, like the two additional playable characters that will accompany Kliff on his expedition. We don't meet them, so we don't know their names or their lore, but they look rather fascinating, and the studio said each of the playable characters has their own skills, combat styles, and weapons. One is a swift female warrior with a gigantic sword (claymore style) who appears to wield a flintlock pistol. The other is a bruising male tank using some sort of Barret-like arm cannon and a massive axe.</p><p>Later in the video, we can see Kliff traversing the massive open-world with multiple mid-air jumps, a grappling hook to latch onto and swing from ledges, a huge dragon to ""soar high above"" Pywel, and a missile-firing mech so you can blow a bunch of stuff up instead of just swinging your sword and RKO-ing enemies to oblivion.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crimson-desert-features-multiple-playable-characters-and-a-missile-firing-mech/1100-6537772/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-30T01:02:30.422376
Abide Is A First-Person Horror Game Made With Stop-Motion Animation,"<p>There's no shortage of mystery games on Steam, but developer Talha &amp; Jack Co is aiming to put a handcrafted--and gruesome--feel on that genre with its next title, Abide. The duo behind games like Judero and Mashina has revealed its grisly new mystery game, which uses traditionally animated dolls and prosthetic gore effects to tell a stomach-churning narrative that looks heavily inspired by Italian Giallo thrillers. You can check out the reveal trailer below.</p><p>Set in the secluded, supposedly idyllic St Boniface Retreat, Abide will see players explore a community experimenting with new therapeutic techniques for its residents. At night, monsters and other horrors lurk outside the walls of the rehabilitation center, and players can push their luck by venturing out from relative safety to encounter these threats. That day/night cycle will create two distinct experiences: Investigations and relationship-building exercises will unfold during daylight hours, while the night brings mystery, intrigue, and psychological horror.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqO7smpntMQ"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tqO7smpntMQ"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Players will choose who to spend their time with as they build trust with several eccentric characters, and choices made during the adventure will have tangible effects on the world around them. That sense of realism is reflected in the design of the characters, as each one has been meticulously handcrafted using ball-jointed art doll-techniques, painted with modelling acrylics, and brought to life by a talented voice actor.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/abide-is-a-first-person-horror-game-made-with-stop-motion-animation/1100-6537766/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-30T01:02:30.422376

Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream Lets You Have A Love Square With A Clown Because Why Not?,"<p>Nintendo dropped a 22-minute Direct presentation for the upcoming social-life sim <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream/"">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>, which revealed all kinds of fun and fascinating features for the Switch-exclusive.

One of the main Miis in the trailer, Angie, admits to us that she ""can't hold back"" her feelings for the clown and ""needs to tell him"" how she feels. The player encourages Angie, suggesting she ""go for it."" Which she does! She invites Hugh on a Ferris wheel date, where she confesses her feelings ""the old-fashioned way."" That is, stuttering through rosy cheeks and nervous breaths.</p><p>Morris, oblivious, says he's ""totally in love with the view"" from inside the Ferris wheel, too. Angie clarifies what she meant, blurting out that she's ""in love"" with him and asks to go on a real date. As hearts pound in the background, a Mii named Jess somehow enters the Ferris wheel and professes that the one who ""truly loves"" Morris is them.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-lets-you-have-a-love-square-with-a-clown-because-why-not/1100-6537767/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-30T01:02:30.422376
Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream Adds Same-Sex Relationships And Non-Binary Miis,"<p>More than 10 years after vowing to make a ""more inclusive"" Tomodachi Life game, Nintendo has made good on that promise, revealing in a Nintendo Direct that Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream will add not only same-sex romances, but the option to make non-binary Mii characters.</p><p>The 22-minute Direct for the Switch game demonstrated the character creation process for Miis, which includes three gender options: Male, Female, and Non-Binary. Additionally, players can pick any (or none) of the three options for their character's dating preferences.</p><p>When the previous entry in the wacky Tomodachi Life series, released in 2013 for Nintendo 3DS, lacked the option for same-sex relationships, a social media campaign called Miiquality called on Nintendo to include the option in the game. <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-explains-why-it-won-t-allow-same-sex-relationships-in-tomodachi-life/1100-6419489/"">Nintendo of America responded with a rather cold statement</a>, saying that the game ""was intended to be a whimsical and quirky game"" that was ""absolutely not trying to provide social commentary.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-adds-same-sex-relationships-and-non-binary-miis/1100-6537765/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-30T01:02:30.422376

In the post, Barone explains that he's been very productive on Haunted Chocolatier lately, and that the game is taking longer to bring together than expected. He concedes that it was likely announced too early, with the first trailer debuting in 2021, but that he had reasons for making that call, too.</p><p>Taking aim at a handful of recent rumors, Barone shut down the insinuation Haunted Chocolatier would be canceled and have its content added to Stardew Valley, or that mechanics for the new game were being tested in Stardew Valley updates. ""Also, Stardew Valley is a different game, so you can’t really “test something” for Haunted Chocolatier in it in an accurate way,"" he added.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/haunted-chocolatier-progress-isnt-being-affected-by-stardew-valley-updates-creator-says/1100-6537764/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-30T01:02:30.422376

Gans described this cut as longer and allowing the story more room to breathe, but he was instructed by his producers to trim the movie down to two hours.

Fortnite X South Park Quests: How To Solve Kenny's Mystery Quests,"<p>During Fortnite Chapter 6, most every cosmetic you could unlock from a pass or for free was earned simply by gaining XP in any mode. But Epic has returned to the old ways in Chapter 7, with unlockable cosmetics that require completing specific quests. Case in point is the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-x-south-park-all-skins-and-free-event-pass-rewards/2900-7396/"">Born in Chaos mini pass</a> for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-x-south-park-all-skins-rewards-map-changes-and-new-gameplay-items/2900-7391/"">Fortnite's new South Park crossover</a>, which comes with a series of quests that you'll need to complete in order to unlock the otherwise-free cosmetics. And with the latest batch of quests, that task got a little bit more difficult since you cannot actually read what Kenny's quests are--similar to how his dialogue on the show is muffled and inaudible.</p><p>That means that if you want to get those Terrance and Phillip doll pickaxes, you'll actually need to pay attention to these quests. Some of them you'll certainly complete by accident if you play Fortnite regularly, but others will require a bit of conscious effort. And we'll make it just a smidge easier by handling the thinking part for you--which is to say that we'll explain each quest in detail below.</p><p>All of these quests must be completed in Battle Royale or Zero Build, and they provide pass progress only. The quests themselves don't offer XP directly, but there are three level skips you can unlock as you progress the event pass, and you can already earn one of them (worth 80,000 XP) by completing five quests. Completing four quests from a batch will award a Memberberry--collecting six Memberberries awards the Imaginationland Airship glider.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-x-south-park-quests-how-to-ride-5-rides-at-cartmanland-and-complete-every-quest/1100-6537301/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-26T00:59:13.463084

For something even smaller, there are the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/MS-PAC-Man-Joystick-Player-3-5-Display/dp/B0CT6RHM5T?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Ms. Pac-Man</a> and <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Arcade-Galaga-Joystick-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0F7VJV2SF?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Galaga Joystick Players</a> for $50-$60, and Micro Players based on Capcom IP like Street Fighter and Mega Man.</p><p>You can also grab one of My Arcade's popular retro handhelds at a great price. These are themed around classic video game franchises, and they pack a ton of games into a pocket-friendly device that are equipped with 2.75-inch color displays. The Pocket Player Pro can be recharged via USB-C or powered by four AA batteries, and one of the best value-for-money models here is the <a href=""http://amazon.com/dp/B0BT3XY8XG?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Atari Pocket Player Pro</a> that comes preloaded with 100 classic games.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-arcade-sonic-the-hedgehog-mighty-player-limited-time-deal/1100-6537568/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-26T00:59:13.463084

You'll start with little more than a campfire and a sleeping bag on your property, before growing your land into something more impressive. From adding shops in town to beautifying your land with flowers and windmills, there are countless ways to develop your version of the Outback. You'll also get to hunt wild animals, venture out to gather rare resources, and greet new visitors as they visit your ever-expanding home.</p><p>While the game doesn't have many critic reviews, it has over 15,000 user reviews on <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062520/Dinkum/"">Steam</a> and a rating of ""Very Positive."" Speaking of Steam, the game is only $20 on Valve's online shop--so give it a look if you want to save a few bucks. It's listed as ""Playable"" on Steam Deck, too.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dinkum-nintendo-switch-physical-edition-preorder/1100-6537573/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-26T00:59:13.463084

I Hope Double Fine Keeps Getting To Make Weird Games Forever,"<p dir=""ltr"">Xbox delivered the first big showcase of the year with its <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-developer-direct-2026-all-the-big-announcements/2900-7421/"">Developer Direct</a>, and amid rumors that the event would highlight three of its <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/whats-next-for-xbox-in-2026-games-hardware-and-game-pass/2900-7422/"">most-anticipated games</a>, there was plenty of speculation that it would also show off a secret fourth game as well. That speculation proved correct, as the showcase offered the first formal and lengthy preview of Kiln, the next game from Double Fine. The madcap party game is coming sometime this spring, and while we'll have to see how it turns out, the presentation itself stood out as a testament to the qualities that make Double Fine so special in this industry.</p><p dir=""ltr"">This wasn't quite a debut for Kiln, which has been known about and in development for years. In fact, the excellent <a href=""https://www.doublefine.com/dftv/psychodyssey"">Double Fine documentary Psychodyssey</a> had an episode devoted to its Amnesia Fortnight, the internal game jam exercise where Double Fine has cooked up some of its greatest ideas. That episode happened to capture the birth of Kiln, years ago now, showing just how long it takes a game to go from inception to release.</p><p dir=""ltr"">(If you haven't watched the sprawling documentary series yet, you certainly should. It's quite simply one of the best deep-dives on game development, with all the humor and heart and human drama that comes with an intimate look inside a group of creative people.)</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-hope-double-fine-keeps-getting-to-make-weird-games-forever/1100-6537619/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-26T00:59:13.463084
Highguard Devs Will Break Silence With Launch-Day Stream,"<p>Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards wrapped up on December 11, 2025, with a strange ""one more thing"" announcement: <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/highguard/"">Highguard</a>, the free-to-play PvP raid shooter that launches in just a few days. It has been six weeks since then, though, and developer Wildlight Entertainment went radio silent ... until now. The studio finally posted on social media on January 23, revealing that a livestream will fully detail the game on January 26, the same day Highguard arrives on consoles and PC.</p><p>As <a href=""https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2014760310046085443"">the studio announced on X</a>, the launch showcase will go live on Monday, January 26, at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET. During the livestream, Wildlight Entertainment will share ""an in-depth look at Highguard"" with a full gameplay deep dive, a look at year-one plans, and more. You can <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qR9Xbzt5t0"">catch the broadcast</a> on Highguard's YouTube channel.</p><h2>Highguard Goes Missing</h2><p>And ... that's it, for now. Wildlight Entertainment hasn't said anything else and hasn't responded to any replies to its X post as of this writing, so we'll all have to wait until January 26 to hear more about this bizarre TGA closer. Again, in case you weren't paying attention, that's the same day that Highguard comes out. Strange marketing.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/highguard-devs-will-break-silence-with-launch-day-stream/1100-6537620/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-26T00:59:13.463084

It's essentially Warhammer 40,000 meets Halo, even down to the detailed sculpted minis--though, thankfully, Halo: Flashpoint is much easier to get into. Part of that is because the game offers multiple starter sets that are all relatively affordable, including the recent Feet First Into Hell set, which is themed after the Halo series' ODST soldiers. The set launched back in October of 2025 and is currently on <strong><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/mantic-Games-Halo-Flashpoint-Board/dp/B0FR946KB1?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20"">sale on Amazon for just $94</a></strong> (was $122.76).</p><div title=""6537618 - Halo: Flashpoint Feet First Into Hell Deal"" data-embed-type=""buylink"" data-ref-id=""5455"" data-template=""4"" data-size=""buylink__listicle"" data-title=""6537618 - Halo: Flashpoint Feet First Into Hell Deal"" data-collection="""" class=""norewrite"">  <div class=""buylink-container"">                                                                     <div class=""js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container"">             <h2 class=""item-title"">                    <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/mantic-Games-Halo-Flashpoint-Board/dp/B0FR946KB1?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Halo: Flashpoint - ODST Feet First Into Hell</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=""item-deck"">                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/mantic-Games-Halo-Flashpoint-Board/dp/B0FR946KB1?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">$94 (was $122.76)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=""image-container"">                                  <img class=""main-image"" src=https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1701/17013431/4639925-odstflashpointmod.jpg>                             <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/mantic-Games-Halo-Flashpoint-Board/dp/B0FR946KB1?tag=gamespot-promos-20""></a>                        </div>              <div class=""item-description""><p>Mantic Games' officially licensed Halo: Flashpoint is an easy to learn and quick-to-set-up strategic multiplayer tabletop game, and the ODST Feet First Into Hell set is packed with everything you need to start playing, including enough minis and gameplay materials for up to two players to field squads of ODST soldiers--two of which are Limited Edition resin sculpt figures.

Some designers stick closely to these prompts, while others take a more experimental approach, creating spaces that push the boundaries of what a <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossings-3-0-update-just-killed-existing-hotel-businesses/1100-6537470/"">hotel</a> room should be.

The Sims 4 Players Are A Bunch Of Deviants Based On How Often This Very NSFW Mod Is Launched,"<p>If you're a dedicated The Sims player, you've likely heard of one of the game's most taboo but oh-so popular mods: <a href=""https://wickedwhimsmod.com/index"">Wicked Whims</a>. First released nearly a decade ago, the adult-oriented mod adds some seriously spicy content to the game--full nudity, <em>a lot</em> of creative WooHoo positions, and the capacity for group ... activities, to name a few. However, it's also worth noting the mod also adds next-level physiological immersion too, as it includes menstrual cycles, fertility tracking, birth control, and STIs in addition to its erotic offerings. As someone who has dabbled with the mod on more than a few occasions, I can attest to it being a wildly impressive mod that completely alters how The Sims 4 plays. And according to its developer, <em>a lot </em>of the game's players are taking advantage of that.</p><p>In a recent interview with German news site <a href=""https://taz.de/Nacktheit-und-Sex-in-Die-Sims/!6142322/"">Taz</a> (which was later reported on by <a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4s-most-notorious-sex-mod-gets-launched-400-000-times-a-day-which-is-more-people-than-i-realized-were-even-playing-the-sims-every-day/"">PC Gamer</a>), Wicked Whims creator Turbodriver shared a staggering statistic regarding how often his mod is launched. According to Turbodriver, Wicked Whims is used around 400,000 times per day. ""That's how often my server is pinged, at least,"" Turbodriver told Taz. He noted that the server is pinged whenever someone starts the game and with the mod installed; with that in mind, that number doesn't directly equate to the amount of players but rather reflects how often Wicked Whims users boot up The Sims 4.</p><p>Regardless, Wicked Whims being booted up 400,000 is an astounding accomplishment, particularly for a mod. To put things into perspective, multiple <a href=""https://tracker.gg/population/title/270041"">data collection sites</a> report that Fortnite sees anywhere from 700,000 to 1.5 millions players daily. Though not a direct comparison, it's still emphasizes just how popular Wicked Whims is.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-4-players-are-a-bunch-of-deviants-based-on-how-often-this-very-nsfw-mod-is-launched/1100-6537605/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-26T00:59:13.463084
Arc Raiders Early 2026 Roadmap Includes Major Updates Every Month,"<p>2025 was a big year for Arc Raiders, but Embark Studios is hoping 2026 will be even bigger. The team has revealed its 2026 roadmap, or at least part of it. Plans for the first four months of the year have officially been revealed, with the team adding new projects (limited-time events), multiple new enemies, and its first new map since last year's claustrophobic Stella Montis joined the world of Arc Raiders. Below we go over everything players can expect to hit the game each month between January and April.</p><h2>Arc Raiders update - January 2026</h2><p>The month is almost over, but a big update is still on the way before the calendar turns to February. The team is adding a new matchmaking option that's reserved for players 40 or higher, a new minor map condition, and a new player project, which has typically meant a limited-time event with free cosmetics. Collectively, this will be called the Headwinds update.</p><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4639845-image%2811%29.png"" data-ref-id=""1300-4639845"" data-ratio=""0.5625"" data-width=""1920"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 1920px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4639845-image%2811%29.png""><img alt=""Arc Raiders 2026 roadmap"" src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4639845-image%2811%29.png"" srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4639845-image%2811%29.png 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4639845-image%2811%29.png 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1632/16320660/4639845-image%2811%29.png 480w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"" data-width=""1280""></a><figcaption>Arc Raiders 2026 roadmap</figcaption></figure><p>One thing the team isn't yet ready to do, for this month and all others listed in this article, is go into specifics.

Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 Director Shares How The Game Is Using AI,"<p>The use of AI tools in game development has been a controversial topic, as more developers have begun using the toolset, including Final Fantasy Remake Part 3 <a href=""https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/its-really-fateful-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-on-charting-a-new-course-for-the-jrpg-series-with-a-return-to-nintendo-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-outdoing-ai/"">publisher Square Enix</a>. Speaking to GameSpot, game director Naoki Hamaguchi said he and his colleagues use AI to handle the more menial aspects of game development, while the creative side remains in human hands.</p><p>""My stance hasn't changed on depending on AI to produce something or to create something,"" Hamaguchi said. "" I don't rely on AI to come up with ideas and things like that. That said, AI is a tool that I and other colleagues would utilize so that our tasks would become much smoother, or some of the menial tasks are taken care of by AI.  I think it's becoming more and more necessary. I think the purpose of utilizing these tools is so that creators will have a better environment so that they can work more efficiently and they can explore more creative options.""</p><p>Checking in-development video games for bugs and other issues can be a thankless--and repetitive task--and this is where AI came in handy, Hamaguchi said. By shifting this inglorious part of the development process to automated AI, it also helped ""reduce the stress"" on the person responsible for that task, Hamaguchi claimed.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-director-shares-how-the-game-is-using-ai/1100-6537604/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-26T00:59:13.463084
Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3's Title Has Finally Been Decided,"<p dir=""ltr"">The ""Remake"" in Final Fantasy VII Remake refers to much more than just the technical aspects of the original 1997 game being remade. The remaking of fate is a core concept of the title that adds additional layers to its story. Remake’s sequel, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, continues that trend by exploring a world reborn by the machinations of the game’s antagonist Sephiroth.</p><p dir=""ltr"">As such, it stands to reason that the final game in the trilogy will use a similar naming convention that ties into the reimagining’s meta narrative. And, according to that game’s director Naoki Hamaguchi, the third and final installment’s title has been decided by the trilogy’s creative director Tetsuya Nomura. ""I remember an <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-title-narrowed-down-to-two-candidates/1100-6536762/"">interview</a> I did at Paris Games Week about how we’d narrowed it down to two [names],"" says Hamaguchi. ""It was up to Mr. Nomura to decide which it is. And yes, after returning from Paris Games Week, he did choose one, so I can say the title has been locked.""</p><p dir=""ltr"">Hamaguchi is in New York City to promote the release of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade on the Nintendo Switch 2, giving us the opportunity to speak with him about the franchise. Regarding the game’s performance on the device--which has been <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUjYGy7cqog&amp;pp=ygUPZGlnaXRhbCBmb3VuZHJ5"">received positively</a> by even the most diehard of pixel peepers--Hamaguchi says that while it was relatively smooth getting the game running on the hardware, the team spent a lot of time trying to achieve a stable frame rate.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-officially-has-a-title/1100-6537603/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-26T00:59:13.463084
"Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 Will ""Enhance"" Queen's Blood, Brings Back Snowboarding","<p>Although Square Enix has already <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-reveal-date-already-decided-says-nomura/1100-6534518/"">decided when to announce Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3</a>, that time hasn't come just yet.

""I want to expand on Queen's Blood so that we are enhancing it, and giving you a more powered-up version of it when you see that third installment … Queen's Blood is still going to be available in the third installment. We just want to expand on it.""</p><p>Hamaguchi declined to share many specific details about the snowboarding sequence, but he did say it won't simply be a minigame as it was in the original Final Fantasy 7. Instead, his team wants ""to make sure that it's incorporated into the story to have that sort of connection with the theming of it.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-enhance-queens-blood-brings-back-snowboarding/1100-6537601/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-26T00:59:13.463084
Marathon: Cross-Play And Cross-Progression Explained,"<p>Extraction shooters are currently taking the world by storm, and Bungie is eager to make its mark on the genre with its fast-paced first-person shooter <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/"">Marathon</a>. Much like <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a>--another popular entry in the world of extraction shooters--Marathon is a much more accessible experience compared to more hardcore titles in the genre, but it still comes packing plenty of danger around every corner.

"Nioh 3 Gameplay Overview Shows You’re A Time-Jumping, Yokai-Killing, Ninja-Samurai Badass","<p>Team Ninja's super-hard souls-like <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/nioh-3/"">Nioh 3</a> lands on February 6 for PC and PlayStation 5, and ahead of its imminent launch, the studio dropped a 17-minute gameplay overview showing off everything you'll do in the action-RPG--from battling historical figures and giant monsters to purifying areas and becoming Shogun.</p><p>The gameplay overview takes you on a whirlwind of excursions, revealing that you're a time-jumping ninja-samurai on a quest to understand why your brother stole the title of Shogun--the military leader and de facto ruler of Japan--and betrayed his countrymen. (Probably for power, as is always the case.) You'll go from the Edo period (approximately 1601 to 1868) back to the Heian period (roughly 794 to 1185) through to the Sengoku (1467 to 1615) and Bakumatsu eras (1853 to 1868) to uncover the truth behind the Crucible's emergence.</p><p>To do all of that, you'll equip yourself with all sorts of weapons--from claws, fists, and odachis to scythes, katanas, and kusarigamas--to slay or get slain as you battle well-trained samurai and freakishly huge monsters on your path toward cleansing the lands of evil. The Crucible, a horrifying realm spawning and enhancing the monstrous creatures overwhelming Japan, is the source, and Nioh 3 will test your patience and resolve to survive long enough to kill everyone and save everything else.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nioh-3-gameplay-overview-shows-youre-a-time-jumping-yokai-killing-ninja-samurai-badass/1100-6537608/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-26T00:59:13.463084

The Fable Reboot Is Doing Away With One Of The Series' Signature Features,"<p>One of the biggest stories to emerge out of this week's <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-developer-direct-2026-all-the-big-announcements/2900-7421/"">Xbox Developer Direct</a> was the long-awaited update about the new <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/fable/"">Fable</a> reboot. It's been 15 years since <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/fable-iii/"">Fable 3</a> wrapped up the original trilogy, but one of the franchise's key features won't be returning in the new game.</p><p>In the first three Fable games, the physical appearance of player characters changed depending on their moral alignment. This was called ""morphing,"" and players who were particularly bad took on a devilish appearance complete with horns. According to Fable general manager and director Ralph Fulton, that won't be the case in the new game.</p><p>""That sort of character morphing feature--obviously a really central part of the original games--it's not in ours,"" Fulton told <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground"">IGN</a>. ""There is no objective good and evil. And the original games were predicated on there being an objective good and an objective evil, and you were somewhere along that scale, and that's what determined how your appearance changed. But for us, that doesn't really work. The way I've described our morality system working, you're never that thing, absolutely. You're different things to different people based on what they like or what they choose to value. So, that's one reason that it didn't work.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-fable-reboot-is-doing-away-with-one-of-the-series-signature-features/1100-6537596/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-26T00:59:13.463084

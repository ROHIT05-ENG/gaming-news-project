So, having completely overlooked Bandai Namco's anime-hued Soulslike Code Vein when it released back in 2019, its sequel was well off my radar. Until, that is, dark forces (Eurogamer editor-in-chief Tom Orry) conspired to nudge it into my orbit.

While this season spent a lot of time following our heroes through Mojave Wasteland, last week set up the final stakes. The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) made his way into the Lucky 38 and reactivated Mr. House (Justin Theroux), Maximus (Aaron Moten) found his fight against the vicious Deathclaws bleed into Freeside, and Lucy (Ella Purnell) faced a moral dilemma as she came face-to-face with the mainframe of the Automated Man devices, which are now fully functioning thanks to her father Hank (Kyle Maclaclan). With all these storylines finally reaching their apexes, it's time to dive into what choices our heroes made.</p><p>The episode opens up with a bloody civil conflict amongst Caesar’s Legion. In the chaos, Lacerta Legate (Macaulay Culkin) manages to get his hands on Caesar’s corpse and drag it to his tent where he learns that his final will was for the Legion to die with him. Refusing this fate for the Legion, Lacerta kills the nearby soldiers and destroys the will, taking the golden laurels for himself. Officially crowning himself as the new Caesar, he unites the Legion and vows to march into New Vegas to establish a new “Palace.” This is met with thunderous applause.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-episode-8-just-set-up-the-biggest-faction-war-the-fallout-universe-has-ever-seen/1100-6537878/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-04T12:32:50.496107
Fallout Season 2's Finale Might Have Hinted At Where The Next Game Takes Place,"<p>All points came to a head this week in New Vegas for the Fallout season two finale. While this season spent a lot of time giving us a glimpse into how the Mojave Wasteland had changed since we last saw it in Fallout: New Vegas, the finale delivered on being an immensely satisfying ending while also setting up bombshells that we can’t wait to see play out in season three. With lots of build up comes lots of opportunity to slip in easter eggs and references from the video games and beyond, so let’s take a look at what was shown this week.</p><p><strong>Caesar’s Palace</strong></p><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1860/18602785/4645124-cpalace.jpg"" data-ref-id=""1300-4645124"" data-ratio=""0.561875"" data-width=""1600"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 1600px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1860/18602785/4645124-cpalace.jpg""><img alt=""No Caption Provided"" src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1860/18602785/4645124-cpalace.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1860/18602785/4645124-cpalace.jpg 1600w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1860/18602785/4645124-cpalace.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1860/18602785/4645124-cpalace.jpg 480w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"" data-width=""1280""></a></figure><p>The finale showed Legate Lacerta (Macaulay Culkin) take over the Legion as the new Caesar.

This is a winking nod to the real life Caesar’s Palace resort and casino located on the Las Vegas strip.

"GTA 6 Will Be Available On As A Physical Release On Day One, Take-Two Confirms","<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/"">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> is coming this year after a long wait, and as it gets closer, rumors have begun to pop up about its launch. One rumor that has gained considerable traction is that the game would launch as a <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-not-having-a-physical-disc-at-launch-wouldnt-be-a-huge-deal-analyst-says/1100-6537681/"">digital-only title</a>, with a physical release coming at some point after release. The logic behind the rumor was that a physical release of the game could lead to early leaks ahead of the game's launch, and that publisher Take-Two might be willing to go to great lengths to avoid this.</p><p>As it turns out, though, this is not the plan. Talking to <a href=""https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/"">Variety</a> following an earnings call, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick has confirmed that the publisher does not intend to delay the game's physical release. When asked directly about the rumor that the game will not be available physically on launch day to avoid potential leaks, Zelnick gave a straightforward response: ""That's not the plan"".</p><p>Based on this, it seems that you'll be able to buy the game on disc on launch day if that's your preference, which is good news for physical games stores around the world. Zelnick also said that the game's release date, November 19, 2026, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-november-release/1100-6537831/"">is still locked in</a>, although rumors will likely continue to circulate right through to release date--there's speculation that the game will carry a <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-warrants-a-100-price-tag-gta-5-actor-says/1100-6535876/"">larger-than-normal price tag</a>, for instance.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-will-be-available-on-as-a-physical-release-on-day-one-take-two-confirms/1100-6537898/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-04T12:32:50.496107
"Borderlands 4 On Switch 2 Has Paused Development, And Might Never Release","<p>In a recently-released <a href=""https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/2026-roadmap/"">roadmap for the future of Borderlands 4</a>, one milestone was <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-2026-roadmap-doesnt-include-switch-2-release/1100-6537785/"">suspiciously absent</a>--the game's Switch 2 port, which was previously <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-has-been-delayed/1100-6534965/"">delayed indefinitely</a> just 10 days before its original launch date. Now, publisher Take-Two Interactive has revealed why that's the case, and it's not good news for anyone holding out for the game on Nintendo's hybrid console.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=""https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/"">Variety</a>, spokesperson Alan Lewis has revealed that development on the Switch 2 version is paused. ""We made the difficult decision to pause development on that SKU,"" he told the outlet, while affirming that the company is still committing to the system with upcoming games like PGA Tour 2K25 and WWE 2K26.</p><p>The use of the word ""pause"" indicates that development on the Switch 2 port of Borderlands 4 could, theoretically, resume in the future, as it's not technically cancelled, but there's no guarantee that this will happen.

Take A Look At These Two Chappell Roan Fortnite Skins Coming This Week,"<p>After a few weeks of rumors, Epic Games finally revealed that Chappell Roan will be the next <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/"">Fortnite</a> Festival headlining artist when the new music pass launches on Thursday, February 5. As is usually the case with these things, Roan will have a skin, the Pink Pony Club jam track, and other cosmetics on the new Heartcore music pass, along with an additional set of items and jam tracks available for direct purchase in the item shop.</p><p>Buying the music pass--which is included with Fortnite Crew, or can be purchased on its own for 1400 V-Bucks--will instantly unlock the Chappell Roan skin. Players can then unlock the rest of the items on the pass, including several musical instruments and an additional style for the Chappell Roan skin, by gaining XP in any Fortnite mode. There should be a number of jam tracks other than Pink Pony Club included on the pass, but we don't know what they are yet. And there will also be some free items on the pass that you can earn without buying it.</p><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4645560-fortnitechappell.jpg"" data-ref-id=""1300-4645560"" data-ratio=""0.5625"" data-width=""1920"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 1920px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4645560-fortnitechappell.jpg""><img alt=""No Caption Provided"" src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4645560-fortnitechappell.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4645560-fortnitechappell.jpg 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4645560-fortnitechappell.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1757/17577455/4645560-fortnitechappell.jpg 480w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"" data-width=""1280""></a></figure><figure data-embed-type=""gallery"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4645563-chappellroanfestivalpass.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4645562-chappellroanfestivalpass1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4645561-fortnitechappellroanshop.jpg"" data-ref-id=""1300-4645563,1300-4645562,1300-4645561"" data-resize-urls=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4645563-chappellroanfestivalpass.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4645562-chappellroanfestivalpass1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4645561-fortnitechappellroanshop.jpg""><div class=""image-gallery__label"">Gallery</div>   <div class=""image-gallery__list hide-scrollbar image-gallery__list--small"">       <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4645563-chappellroanfestivalpass.jpg"">       <img src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4645563-chappellroanfestivalpass.jpg"" alt=""Gallery image 1"" data-full-srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4645563-chappellroanfestivalpass.jpg 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4645563-chappellroanfestivalpass.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1757/17577455/4645563-chappellroanfestivalpass.jpg 480w"" />     </a>       <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4645562-chappellroanfestivalpass1.jpg"">       <img src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4645562-chappellroanfestivalpass1.jpg"" alt=""Gallery image 2"" data-full-srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4645562-chappellroanfestivalpass1.jpg 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4645562-chappellroanfestivalpass1.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1757/17577455/4645562-chappellroanfestivalpass1.jpg 480w"" />     </a>       <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4645561-fortnitechappellroanshop.jpg"">       <img src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4645561-fortnitechappellroanshop.jpg"" alt=""Gallery image 3"" data-full-srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4645561-fortnitechappellroanshop.jpg 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4645561-fortnitechappellroanshop.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1757/17577455/4645561-fortnitechappellroanshop.jpg 480w"" />     </a>   </div>  </figure><p>Over in the shop, we'll have the Roan of Arc skin, with the singer sporting her iconic armored look from the 2024 VMAs.

Jill Valentine may not be in Requiem, but the original RE heroine is finally getting Jill's Sandwich, which is a play on the infamous line in the first game.</p><p>For the record, a Jill's Sandwich is comprised of double all-beef patties, applewood smoked bacon, melty cheese, pickles, a special burger sauce, and a butter-toasted bun. You can wash that down with <a href=""https://drafthouse.com/austin/news/raccoon-city-cinema-limited-time-menu"">a T-Virus Cocktail or a Blue Umbrella Serum</a>, although the Drafthouse employees will probably give you a soda if you ask for it.</p><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4645489-residentevilalamojillsandwich.jpg"" data-ref-id=""1300-4645489"" data-ratio=""0.56230769230769"" data-width=""1300"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 1300px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4645489-residentevilalamojillsandwich.jpg""><img alt=""Jill's Sandwich"" src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4645489-residentevilalamojillsandwich.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4645489-residentevilalamojillsandwich.jpg 1300w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4645489-residentevilalamojillsandwich.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1837/18375603/4645489-residentevilalamojillsandwich.jpg 480w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"" data-width=""1280""></a><figcaption>Jill's Sandwich</figcaption></figure><p>The other items on this menu are the Red + Green Herb Hot Dog Combo--which doesn't feature any healing effects from the herbs--and Bingo!

Did Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 Hint That The Worst Fallout: New Vegas Ending Could Be Canon?,"<p>With The Ghoul reactivating Mr. House, Lucy discovering the mainframe of her father’s devices, and Maximus having to protect Freeside, the penultimate episode of Fallout season two raised the stakes for an all-out finale in New Vegas. Yet for as much time as this episode dedicated to building up relationships and faction statuses, episode seven still delivered the goods when it came to action and references to the original games. With that being said, let’s dive right in to this week’s easter eggs:</p><h3><strong>New (California) Threads</strong></h3><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1860/18602785/4645322-ncrmaximu.jpg"" data-ref-id=""1300-4645322"" data-ratio=""0.6974358974359"" data-width=""3900"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 3900px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1860/18602785/4645322-ncrmaximu.jpg""><img alt=""No Caption Provided"" src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1860/18602785/4645322-ncrmaximu.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1860/18602785/4645322-ncrmaximu.jpg 3900w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1860/18602785/4645322-ncrmaximu.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1860/18602785/4645322-ncrmaximu.jpg 480w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"" data-width=""1280""></a></figure><p>When The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) and Maximus realize they need to stock up to battle the Deathclaws that are overrunning the strip, they head to a secret New California Republic armory. While at first nothing seems to stand out amongst the arsenal of weapons, a single piece stands out: an NCR themed suit of power armor. While we’re not quite sure why this even exists, there’s no denying the power of good brand recognition.</p><h3><strong>Not A Ghoul But Something Much Worse</strong></h3><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1860/18602785/4645323-centaur.jpg"" data-ref-id=""1300-4645323"" data-ratio=""0.5625"" data-width=""1280"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 1280px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1860/18602785/4645323-centaur.jpg""><img alt=""No Caption Provided"" src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1860/18602785/4645323-centaur.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1860/18602785/4645323-centaur.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1860/18602785/4645323-centaur.jpg 480w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"" data-width=""1280""></a></figure><p>Throughout the episode, Thaddeus’ (Johnny Pemberton) condition worsens. Curious as to when his nose will fall off, he shows The Ghoul an alarming new mutation he’s developed: a gaping mouth growing in the center of his chest (in addition to his arm falling off). Now while it’s not quite confirmed what exactly he turning into, it’s definitely not a ghoul. For my money, he’s showing signs of turning into a Centaur. One of the most horrifying creatures in the Fallout universe.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/did-fallout-season-2-episode-7-hint-that-the-worst-fallout-new-vegas-ending-could-be-canon/1100-6537885/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-04T12:32:50.496107

Sony Files Patent For Generative-AI Podcast Starring Game Characters,"<p>Putting AI elements in games has already become a bigger part of the industry, and now Sony wants AI to talk about games as well. Sony has filed a patent for a generative AI podcast that would be starring its video game characters.</p><p>The <a href=""https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US471594142&amp;_cid=P22-MKTGE2-37885-1"">complete patent listing</a> for Sony's LLM-based generative podcast for gamers puts forth some ambitious ideas even though it doesn't settle every issue that may arise from them. According to the listing, Sony sees these podcasts as a way to reach individual gamers with news tailored to their tastes that comes in the form of an audio or video podcast hosted by the main character or characters of a game recently played on the console.</p><p>Deepfake voices will sidestep the need for actors, as the LLM creates banter and a news-like program that delivers tips, gaming news, and more games of interest to the player in question. The patent doesn't state if the generative podcast would be limited to Sony's proprietary characters or if it would extend to characters from third-party games.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-files-patent-for-generative-ai-podcast-starring-game-characters/1100-6537882/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-04T12:32:50.496107
"Switch 2 Price Could Go Up By $50 Or $100, Expert Predicts","<p>The Switch 2 could get a price hike in 2026, but how much more should people prepare to pay? <a href=""https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/2018732733451612335"">According to Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad</a>, Nintendo may opt to raise the price of the Switch 2 by $50 or $100.

Nintendo's $35 Talking Flower Will Briefly Tell You The Wrong Time,"<p>Nintendo recently held a hands-on showcase event with a bevy of demos for upcoming games. And while less of a focus than the games themselves, the presentation also included an opportunity for a closer look at some of its upcoming products like the new <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2-edition-features-playable-rosalina-17-new-minigames/1100-6537570/"">Mario Wonder Amiibo figures</a> and <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-selling-a-talking-flower/1100-6537571/"">$35 Talking Flower</a>. We had a chance to get hands on with the Alarmo-adjacent doodad and it is certainly a talking flower.</p><p>A brief video walked us through the functionality. It will say random phrases from time to time, and you can press a button on the front to prompt it to speak. You can set a wake-up time or bedtime so the flower will wish you well, and that way it'll stay quiet at night. The phrases shift based on the time of day, and it's attuned to the room temperature so it can tell you if it's a little chillier today, and it will alert you if it needs a battery change. In music mode it can activate a ""Wonder Mode,"" playing the Mario Wonder music.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR4W3e-_3zs"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uR4W3e-_3zs"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>The oddest feature, so to speak, is the ability to tell the time, but Talking Flower will sometimes tell you the <em>wrong</em> time.

"Apex Legends Adds Breachable Windows In Season 28, And Gives Fuse A Rocket Jump","<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/"">Apex Legends</a> Season 28 is also the start of the battle royale's Year 7, and the Respawn team is keeping to tradition by implementing a substantial gameplay change for the game's birthday. Season 28, titled Breach, introduces breakable windows and skylights to Apex Legends called Hardlight Meshes. These surfaces can be breached by squads trying to find additional ways into a building, or reinforced by players bunkering inside who are trying to hold a point-of-interest. These new mechanics sound like some you might find in <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/"">Rainbow Six Siege</a> (or <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/highguard-is-a-fresh-enough-combo-that-it-could-be-the-start-of-a-whole-new-thing/1100-6537648/"">Highguard</a>, the recently released raid shooter from former Apex Legends developers).</p><p dir=""ltr"">This isn't a small change, either. Hardlight Meshes will be added to all of the maps rotating into the battle royale playlists this season (World's Edge, Broken Moon, and E-District). Save for Olympus, these three maps have the most urban environments of all of Apex Legends' maps. That means there are plenty of buildings that have been remade by the sole conceit that they now have multiple breach points, making them significantly harder to defend.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRNJoZD_nvQ"" data-width=""854"" data-height=""480"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XRNJoZD_nvQ"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir=""ltr"">""As with all new additions to Apex, community feedback will certainly drive the conversation and inform our future updates and tuning,"" senior game designer Connor Monahan told me. ""Playtesting internally, the places where we feel Hardlight [has] the most [impact] fall into two big categories. The first category is buildings previously very difficult to assault that now have narrow weaknesses you can exploit to break in. Examples that come to mind are some Lunar buildings--the tube-shaped structures--on [Broken] Moon, four-story buildings and Powerbank on E-District, and Lava Siphon on World's Edge.

New Third-Person World War 2 Game Brings Nazi Hunting Up Close And Personal,"<p>For the last two decades, the vast majority of World War 2 games have been first-person shooters. ProbablyMonsters' upcoming title, Nekome: Nazi Hunter, is going to buck that trend with its single-player third-person experience. In the first teaser for the game, the main character demonstrates his abilities by fatally stabbing a Nazi soldier.</p><p>The lead character's name is Vano Nastasu, and he's not a soldier. He's a Romani who was persecuted by the Nazis and was subsequently unable to prevent his family from being murdered. However, Nastasu survived and now the hunted has become a hunter himself. His story of revenge will play out behind enemy lines across Europe during the war.</p><p>According to ProbablyMonsters, this game was inspired by grindhouse cinema. Players will be able stalk their prey, scout out enemy routes, and make their assassinations personal and precise. Nastasu has been given ""grounded finishing moves,"" which will come ""together in a symphony of violence where every encounter carries lasting consequences.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-third-person-world-war-2-game-brings-nazi-hunting-up-close-and-personal/1100-6537857/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-04T12:32:50.496107

How Mario Tennis Fever Sets Itself Apart From Other Recent Mario Sports Games,"<p dir=""ltr"">Mario's sports spin-offs during the Switch era have been mostly decent, but also, largely unsurprising. There have been few frills and largely anemic single-player modes, and the occasional experiment like Mario Golf Super Rush have been divisive. Mario Tennis Fever is the first in the sport spin-off genre on Switch 2, and a chance to set a new course for the company. After a hands-on with it at a recent Nintendo event, I can't say whether it has course-corrected on the single-player, but the multiplayer is so chockablock with options and game-changing effects that I'm intrigued.</p><p dir=""ltr"">In fact, the main hook of the new game--the titular Fever rackets--have such wild impacts on the court that at times Fever felt more like a party game than a sports title. Our couch competitive experience was frequently interrupted by raucous trash talk and surprised screams as new effects totally changed the match mid-volley.</p><p dir=""ltr"">But first, the basics. A short tutorial explained the mechanics of Mario Tennis Fever, which are largely unchanged from previous tennis titles. You serve and volley just as you'd expect, and you hit the button early or double-tap for charged and powered-up effects, respectively. Mario and the gang look especially great here, thanks to the enhanced power of the Switch 2 and relatively limited scope of what's on screen.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-mario-tennis-fever-sets-itself-apart-from-other-recent-mario-sports-games/1100-6537844/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-04T12:32:50.496107
Super Mario Wonder Turns Into Mario Party With The Bellabel Park Expansion,"<p dir=""ltr"">So far, Nintendo's Switch 2 upgrade packs have been all over the map. There are the smaller ones with just a few quality-of-life features like Animal Crossing, serious upgrades like the Legend of Zelda games, and larger-scale expansions like Kirby's Star-Crossed World expansion. Super Mario Bros. Wonder's Switch 2 upgrade, Meetup at Bellabel Park, is priced like a larger expansion, but that doesn't quite capture the nature of what it is. Instead, based on a hands-on experience with Nintendo, it transforms the game into something else entirely, borrowing liberally from the Mario Party series.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Though Mario Wonder allowed you to go through its stages in multiplayer, Bellabel Park is centered around bespoke multiplayer minigames, using the Mario Wonder platforming as its mechanical underpinnings. So unlike an actual Mario Party game, in which the randomized minigames might challenge you to do new and unfamiliar things at a regular clip, these feel more like platforming challenges with a little bit of party game spirit.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Since they're built around traditional Mario platforming, the challenges aren't entirely competitive. We first played a cooperative level that had one player using the Switch 2 mouse functionality to draw Donut Blocks, Mario Maker style, to guide the other three players through a stage that was one big pit hazard. That by itself would be not much more than a neat toy-like experiment, but the stage was also littered with occasional hazards and puzzle challenges, like a special coin nested inside a set of breakable boxes. The Donut Block player would need to draw a path for a spike ball to roll its way into the boxes so that the other players could access the coin; and naturally, we were all shouting out tips of where and how to draw the path, adding to the chaotic fun of the whole experience.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-wonder-turns-into-mario-party-with-the-bellabel-park-expansion/1100-6537843/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-04T12:32:50.496107

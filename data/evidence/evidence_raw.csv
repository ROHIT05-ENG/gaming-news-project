This unique setup leads to some inventive action sequences. Tessa, meanwhile, is the primary antagonist in Badlands. Fanning does a great job portraying both characters, and Koloamatangi's performance as the new Predator is superb.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/predator-badlands-4k-blu-ray-limited-edition-steelbook-predator-alien-movie-collections/1100-6537281/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-09T00:54:24.421187
Rockstar's Battle With Union Over Fired Devs Goes To Court,"<p>Near the end of October 2025, Rockstar fired over thirty devs in the United Kingdom and Canada over what it called ""gross misconduct."" The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/"">accused Rockstar of union busting</a> for laying off workers who were organizing with the union. Both sides have held firm since the initial accusations, and now the battle has gone to court in the UK.</p><p>As reported by <a href=""https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fired-rockstar-games-developers-fight-for-payroll-relief-at-employment-tribunal-hearing/"">Video Games Chronicle</a>, Rockstar and the IWGB went before the court earlier this week, where the latter requested that the fired workers be given ""interim relief"" while the legal drama plays out. If granted, that would place the affected workers back on Rockstar's payroll and allow some to keep their visas that were reliant on their jobs. The court will reportedly decide on the matter before the end of the week.</p><p>The IWGB pledged to continue fighting for the workers regardless of the court's decision, while Rockstar reiterated its position that the workers broke the company's policy.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstars-battle-with-union-over-fired-devs-goes-to-court/1100-6537286/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-09T00:54:24.421187
New Switch 2 Joy-Cons Are Here And They're Extremely Underwhelming,"<p>Nintendo has revealed its first set of <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-joy-con-2-light-purple-light-green-preorder-roundup/1100-6537276/"">new Joy-Con controllers</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2 and I'll be honest, I'm a bit disappointed.</p><p>To be clear, I'm not disappointed (or surprised) by the $100 price tag, as the original Switch Joy-Cons are still $90, the standard Switch 2 Joy-Cons are $100, and all gaming hardware is <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/"">pretty expensive</a> right now. No, it's not the cost that bothers me, but rather how little these new Joy-Cons differentiate themselves from the pair that already exist.</p><p>Similar to the original Switch's Joy-Cons, it appears that the various colorways for the Switch 2 versions will feature two different colors; in the case of these newly announced Joy-Cons, those colors are a bright, pastel purple and a vibrant aqua that the company refers to as ""Light Green."" Despite not fully agreeing with Nintendo on what constitutes light green, I actually really like these new colors. It took a long time for me to care for any of the original Switch's Joy-Con colorways enough to purchase them, as the vast majority are extremely saturated and don't feature color combinations that I feel pair well together. I was so starved for options, in fact, that I purchased the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch largely because I thought it featured the best Joy-Con colors available. In that sense, these new Joy-Cons definitely feel like an improvement.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-switch-2-joy-cons-are-here-and-theyre-extremely-underwhelming/1100-6537284/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-09T00:54:24.421187
"New GTA 6 Delay Rumor Shot Down By Reporter, Says Statement Was Misconstrued","<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/"">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is still a little over 10 months away, assuming its November 2026 release window holds. Earlier this week, GTA 6 watchers were unsettled when Bloomberg's Jason Schreier noted that the game might not be as ""content complete"" as Rockstar has said in the past, and he didn't rule out another delay. Some fans took that as if GTA 6 was already pushed back again, which is why Schreier has stepped forward to clarify his comments.</p><p>During a recent appearance on the <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/episode/1EANk4uOn68ddip6pKliqY"">Button Mash</a> podcast, Schreier said, ""The last I heard, [GTA 6] was still not content complete. That is to say people were still finishing things up, still finalizing levels, and missions, and seeing what is going to make it into the game."" He added that he doesn't ""think anyone at Rockstar can tell you, with 100% certainty, that they will make it out in November.""</p><p>Schreier responded to reports based on his comments by reiterating that he ""wouldn't be shocked if GTA 6 'does' come out this fall, following the same delay pattern as [Red Dead Redemption 2]."" He also characterized some of the reports as, ""a complete misunderstanding of what I said.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-gta-6-delay-rumor-shot-down-by-reporter-says-statement-was-misconstrued/1100-6537283/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-09T00:54:24.421187

Why Some Believe A Witcher 3 Expansion Is Coming Soon,"<p>Near the end of 2024, CD Projekt Red put <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-4/"">The Witcher 4</a> into full development with a release date potentially years away. Now, some outlets are putting forth theories that there may be a new <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/"">Witcher 3</a> expansion to fill the gap between the present and the fourth game's release.</p><p><a href=""https://pl.ign.com/wiedzmin-3/69405/news/wiedzmin-3-nowe-dlc-zabierze-nas-na-pustynie-ujawniamy-nasze-informacje-sprzed-lat-i-rzucamy-nowe-sw?_gl=1*15mojc3*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTI2MzU0NjY5LjE3Njc4OTI3MzQ.*_ga_736S6FVMCL*czE3Njc4OTI3MzQkbzEkZzAkdDE3Njc4OTI3MzQkajYwJGwwJGgw"">IGN Poland</a> and <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year"">Eurogamer</a> separately released stories suggesting that The Witcher 3 will get its first expansion since Blood and Wine was released in 2016. Eurogamer's report suggests that the drive to release something new this year is because CD Projekt Red is behind sales goals that would trigger financial incentives for its employees.</p><p>That program has been <a href=""https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf"">mentioned by the company itself</a>, which stated in a 2025 investor's call that, ""There is a chance that new content hinted upon in recent calls and reports may see release in the coming year, having an impact on our results and increasing the likelihood of achieving the earnings condition for the first stage of the incentive program.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-some-believe-a-witcher-3-expansion-is-coming-soon/1100-6537282/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-09T00:54:24.421187

Arc Raiders A Warm Place To Rest Quest Guide,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a> sends you on a handful of quests seeking out evidence of survivors, including A Warm Place to Rest. In this quest, you'll have to find any signs that raiders have survived topside near the Abandoned Highway Camp in Buried City. We'll tell you everything you need to know about this quest and how to complete it in this guide.</p><p>You don't need to extract to complete A Warm Place to Rest, but you will be trekking across the entire Buried City map to complete the objectives. With this in mind, a free loadout may not be your best bet, as you're rather likely to encounter raiders or ARC, which means you'll probably need extra healing items. It's your choice, of course, but we'd recommend bringing a decent gun or two, and enough heals to keep you trucking along safely.</p><p>When you're ready to finish A Warm Place to Rest, follow the steps below.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-a-warm-place-to-rest-quest-guide/1100-6537266/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-09T00:54:24.421187
Arc Raiders Communication Hideout Quest Guide,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a>' Buried City map is home to a lot of the game's most interesting quests, including Communication Hideout, which sends you to the Red Tower to complete various steps so that you can boot up an antenna. If you're setting out to check this one off your list, we've got every step listed out for you.</p><p>You won't need to extract to finish this quest, so come in with a free loadout if you'd rather play it safe. Losing valuable items while questing is never fun, after all. That being said, there's some potentially good loot near the quest's Red Tower POI, such as the Santa Maria houses, so there's more to do in the area if you want to come better prepared.</p><p>Either way, when you're ready to complete Communication Hideout, follow the steps below.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-communication-hideout-quest-guide/1100-6537265/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-09T00:54:24.421187
Arc Raiders Lost In Transmission Quest Guide,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a> occasionally sends you on quests that require you to enter areas that require a key. One of these quests, Lost in Transmission, asks you to head up into Spaceport's Control Tower A6, where you'll need to establish a connection from a terminal there. We're here to guide you through each step of this short but potentially dangerous quest.</p><p>There are two important things to note about this quest:</p><ul><li><strong>You must bring the Spaceport Control Tower Key into the raid</strong>. You will be granted this key upon accepting the quest, and you will not be able to open the necessary door and reach the terminal without it. Place the key in a safe pocket to ensure it's not lost during any potential firefights you encounter. If you didn't bring it or have already lost it, there's a chance someone else will have opened the door, but otherwise you'll need to acquire a new key, which can be found randomly as loot on any map.</li><li>Speaking of firefights, the locked room of Control Tower A6 tends to contain really good loot, so <strong>other raiders will often contest this location</strong>. If you're lucky, your visit to Control Tower A6 may end up quiet. But there's always a chance that you'll need to take someone out, so come prepared.</li></ul><p>When you're ready to tackle Lost in Transmission, follow the steps below.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-lost-in-transmission-quest-guide/1100-6537264/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-09T00:54:24.421187
GameStop CEO Could Ring In Big Payday But With An Even Bigger Caveat,"<p>GameStop announced this week that a proposed pay package worth approximately $35 billion for its CEO, Ryan Cohen, was in the works. The compensation is tied entirely to the company's performance and depends on a major turnaround. To earn it, Cohen must increase GameStop's market value by more than 10 times and significantly raise profits.</p><p>Meeting these goals would require a big change for GameStop, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-stock-slumps-as-games-and-hardware-sales-decline/1100-6536830/"">which has struggled in recent years</a>.

Arc Raiders A Balanced Harvest Quest Guide,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a> quests love sending players to the Research &amp; Administration building on Dam Battlegrounds. One such quest, A Balanced Harvest, tasks you with visiting this hectic location and finding some files on a research project. Getting in and out can be tricky, so we've prepared a guide on how to finish your objectives as quickly as possible.</p><p>You can feel free to bring a free kit into Dam Battlegrounds for this quest, as you won't be required to extract. If you die in the very busy Research &amp; Administration building--which you'll have to visit to complete your objectives--you certainly don't want to lose any good gear. That being said, if you're prone to enjoying PvP, you can always come more prepared for this PvP-centric POI. It's entirely your call, of course.</p><p>When you're ready to wrap up the A Balanced Harvest quest, read on for how to complete each step.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-a-balanced-harvest-quest-guide/1100-6537260/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-09T00:54:24.421187
Baby Waluigi Cries Waaaah In Mario Tennis Fever,"<p dir=""ltr"">Nintendo has released a new overview trailer for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6534693/"">Mario Tennis Fever, the upcoming sports game for Switch 2</a>. While the video goes over various modes and special rackets, the most important revelation is Baby Waluigi. He's a real playable character, and he's spectacular.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Baby Waluigi, who we caught a brief glimpse of during the announcement trailer last year, isn't the only newcomer to Mario Tennis Fever, though. The game will feature Goomba, Nabbit, Piranha Plant, and Baby Wario for the first time as part of the playable cast, consisting of 38 characters overall. The sports title will also serve up 30 Fever Rackets. Nintendo showcased some of the special abilities tied to these frames, such as the Pokey Racket and Golden Dash Racket. The former spawns enemies on your opponent's court, while the latter can make your character super agile.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Nintendo also detailed how to counter Fever shots. If players can volley the ball back--meaning not allowing it to bounce off the court--the special effect can be sent back. For instance, the Ice Racket creates a frozen surface on the court. Instead of this slippery area appearing on your side, you can volley the Fever shot back to your opponent.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baby-waluigi-cries-waaaah-in-mario-tennis-fever/1100-6537275/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-09T00:54:24.421187
Nintendo Switch 2 Sales Were Reportedly Not Amazing Over The Holidays,"<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 was indisputably a sales hit after its June 2025 launch, but a new report indicates that the hybrid console's success may not match up to the original Switch's first holiday season.</p><p>According to <a href=""https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/nintendo-switch-2-sales-stumble-over"">The Game Business</a>, Switch 2 sales in the United States were down by around 35% from November to December compared to Switch 1 sales during the same period in its launch year of 2017.

The series has inspired a line of PC gaming hardware from Asus, vibrant Nvidia graphics cards decked out in Evangelion symbols and text, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/these-neon-genesis-evangelion-gaming-lights-will-make-your-room-look-like-an-eva-unit-cockpit/1100-6525404/"">Govee's popular line of Evangelion gaming lights</a>, and the recently released <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/neon-genesis-evangelion-casio-watch/1100-6535582/"">Casio Evangelion watch,</a> an eye-catching celebration of the anime's 30th anniversary.</p><p>If it's anything like Razer's Pokemon collection that launched last year, you can probably expect to see gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets get an Evangelion makeover.

How The Elder Scrolls Online Is Going All-In On Seasons In 2026,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online/"">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> in 2026 will look quite different from previous years, as developer ZeniMax Online Studios goes all-in on the game's new seasonal model that will see all of the game's content updates arrive free of charge.</p><p dir=""ltr"">For years, ESO has followed a familiar, fairly typical MMO pattern of yearly paid chapter (expansion) releases. Those new chapters added new regions of Tamriel for players to explore, additional story content, optional paid DLCs, and, occasionally, things like new classes and systems.</p><p dir=""ltr"">ZeniMax Online announced in 2024 that going forward, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-online-is-ditching-chapters-in-favor-of-more-frequent-bite-sized-updates/1100-6528526/"">ESO wouldn't have a traditional yearly chapter release</a>, labeling 2025 as a ""transitional"" year as the team prepared to focus on its plans for 2026. In a recent livestream and subsequent press Q&amp;A attended by GameSpot, the developers have now revealed what ESO's 2026 will look like, and it includes more experimental seasonal content, battle passes, new story content, solo dungeons, a PvP progression system, class reworks, and more.The team also announced its long-term goals for the game, including that it's looking to finally introduce cross-play between platforms, as well as long-requested features such as guild mail and guild housing.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-the-elder-scrolls-online-is-going-all-in-on-seasons-in-2026/1100-6537219/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-09T00:54:24.421187

Closer to the end of the year, the Greymoor chapter will also become part of the base game.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Currently, ESO players need to subscribe to the game's optional ESO Plus membership (around $15 a month) or purchase each DLC separately using the game's premium currency, Crowns, in order to access the content outlined above.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-onlines-dark-brotherhood-and-thieves-guild-dlc-will-soon-be-free/1100-6537209/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-09T00:54:24.421187

Over 100 popular 4K Blu-rays are available for $11 each when you buy at least three movies. This is Amazon's first 3 for $33 movie sale since last April, so physical media enthusiasts should take advantage of this awesome offer while they can. The catalog of eligible 4K Blu-rays features some of the most popular movies of 2025, including <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FK8ZGMVQ?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Weapons</a>, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FP47283L?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20"">F1 The Movie</a>, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FDFS8CG6?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Superman</a>, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3QYVK1N?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Sinners</a>, and <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCYYBT6X?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Jurassic World Rebirth</a>. </p><p>Though framed as ""3 for $33,"" the promotion turns into 4 for $44, 5 for $55, etc. as you add more movies to your cart. After hitting the minimum, all additional 4K Blu-rays are priced at $11, too.</p><p>Amazon's 3 for $33 movie sale runs through January 19. The retailer often adds movies to these types of promotions while it's running, so it's worth checking back to see if there's anything new you want. Amazon also tends to remove movies from its 4K Blu-ray sales, so if you see a movie you want, grab it while you can. Newer movies and all-time classics frequently sell out during 3 for $33 promotions.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-4k-blu-ray-sale-january-2026-3-for-33-new-movie-deal/1100-6537208/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-09T00:54:24.421187

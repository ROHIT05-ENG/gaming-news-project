Plenty of good work was done since on the game but most people outside of Overwatch 2 don't care - or don't know, because they're not looking anymore. They've moved on, they're playing other things. Incremental updates weren't enough to turn their heads. As far as many people were concerned, Overwatch 2 was yesterday's news, been and gone.

Your character, Takechiyo, is good: noble, just, <em>proper</em>. Your brother, a bitter little rat tempted by ancient powers beyond his understanding (of course), is evil. His desire for power and notoriety is so distinct, in fact, that it has somehow summoned a supernatural 'crucible' from the darkest reaches of space-time, and this consuming chaos is so profound, it has managed to seep into four major eras of Japanese history.

"Next Xbox Console Will Feature Epic Games Store ""On Day One""","<p>The launch window for the next generation of consoles is still unknown, but when it happens, Epic Games plans to have its store on one of the major systems on ""day one."" According to Epic's Steve Allison, Microsoft has already conveyed that the Epic Games Store is welcome on the new Xbox console.</p><p>""We definitely plan to be on the new hardware for Xbox,"" Allison told <a href=""https://www.gamefile.news/p/epic-has-many-plans-for-its-game"">Game File</a>. ""Because, unless their policy or stance on it changes, they are telling us they're going to welcome that. And we're going be there, like, on day one. That will probably require us to build in whatever their requirements are, some sort of software to support that.""</p><p>If that goes forward, it could change the fundamental way that console players purchase digital games. PC gamers are able to use any digital marketplace, but Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have their own proprietary gaming outlets. It's been a closed ecosystem through the current console generation. Adding Epic Games Store to the next Xbox would essentially be inviting players to spend money at a rival to the Xbox store that would have otherwise gone to Microsoft. It could also lead to pricing wars, if games available on both storefronts are cheaper on the other outlet.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-will-feature-epic-games-store-on-day-one/1100-6537980/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-06T12:31:55.752096

When you're slain in battle, you'll drop your Guardian Spirit, which will also contain all of the Amrita and Soul Cores you've obtained since last visiting a shrine. If you die again, it's all lost for good. Knowing this, you'll need to safely return to your grave and claim your Guardian Spirit, or you may end up very disappointed to see all of that progress lost. Luckily, you can also use a Summoner's Candle to call your Guardian Spirit back with all of your Amrita and Soul Cores intact--if you have one.</p><p>Summoner's Candles are a rare resource that isn't to be used in every instance of death. Saving them for the right moments, though, can make a world of difference and keep you from losing potentially hours of your hard-earned progression.

Nioh 3 - How To Transmog And Change Character Appearance,"<p>Look, challenging bosses and exploration are great, but part of the fun in any Soulslike game is customizing your character, armor, and weapons to suit your preferred aesthetic. What's the point in slaying your foes if you don't look cool doing it, right? That's where <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/nioh-3/"">Nioh 3</a>'s character creator and transmog (transmogrification) come into play, allowing you to change the appearance of your character and gear to ensure you're happy with your visual vibes. Below, we'll tell you where to access these features and how they work so that you don't have to spend another moment looking anything less than your best.</p><h2>How to transmog and change your character's appearance in Nioh 3</h2><p>To access the transmog and character creator features in Nioh 3, you'll need to visit the Eternal Rift. This is the game's main hub, where you'll frequently go to speak with characters or deal with weapon upgrades at the Blacksmith, so it's accessible early in your adventure after completing the first Crucible. <strong>To access the Eternal Rift at any point, simply open your map and press the left stick</strong>.</p><p>Once you arrive at the Eternal Rift, make your way to the northernmost building here.

How Long To Beat Nioh 3,"<p>The Nioh franchise has long been among the most punishing yet rewarding entries in the Soulslike genre, and <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/nioh-3/"">Nioh 3</a> doesn't mess too much with that formula. However, this new outing from developer Team Ninja does have some fresh tricks up its sleeves, such as an open field design and a less linear mission structure that provides players with substantially more freedom in how and when they tackle missions.</p><p>If you're interested in seeing what this third entry has to offer, you'll find a lengthy and difficult campaign ahead of you, as well as plenty of optional content to seek out that is all but certain to improve your chances of survival. Here's how long it takes to beat Nioh 3.</p><h2>How long to beat Nioh 3</h2><p>How long it takes to beat Nioh 3 will depend largely on how well you adapt to its frenetic combat and immensely demanding boss encounters. That being said, prioritizing the game's main content with the intent of simply <strong>reaching the credits should take an average of 30-40 hours </strong>for most players. Completionists, meanwhile, will be able to get even more from Nioh 3, as <strong>aiming to see everything the game has to offer can easily push the total playtime to 60-70 hours</strong>.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-long-to-beat-nioh-3/1100-6537311/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-06T12:31:55.752096
Assassin's Creed Multiplayer Game Reportedly Canceled,"<p>Last month, Ubisoft announced significant cuts and the cancellation of six games, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-canceled-as-ubisoft-axes-and-delays-multiple-projects/1100-6537546/"">including the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a>. At the time, there were no indications that Assassin's Creed franchise was in danger of losing any games in development, but a new report indicates that Assassin's Creed multiplayer game has now been canceled as well.</p><p>According to French gaming site <a href=""https://www.origami.ng/ubisoft-vantage-cancel-league-assassins-creed-multiplayer/"">Origami</a>, the project in question was given the codename Assassin's Creed League, and it would have allowed up to four players to work together on assassinations. AC League reportedly grew out of DLC originally created for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/"">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and may have also been set in the same era of Japanese history.</p><p>The game was said to be in development at Ubisoft Annecy, the studio that created the multiplayer modes for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-brotherhood/"">Assassin's Creed Brotherhood</a>, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-unity/"">Assassin's Creed Unity</a>, and <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/"">Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</a>.

Baldur's Gate 3 Is Getting An HBO Series And At Least One Person At Larian Isn’t Happy,"<p>All those steamy campfire scenes are about to get a whole lot hotter; According to <a href=""https://deadline.com/2026/02/baldurs-gate-3-tv-show-craig-mazin-hbo-1236710583/"">Deadline</a>, Baldur's Gate 3 is getting an HBO series. The show will reportedly take place after the game's events and is set to further expand its already robust-story. The Last of Us writer and director Craig Mazin is on board to create, write, produce, and showrun in what will be his second time adapting a critically acclaimed and seemingly universally beloved video game for television.</p><p>Seemingly not attached to the series, however, is Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian. Following the announcement, it was reported that Larian has <a href=""https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/2019563522339082576"">no involvement in the series</a>. One of the <a href=""https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2019565834931171660"">studio's developers</a> took to X to write, ""Imma bout to crash out on main,"" while <a href=""https://x.com/MightyKeef/status/2019568129974890700"">another user asked</a>, ""How are they allowed to do this if y’all didn’t give them the permission?""</p><p>Set in the Dungeon and Dragons universe, Baldur's Gate 3 follows a ragtag group of adventures forced to band together on a quest to remove their brain worms. No, really, that's the plot. Naturally things escalate from there--gods and cosmic forces get involved, as they are wont to do--but it all comes back to worms. However, what truly sets the game apart--and led to it being our <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2023/1100-6519739/"">Game of the Year</a> back in 2023--is its excellent cast, sense of freedom, branching story, and the unparalleled agency it gave its players; all of this makes it an interesting choice for a television adaptation that will presumably be linear and could feature different actors in place of player's beloved party members.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-getting-an-hbo-series-and-you-can-probably-guess-whos-writing-it/1100-6537976/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-06T12:31:55.752096
What Does Nintendo Have Against Leon S. Kennedy?,"<p>Near the end of this month, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-requiem/"">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is coming to Switch 2 and other platforms. But in today's <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7460/"">Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase</a>, we couldn't help but notice that fan-favorite Leon S. Kennedy was done dirty in Requiem preview. If Nintendo thought people wouldn't notice Leon wildly missing every shot, then it was greatly mistaken.

The title is set in the same world as the two previous Horizon games, except now up to three players will be able to team up and take on the lethal machine creatures that overrun the land.</p><p>In a post on Sony's <a href=""https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/05/announcing-horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrillas-new-co-op-action-game/"">official PlayStation site</a>, Guerrilla noted that the events of this game are canonical, and that the ""story doesn't stop at launch.""

In its first three days, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-is-the-ps4s-fastest-selling-new-/1100-6480131/"">Tsushima sold over 2.4 million units</a>.

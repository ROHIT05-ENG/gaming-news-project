My janky left shoulder is twinging, as it does when I get caught up doing computery things, and my heart is beating in the heels of my palms from deathgripping my controller. Frankly, this is just how movement-intense, combo-centric gaming feels when you're not a svelte, well-oiled machine anymore.

Its humour is pitch black, yes, and its comedic moments often dance on a knife's edge between laughter and revulsion, but writer and director Andrea Lucco Borlera's first-person narrative horror - his debut game, created in close collaboration with Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione - is a fascinatingly singular vision. It's singular enough, in fact, that it's not an easy thing to effectively describe, but if you can imagine a sort of thematic reinterpretation of Animal Farm by way of Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salo on one side, and a meme-able Garry's Mod video on the other, then Horses gleefully oscillates between them, landing somewhere in the middle.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-review"">Read more</a></p>",2025-12-10T13:49:55.934782

For bonus features, the Blu-ray includes a documentary on the making of Bugonia, interviews with the cast and crew, behind-the-scenes footage, and more.</p><h2><strong>Bugonia bonus materials</strong></h2><ul><li>The Birth and the Bees: The making of Bugonia</li><li>Interviews with Emma Stone, Jesse Plemons, and the rest of the cast and crew</li><li>Behind-the-scenes footage featuring the sets, music, and cinematography</li></ul></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G1TXHWJ3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20"">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                                                      <div>                        <a href=""https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Bugonia-Steelbook-4K-Ultra-HD-Blu-ray-Digital-Copy-Drama-Universal/18304413286&subId1=subid_value"">See at Walmart</a>           </div>                                                     </div>      </div>                                                                     <div class=""js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container"">             <h2 class=""item-title"">                    <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Bugonia-Collectors-Ultra-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B0G1TVSNDW?tag=gamespot-preorders-20"">Bugonia Standard Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=""item-deck"">                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Bugonia-Collectors-Ultra-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B0G1TVSNDW?tag=gamespot-preorders-20"">$33 | Releases December 23</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=""image-container"">                                  <img class=""main-image"" src=https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1601/16018044/4616688-bugonia-2.jpg>                             <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Bugonia-Collectors-Ultra-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B0G1TVSNDW?tag=gamespot-preorders-20""></a>                        </div>              <div class=""item-description""><p>The Bugonia standard edition features different cover art and a standard movie case, but includes the same special features as the steelbook edition.

The film follows two conspiracy-obsessed cousins (Plemons and Aidan Dobis) who are convinced that the CEO of a powerful company (Stone) is actually an alien in disguise, hellbent on wiping out humanity. After kidnapping and trapping her in their basement, the trio engages in a battle of wits, interrogation, and torture, with the film becoming increasingly unpredictable as it races towards its conclusion. While it wasn't a box-office hit, Bugonia did earn relatively high praise from critics and audiences alike thanks to the standout performances of the cast and its wild plot twists.</p><p>For more Blu-ray deals, you can check out various specials right now. <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-the-hobbit-trilogy-4k-blu-ray-box-set-deals/1100-6529053/"">The Hobbit Trilogy on 4K Blu-ray has gotten a big discount</a>, and the box set for the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-woo-a-better-tomorrow-trilogy-hong-kong-cinema-classics/1100-6534476/"">A Better Tomorrow Trilogy</a> has also gotten a substantial price cut.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bugonia-collectors-edition-4k-blu-ray-preorder-guide/1100-6536732/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-10T13:49:55.934782

Director Joachim Rønning and star Jared Leto appear in several of these short documentaries to talk about their passion for the Tron franchise, and several deleted scenes are also included.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Tron-Ares-Combo-Digital-Steelbook/dp/B0G4DWTWFR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20"">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                                                      <div>                        <a href=""https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Tron-Acres-Steelbook-4K-Ultra-HD-Blu-ray-Digital-Copy-Walt-Disney-Pictures-Action-Adventure-Sci-Fi/18799108567&subId1=subid_value"">See at Walmart</a>           </div>                                                     </div>      </div>                                                                     <div class=""js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container"">             <h2 class=""item-title"">                    <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Tron-Ares-UHD-Combo-Digital/dp/B0G4DZLVSQ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20"">Tron: Ares (4K Blu-ray)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=""item-deck"">                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Tron-Ares-UHD-Combo-Digital/dp/B0G4DZLVSQ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20"">$50 - 30 | Releases January 6, 2026</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=""image-container"">                                  <img class=""main-image"" src=https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1601/16018044/4615673-tron-2.jpg>                             <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Tron-Ares-UHD-Combo-Digital/dp/B0G4DZLVSQ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20""></a>                        </div>              <div class=""item-description""><p>The regular 4K edition features a cover based on the Tron: Ares poster that featured a gravity-defying lightcycle ride up a skyscraper.

The movie grossed only $142 million worldwide and received lukewarm critical reception at best. Audience reviews have been kinder, and while the film may not have reached the same heights as the original Tron or 2010's Tron: Legacy, there is still appreciation for how it pushes the franchise's concepts further and for its hard-hitting Nine Inch Nails soundtrack. Unlike the Tron movies, which were set on the digital frontier of the Grid, Tron: Ares explores the ramifications of that world crossing over into ours. Centered around Ares, a highly sophisticated Program, the movie chronicles the first meeting between humanity and digital AI beings.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tron-ares-blu-ray-preorder-gui/1100-6536664/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-10T13:49:55.934782
Call Of Duty Will No Longer Do Back-To-Back Black Ops Or Modern Warfare Games,"<p>Activision is making a major strategic shift with the Call of Duty series that will affect it for years to come. Following the less-than-stellar response to Black Ops 7, the franchise will no longer get back-to-back entries in the same sub-series. This applies not only to Black Ops, but also to Modern Warfare.</p><p>""We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games,"" Activision said in the <a href=""https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team"">official announcement</a>. ""The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year.""</p><p>Alongside this announcement, Activision promised ""meaningful, not incremental"" innovation for the series' future. It didn't specify exactly what this would mean, instead stressing it would share more ""when the time is right.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-10T13:49:55.934782

Games Weren't A Big Part Of Netflix's Attempted WB Takeover,"<p>Last week, Netflix put forth <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-announces-purchase-of-warner-bros-for-over-82-billion/1100-6536717/"">an $82 million deal to purchase Warner Bros. Studios</a>, one of the biggest movie and TV studios in the world. Warner Bros. also has a considerable place in the video game industry with franchises like <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/netflix-could-own-all-these-warner-bros-game-studios-soon/2900-7310/"">Batman, Harry Potter, and Mortal Kombat</a> under its domain. However, one Netflix executive has now acknowledged that Warner Bros.' gaming division wasn't a significant factor in considering its bid.</p><p>During <a href=""https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_events/2025/Dec/08/UBS-Tech-Conf-Transcript-12-8-2025.pdf"">a Netflix conference call</a> about the potential WB sale, co-CEO Gregory K. Peters expressed some eagerness to exploit the video game franchises under Warner Bros. in the future. But he added that the games were ""relatively minor"" in the company's initial plans and that it may be ""worth going back again to sort of how we thought about the deal and building our valuation model.""</p><p>""While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn’t attribute any value to that from the get-go because they're relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things,"" continued Peters. ""Now we are super excited because some of those properties that they've built--[Hogwarts Legacy] is a great example of that--have been done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we're offering. They've got great studios and great folks working there. So we think that there's definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven't built that into our deal model.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/games-werent-a-big-part-of-netflixs-attempted-wb-takeover/1100-6536812/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-10T13:49:55.934782

"Divinity Original Sin 3 Not Happening Now At Larian, Nor Is A Toilet Simulator","<p>In the lead-up to The Game Awards, there has been some speculation that the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geoff-keighleys-demonic-game-awards-monolith-has-been-spotted-in-la/1100-6536779/"">scary monolith teaser</a> was for Divinity: Original Sin 3, but developer Larian has now clarified it's not making that game.

"The Game Awards Creator Hears Your Feedback --""Do We Always Get It Right?

"Sony's PS5 ""Must-Play"" Games Of 2026 Video Includes Halo But Not GTA 6","<p>After 25 years of being exclusive on console to Xbox, Microsoft's Halo series is headed to PlayStation in 2026 with <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6535992/"">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>. With the year coming to a close, Sony has published a video highlighting some of the ""must-play"" titles coming to PS5 in 2026, and Halo got a special shoutout in the video, while <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/"">GTA 6</a> was not mentioned.</p><p>Seeing Halo promoted so heavily by Sony would have been unthinkable not long ago, and the comments on the video reflect this. The top comment on the video states, ""Seeing Halo here is still surreal."" Someone else said, ""It feels so weird seeing Halo being advertised by PlayStation.""</p><p>Others have pointed out that Rockstar's GTA 6 is not mentioned in the video, with people taking this to mean, or suggest, that Sony is concerned that Rockstar could push the game to 2027. But there could be any number of reasons why GTA 6 was left out. Rockstar, after all, is highly protective of its own game assets. To be sure, it is a giant leap to say that GTA 6 not being featured in video means the game won't make it out on time in 2026.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-ps5-must-play-games-of-2026-video-includes-halo-but-not-gta-6/1100-6536806/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-10T13:49:55.934782

"Arc Raiders Cold Snap Update: Start Date, New Map Condition, And Everything We Know So Far","<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a> has been the talk of the town in the multiplayer arena over the past two months, landing a nomination for Best Multiplayer Game at <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/"">The Game Awards</a> and becoming one of the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/these-were-the-top-15-most-popular-games-last-week-in-the-us/2900-7295/"">most played games in recent weeks</a>. As players prep for this month's upcoming Expedition--an optional wipe that resets much of their progress in exchange for in-game rewards--they'll also be treated to the fresh Cold Snap update. This new content includes an additional snow-based map condition, a premium Raider Deck, and another event to complete for goodies. Here's everything we know about it so far.</p><div data-embed-type=""toc""><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a href=""https://www.gamespot.com"">hide</a>]</span><ul id=""toc_list"" class=""collapse in""><li><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com"">Cold Snap release date</a></li></ul></div><h2 id=""Cold_Snap_release_date"">Cold Snap release date</h2><p>Arc Raiders' Cold Snap update will release on <strong>December 16, 2025</strong>. While we don't know an exact launch time for this update yet, the previous North Line update launched at 1:30 AM PT / 4:30 AM ET, so it's safe to assume this one may also launch in the wee hours of the morning for US-based players.</p><p>The Cold Snap update falls just one day before the Expedition window opens, which will allow players to send their raider off and reset much of their in-game progress any time before December 22. This should give dedicated players at least a few days to see this fresh content on their current raider before sending them off and starting anew.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-cold-snap-update-start-date/1100-6536803/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-10T13:49:55.934782
WoW Player Houses Are Now Officially Allowed To Fly,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/"">World of Warcraft</a> players are pushing the game's new player-housing system to its limit, including defying the laws of gravity in a way Blizzard never intended. But rather than fix the ability to send houses skyward, Blizzard is instead embracing it.</p><p dir=""ltr"">When housing first arrived on December 2 as part of patch 11.2.7, it didn't take long for players to discover that, while the UI didn't show it, houses could actually be lifted off the ground using keybinds. The result was players making all kinds of airborne housing creations, including elaborate treehouses, airships, mechs, homes held up by kites, and everything in between.</p><p dir=""ltr"">In a <a href=""https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/housing-development-notes-updated-december-9/2207508/5"">forum post</a>, WoW community manager Randy Jordan (aka Kaivax) stated that instead of fixing the ability to elevate houses, Blizzard has with this week's scheduled maintenance actually made it easier by enabling proper controls to move houses upward.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-houses-are-now-officially-allowed-to-fly/1100-6536801/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-10T13:49:55.934782

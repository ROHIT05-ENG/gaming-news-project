Its humour is pitch black, yes, and its comedic moments often dance on a knife's edge between laughter and revulsion, but writer and director Andrea Lucco Borlera's first-person narrative horror - his debut game, created in close collaboration with Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione - is a fascinatingly singular vision. It's singular enough, in fact, that it's not an easy thing to effectively describe, but if you can imagine a sort of thematic reinterpretation of Animal Farm by way of Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salo on one side, and a meme-able Garry's Mod video on the other, then Horses gleefully oscillates between them, landing somewhere in the middle.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-review"">Read more</a></p>",2025-12-05T13:43:55.406332

On the other, it is something new for the series, structurally most comparable not to other Metroid games but rather to a different Nintendo adventure franchise (more on that shortly).

A colour palette shift - swapping the bleached-out ethereal hues of <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus"">Shadow of the Colossus</a> on PS2 for a more natural lighting, say - might add a bit of beautification, but it can radically alter the intended tone. More egregiously, Bluepoint's decision to redesign chunks of Demon's Souls using a completely different architectural style isn't just an artistic choice, it has significant ramifications for world-building.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/last-years-brilliant-silent-hill-2-is-finally-on-xbox-series-xs-and-its-exactly-what-a-remake-should-be"">Read more</a></p>",2025-12-05T13:43:55.406332

Avatar DLC Hands-On: How The New Movie Sets Frontiers Of Pandora's World Aflame,"<p dir=""ltr"">When it was released in 2023, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/"">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> succeeded in the daunting task of <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-review-the-good-blue-man-group/1900-6418162/"">bringing its own kind of life to the world of James Cameron's Avatar movies</a>. Developer Massive Entertainment wisely chose not to retell the story of the films, instead weaving a tale on the other side of the moon of Pandora where the films take place.</p><p dir=""ltr"">But while Frontiers excelled at turning the dense, visually fascinating world of Pandora into a cogent, interactive space and exploring the culture of the Na'vi peoples who populate it, the game also felt somewhat disconnected from the movies. With the release of the third Avatar movie, Avatar: Fire and Ash, Massive is taking the opportunity to adjust that situation a bit.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Alongside the movie hitting theaters comes From the Ashes, an expansion for the game that tells a new story that incorporates major elements from the film, while also shaking up Frontiers' take on Pandora in some very big ways. Massive worked closely with Cameron's production company, Lightstorm Entertainment, to bring the stories of the movie and the game a little closer together.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-dlc-hands-on-how-the-new-movie-sets-frontiers-of-pandoras-world-aflame/1100-6536707/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-05T13:43:55.406332

The episodes are upscaled to 1080p and are presented in their original 16:9 aspect ratio. The set comes with a stylish display case, six art cards, and the three discs even have concept art printed on the labels. Special features include promotional videos, trailers, an image gallery, concept art, and textless opening/closing credit sequences.</p><p> </p><p>Like Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo blends striking visuals, meticulously animated fight scenes, and contemporary music to create an anime that is oozing with style. For Samurai Champloo, Watanabe opted for the jazzy beats and street fashion aesthetics of underground hip-hop.</p><p>The show is set in alternate Edo-era Japan and follows the young waitress Fuu and her two unlikely companions--the outlaw Mugen and the ronin Ji--on an adventure to find a mysterious samurai who smells of sunflowers.</p><p>Samurai Champloo often ranks high on lists of the best anime--though admittedly not <i>quite </i>as high as Bebop. Nevertheless, it's well worth picking up while it's on sale.</p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDT5CXNG?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>                                                                     <div class=""js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container"">             <h2 class=""item-title"">                    <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&isPreview=1&asins=B00NP06DJE,B0BSMKGBFW&tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Cowboy Bebop: The Complete Series (Blu-ray)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=""item-deck"">                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&isPreview=1&asins=B00NP06DJE,B0BSMKGBFW&tag=gamespot-promos-20"">$27 (was $60)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=""image-container"">                                  <img class=""main-image"" src=https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1595/15950357/4616496-4552103-cowboybebop.png>                             <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&isPreview=1&asins=B00NP06DJE,B0BSMKGBFW&tag=gamespot-promos-20""></a>                        </div>              <div class=""item-description""><p>Widely considered one of, if not, <em>the</em> best anime series of all time, Cowboy Bebop is a sci-fi western about bounty hunters Spike and Jet, who eke out a living chasing down targets across the solar system.

One peculiar Ditto returns to find the land withered, and its only remaining resident is a Tangrowth, known simply as Professor Tangrwoth. Using its transformation powers to pass itself off as a human, the Ditto works to restore the land and inspire other Pokemon to return.</p><p>Players won't just be limited to one island, as the Ditto can transform into a Lapras or Dragonite to reach new locations. Crafting also plays a big role in Pokemon Pokopia, as collected materials can be fashioned into tools and infrastructure to improve buildings and complete quests.</p><p> </p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G1VH7HZ1?tag=gamespot-preorders-20"">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                                                      <div>                        <a href=""https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Pok-mon-Pokopia/18555463299&subId1=subid_value"">See at Walmart</a>           </div>                                                                                                             <div>                        <a href=""https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1804712/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fpokemon-pokopia-nintendo-switch-2%2FJ7GSL5JVH5%2Fsku%2F6665027&partnerpropertyid=1423009"">See at Best Buy</a>           </div>                                    </div>      </div>   </div> </div><p>Pokemon Pokopia will be the first Nintendo-published game for Switch 2 to be released as a Game Key Card. This means the physical cartridge will serve as an authentication device, and you'll still need to download the full game to your console. It is worth noting that Game Key Cards are not tied to your console, so you can resell them in the future if you choose to. The game will take up roughly 10GBs of space--so if you're planning to buy the game, you'll want to consider picking up a microSD Express card to increase your storage capacity. Luckily, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-nintendo-switch-2-best-deals-available-now/1100-6530578/"">Amazon currently has a great deal on</a> the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Express-microSDXC-Nintendo-AM/dp/B0FT995SPF?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Samsung P9 512GB</a> card.

Splitgate: Arena Reloaded Will Relaunch The Halo-Meets-Portal Shooter After A Rough Year,"<p>After some very public missteps and an <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-2-is-reverting-to-beta-og-servers-shutting-down/1100-6533350/"">unprecedented return to beta</a>, Splitgate is hoping to make a comeback under a new name. At the PC Games Show, 1047 Games announced that Splitgate 2 will return as Splitgate: Arena Reloaded on December 17, with massive gameplay and progression changes that aim to bring the shooter closer to its roots.</p><p>According to 1047 Games design director Josh Watson, the studio has been rebuilding the game ""from the ground up,"" incorporating and refining the best elements from both Splitgate games while ""removing what didn't work."" In a video announcement, Watson specifically cited Unreal Tournament, Quake, and Halo as the main inspirations for Splitgate.</p><p>To that end, the rebooted Splitgate will lack the Factions and Abilities introduced in Splitgate 2 for a more ""classic arena combat"" experience. Arena Reloaded also contains retooled progression and ranked systems, along with reduced in-game store prices; Splitgate 2's microtransactions were a major pain point with players when the game first launched.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-arena-reloaded-will-relaunch-the-halo-meets-portal-shooter-after-a-rough-year/1100-6536677/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-05T13:43:55.406332

Metroid Prime 4 Has Optional Music Locked Behind $30 Paywall,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond/"">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is out this week, ending an 18-year hiatus between this game and the release of <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-prime-3-corruption/"">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a> in 2007. Samus Aran picks up a few new tricks in this sequel, including her new bike, the Vi-O-La. But if you want to hear some optional ambient music while Samus cruises the deserts of planet Viewros, it's going to cost you $30 or the price of a Samus Aran Amiibo.</p><p>Players have discovered that plugging in the Samus Amiibo enables Vi-O-La Radio, which enables players to choose the music that accompanies Samus's extended journey across the Sol Valley desert on the Vi-O-La. There is already some ambient music and noise to go with those scenes, this just allows players to choose music tracks from other areas to listen to. Finishing the game will also unlock two additional tracks for Vi-O-La Radio. </p><p>The regular ambient music of Sol Valley doesn't make it a bad experience, and it seems to be evoking something thematically about the planet's history. The music may not be necessary, but some fans may resent having to pay for an option that could have just as easily been included in the base game.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-has-optional-music-locked-behind-30-paywall/1100-6536713/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-05T13:43:55.406332
Hello Sunshine Is A Survival Game With A Literally Massive Twist,"<p dir=""ltr"">You'd be forgiven for losing track of how many <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-games/2900-5289/"">survival games</a> have come out in the last decade or so, and though I personally enjoy many of them myself, it's exciting to see a new one come along and dramatically overhaul what a survival game looks like, mechanically speaking. In a crowded genre, Hello Sunshine stands out. Yes, it's a survival game with many of the mechanics you'd expect, but it doesn't look quite like any others, thanks to its one (literally) huge twist.</p><p dir=""ltr"">That twist is the gigantic robot companion you have by your side. The building-sized automaton walks almost ceaselessly toward a destination, and it's your mission to use its shadow to stay safe from the scorching sun, while strategically dashing into landmarks to quickly loot supplies, all while you dodge other, smaller bots along the way.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_2NcnBVZ4o"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S_2NcnBVZ4o"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir=""ltr"">Hello Sunshine is set in a post-apocalyptic world full of antagonistic robots, and if you're to survive, you'll need to scavenge food, water, and materials to build tools and weapons--all while avoiding the unforgiving rays of the sun. But rather than settle down and build a base for yourself and your robo-pal, you're almost always on the move. It's a much more nomadic experience than, say, Valheim or Minecraft.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hello-sunshine-is-a-survival-game-with-a-literally-massive-twist/1100-6536710/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-05T13:43:55.406332
Just Cause Creator Revs Up With New Action Game Samson,"<p>In 2020, Just Cause creator and Avalanche Studios founder Christofer Sundberg started a new company, Liquid Swords, alongside other industry veterans. Now, the team at Liquid Swords has shared the first trailer for its debut action title, Samson: A Tyndalston Story. It may remind some fans of Grand Theft Auto, but there are differences that make it a lot harder to earn money in this game.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQ4z_yQE5Xo"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OQ4z_yQE5Xo"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Tyndalston is the name of the city, and players will step into the role of Samson McCray, an aging criminal who is facing a crushing debt. Players can steal the money they need, but this isn't like other open-world crime games where you can keep going non-stop. Samson has physical limits as to what he can pull off in a day, which are measured by action points. Use too many on a single job and you won't be able to do much else.</p><p>As time passes in this world, your debt increases. For every crime you commit, the city remembers and your reputation grows. According to Liquid Swords, ""There are no do-overs. You move forward because standing still makes everything worse."" This is a story about debt, consequences, and survival. Samson will have to deal with all three on a daily basis.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/just-cause-creator-revs-up-with-new-action-game-samson/1100-6536711/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-05T13:43:55.406332
Best Warzone And BO7 Perks For Season 1,"<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/"">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> has integrated with <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/"">Warzone</a> for Season 1, adding the full BO7 weapon pool, attachments, and other gear into battle royale. The big update also overhauls Warzone's perk system, so here we'll highlight all the perks in the game and include some recommended picks for your next match of battle royale.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Season 1 removes the Wildcard perks from Black Ops 6, and instead, you'll have Overkill by default. This means you can equip a second primary weapon without the need to select any specific perks to your loadouts.</p><p dir=""ltr"">The update also changes how some of the perks work in Warzone. Popular choices from last year may not be as beneficial this year, while other perks are buffed to be much more viable for Black Ops 7's integration.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-warzone-and-bo7-perks-for-season-1/1100-6536712/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-05T13:43:55.406332

This is apparent when looking at the relatively small lists of upcoming games at any given time. PlayStation itself has only published a few games for the platform, though there are some notable AAA PS5 games with cool PSVR 2 modes, including Gran Turismo 7 and the Resident Evil 4 remake.</p><p>That said, the PlayStation VR 2 does have a pretty big library thanks to ports of VR games from other platforms. The PlayStation Store has more than 350 compatible games. The library expands exponentially if you have a VR-compatible PC and the accessory below.</p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Horizon-MountainTM-Bundle-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1Q9X8VH?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                                                      <div>                        <a href=""https://sonyps.prf.hn/click/camref:1110l56fv/pubref:gamespot/ar:subid_value/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-consoles%2Fplaystationvr2-horizon-call-of-the-mountain-bundle"">See at PS Direct</a>           </div>                                                                                                             <div>                        <a href=""https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/PlayStation-VR2-Horizon-Call-of-the-Mountain-Bundle/3333660564&subId1=subid_value"">See at Walmart</a>           </div>                                    </div>      </div>                                                                     <div class=""js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container"">             <h2 class=""item-title"">                    <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D92XQL22?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">PSVR 2 PC Adapter</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=""item-deck"">                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D92XQL22?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">$60</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=""image-container"">                                  <img class=""main-image"" src=https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1595/15950357/4501013-psvr2adapter.jpg>                             <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D92XQL22?tag=gamespot-promos-20""></a>                        </div>              <div class=""item-description""><p>PlayStation added PC support to the PSVR 2 last year, which instantly made the headset one of the most enticing options for PC players.

Here's This Week's Free Game From The Epic Games Store On Mobile,"<p>For the last couple of years, the Epic Games Store has given away free games every week through its PC storefront. With the company having launched its own mobile store, it has also started a second free games program on iOS and Android devices, kicking things off with a curated library of titles and weekly freebies. The app also features mobile versions of Fortnite, Fall Guys, and Rocket League Sideswipe.</p><p>To access these games you will need to <a href=""https://www.epicgames.com/id/register"">create a free Epic account</a> and install the free Epic Games Store mobile app and log in with your account, but once you do, you can start claiming your free games every Thursday through it.

Iron Lung's success can almost certainly be attributed to its links with mega-popular YouTuber Mark Edward Fischbach - better known as Markiplier - for whom the project's clearly been a labour of love, given he not only self-funded it, but wrote it, directed it, and starred in it too.

Cats are often delightful reprobates and oddballs. They're needlessly, inventively cruel, or inhumanly calm and forbearing, or they're ostentatiously silly. One will sit on the landing and swipe at everyone. Another will hide under a bath mat, certain that they have attained complete invisibility.

Dev Gets 3D Visuals Working On Game Boy Color,"<p>The Game Boy Color was an 8-Bit system that debuted in 1998 nearly a decade after the original Game Boy. Given the technical limitations of that era, few would have believed it was possible to create 3D images with a Game Boy Color. And yet nearly three decades after its release, a fan modder has successfully done so.</p><p>Danny Spencer created real-time 3D images on the Game Boy Color and shared <a href=""https://blog.otterstack.com/posts/202512-gbshader/"">a blog post</a> (via <a href=""https://www.pcguide.com/news/27-years-later-someone-has-made-realtime-3d-graphics-possible-on-the-game-boy-color/"">PC Guide</a>) where he explained at length how it was done. The short version is that Spencer had to come up with a workaround for the Game Boy Color's inability to calculate 3D graphics. His solution was to include the completed calculations and convert the resulting vectors into spherical coordinates. </p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAQXEW3ePwo"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"" data-video-start=""71"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SAQXEW3ePwo?start=71"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>For the purposes of this demo, Spencer only created a 3D model of a teapot and a Game Boy Color.

Diablo 4: Lord Of Hatred Puts Badass Amazons Front And Center,"<p dir=""ltr"">Diablo 4's next expansion, Lord of Hatred, is more than just another chapter in the Diablo universe. Since its release in back in 2023, Diablo 4 has told a singular story referred to as The Hatred Saga; as its events have unfolded, we've found our character, The Wanderer, at the center of a battle between Heaven, Hell, Sanctuary, and one <em>extremely</em> messy family. However, all of that is about to come to a close, as Lord of Hatred sees us reunite with the game's former antagonist, Lilith, in an epic showdown against Mephisto that will both explore Sanctuary's past and settle its future.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Ahead of Lord of Hatred's April 28 release date, developer Blizzard showcased the expansion--and its upcoming <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warlock-is-diablos-newest-class-and-its-coming-to-almost-every-diablo-game/1100-6538085/"">Warlock</a> class--in a Spotlight presentation.

StarCraft Shooter Reportedly In Works At Arc Raiders Publisher,"<p>Nexon, parent company of Embark and its successful extraction shooter <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a>, is reportedly working on a shooter set in the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/starcraft/"">StarCraft</a> universe in collaboration with Blizzard.</p><p>A recent article by <a href=""https://www.dnews.co.kr/uhtml/view.jsp?idxno=202601301526154230994"">The Korea Economic Daily</a>, reported by <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzards-latest-attempt-at-a-starcraft-shooter-reportedly-in-development-at-nexon"">IGN</a>, suggests that Nexon has the project underway in one of its shooter divisions, with a former StarCraft modder at the helm. This is the second time that Nexon has been reported to be working with the franchise, with South Korean financial news outlet MTN reporting in early 2025 that the publisher had <a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/nexon-wins-the-bidding-war-to-make-a-new-starcraft-as-well-as-distribute-a-blizzard-mobile-game-thats-being-called-overwatch-3/"">secured the license from Blizzard</a> after pitching its ideas to the StarCraft creators.</p><p>The Korea Economic Daily caveats its reporting with the fact that Nexon has previously attempted to license properties in a similar way from Square Enix, but has yet to launch a product. This isn't the first time a StarCraft shooter has been rumored, however, with reporting from earlier this year suggesting that <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starcraft-shooter-likely-to-be-revealed-at-blizzcon-report-suggests/1100-6537249/"">Blizzard is planning to reveal the project at BlizzCon 2026</a>. The existence of a StarCraft shooter has predated that report, too, with the project being mentioned in Jason Schreier's book Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment in 2024.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starcraft-shooter-reportedly-in-works-at-arc-raiders-publisher/1100-6538117/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-12T12:37:01.002676

"Blizzard Boss Teases ""Exciting Conversations"" About Hollywood Adaptations","<p>Ten years ago, one of Blizzard's most-popular franchises hit the big screen in Warcraft, but there haven't been any further adaptations of the company's IP. In the decade since Warcraft hit theaters, video game adaptations have heated up again. According to Blizzard president Johanna Faries, studios are still knocking on the company's door. But it may take more than they can offer to get them off the ground.</p><p>During a recent profile by <a href=""https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/johanna-faries-blizzard-35-anniversary-interview"">Windows Central</a>, Faries indicated that ""exciting conversations"" have taken place about new adaptations. She also noted that Blizzard is focused on the quality of any TV shows or movies based on its games.</p><p>""We just want to be responsible with the IP, right?,"" said Faries. ""We want to make sure that if we bring anything forward, whether it's gameplay or whether it's beyond that, that it represents what we want it to signify. On behalf of Blizzard, it's got to be best in class ... we have set the bar in many ways, in terms of creative excellence, and so that's really what we're going to focus in on.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-boss-teases-exciting-conversations-about-hollywood-adaptations/1100-6538113/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-12T12:37:01.002676

Mewgenics Just Beat The Binding of Isaac's Concurrent Player Record,"<p>Mewgenics has already bested Binding of Isaac: Rebirth's concurrent-player record, just over 24 hours since release.

Mewgenics is also leagues above most of McMillan's other releases, in term of concurrent player count.

It is a roguelike-tactics game where you command a platoon of cats through three torturous acts. Any kittens who survive the onslaught become the parents to a new generation of feline warriors. The game won big praise from reviewer Jason Rodriguez, who said in GameSpot's 9/10 <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mewgenics-review-a-near-purrfect-roguelite-adventure/1900-6418456/"">Mewgenics review</a>, ""Although it can easily overwhelm you with a high degree of complexity early on, this gradually gives way to an appreciation for the many strategic layers cleverly constructed amongst the chaos.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mewgenics-just-beat-the-binding-of-isaacs-concurrent-player-record/1100-6538112/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-12T12:37:01.002676

"GTA 6 Could Help Make 2026 Gaming's Biggest Year Ever, Analysts Say","<p>GTA 6 and ongoing Switch 2 sales could make 2026 a massive year for the video game industry. Marketing data firm Circana has predicted that GTA 6 will help fuel a record-breaking year, projecting a total income of $62.8 billion. That number would exceed 2021's previous record of $61.7 billion and would represent a 3% growth over 2025, which broke $60.7 billion.</p><p dir=""ltr"">GTA 6 represents the highest ""purchase intent"" recorded since Circana began tracking the metric. The firm also predicts the game's sales will help drive accessory and subscription purchases. The Switch 2 is already <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/"">the fastest-selling console of all-time</a>; Circana predicts the momentum will continue into 2026. Subscription services like PlayStation Plus and Xbox Game Pass were also major drivers of revenue in 2025 and are expected to continue to grow in the current year.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Additionally, Circana's report emphasizes that 2026 has a set of challenges. Rising hardware costs, escalating prices in other economic sectors, and the increasing popularity of free-to-play PC and mobile games like Roblox and Fortnite could shake up the industry. The release of the Steam Machine could also represent a significant shift in the market.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-could-help-make-2026-gamings-biggest-year-ever-analysts-say/1100-6538110/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-12T12:37:01.002676
"Wait, Masters Of Albion Is Chapter One In A Planned Trilogy?","<p>Despite saying last year that his upcoming god game <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/masters-of-albion/"">Masters Of Albion</a> would be his last game, English game designer Peter Molyneux has claimed that this game is actually just one chapter in a planned trilogy.</p><p><a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/masters-of-albion-peter-molyneuxs-culmination-of-his-work-to-date-will-launch-in-early-access-as-actually-the-first-chapter-in-a-planned-trilogy"">Speaking to IGN on February 11</a>, Molyneux said that Masters of Albion will launch in early access as chapter one in a three-part ""epic."" It's a ""complete game"" that will feature the familiar beats of the hero's journey.</p><p>""So this is an epic,” Molyneux said. ""We are thinking about three epic chapters, I suppose you'd call them. Then what we'll be releasing into early access will be chapter one, and it's going to take us quite a few years to get to chapter three. But this chapter one, it has a story. It starts as a classic story of a hero coming and finding his power. There was an adversary who was doing something awful. There was a confrontation. It's a classic. This first chapter is a classic beat of that narrative story. There's going to be love, loss, hate, and betrayal in that first episode of the story. So it is a complete game. We are just thinking bigger rather than, 'Right, this is the game. That's it.' We've always been thinking about this bigger story.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wait-masters-of-albion-is-chapter-one-in-a-planned-trilogy/1100-6538111/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-12T12:37:01.002676
"This New Starship Troopers Boomer Shooter Is Out Next Month, Do You Want To Know More?","<p>The 1997 film Starship Troopers is a nuanced satire of fascism and ultraviolence. No one really cares about that, though, because the franchise is at its best when the focus is on squashing bugs. Developer Auroch Digital (Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun) is looking to do its part with Starship Troopers: Ultimate Bug War, a first-person boomer-shooter that looks like it was pulled straight out of the late '90s. It's launching on March 16 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2, <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/2321780/Starship_Troopers_Ultimate_Bug_War/"">and a PC demo is now available</a>. Do you want to know more?</p><p>Similar to its work on Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun, Auroch Digital has gone with an action-first approach and low-polygon graphics for this Starship Troopers game. Players will get to lead troops through battlefields infested with bugs, wield an arsenal of over 30 weapons--including the classic Morita autorifle, mechs, and tactical nukes--and take part in a campaign that's peppered with FMVs featuring General Johnny Rico, who is once again played by actor Casper Van Dien.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc5KpCp-CFU"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tc5KpCp-CFU"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Starship Troopers has maintained a video game presence over the years, with recent entries including the real-time strategy game <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/starship-troopers-terran-command/"">Starship Troopers: Terran Command</a> in 2022 and the 2024 FPS <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/starship-troopers-extermination/"">Starship Troopers: Extermination</a>.

Resident Evil 4 PC Performance Drastically Worsened By New DRM Update - Report,"<p>Following growing speculation that Resident Evil 4's latest patch has negatively affected its performance on PC, <a href=""https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2026/02/tested-resident-evil-4-remakes-new-pc-drm-impacts-cpu-performance"">Digital Foundry</a> has confirmed this through its own testing.</p><p>The outlet tested both the current and previous version of the game (by way of a mod), with the core difference between the two being the type of DRM implemented. Previously, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/"">Resident Evil 4</a> made use of Denuvo DRM, while its latest update has replaced it with Enigma Protector DRM. This new version of DRM has introduced major bottlenecks when it comes to CPU performance, with Digital Foundry measuring nearly 2ms lost to CPU processing times in some instances.</p><p>With its testing setup that prioritized CPU-limited scenarios, this manifested a massive decrease in output frame rate, down to 144fps from 217fps. It should be noted that these slowdowns won't be as noticeable, if at all, in GPU-limited scenarios, or in instances where the game's AI is providing a larger overhead than the new DRM features. Still, it's an example of an update measurably changing the performance of a product years after release without any real benefit to its players.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-4-pc-performance-drastically-worsened-by-new-drm-update-report/1100-6538107/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-12T12:37:01.002676

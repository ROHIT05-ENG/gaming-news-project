Raw power went aside with the Wii, but the company's dedication to tinkering around the edges to create stand-out original experiences in other ways remained - or perhaps even intensified. There's been a lot of examples over the years, of course, from clever game design innovations to zany peripherals - but <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza"">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has to be one of the finest showcases of that thinking from Nintendo in years.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-might-not-be-the-best-game-of-the-year-but-its-surely-the-one-i-loved-the-most"">Read more</a></p>",2026-01-03T12:19:15.735822

The Magic Of Peak Is Its Lost-like Lore,"<p dir=""ltr"">Four scouts on an end-of-year trip, flying across the world for what should be a life-changing experience. What could go wrong? An engine malfunction. The squad crash-lands somewhere in the Pacific. They’re the only survivors on a mysterious island that only grows stranger the deeper they venture and the longer they stay. This is <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peak-players-are-passing-time-at-the-airport-in-increasingly-elaborate-ways/1100-6535123/"">Peak</a>.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Sound familiar? The stories of Lost, the Emmy-winning 2004 mystery-laden drama series, and Peak feel like two parallel tracks that move in an eerily similar and magnificent way. The mystery only grows--in both depth and complexity--the further you get, whether you’re marathoning episodes or climbing up a volcano in search of rescue.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Lost worked because of that mystery. A group that crash-landed on an isolated island runs into underground bunkers, hidden groups of strangers, and a smoke monster as they try to survive and find their way home. Every new discovery widens the gap between what you think you understand and what’s actually happening.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-magic-of-peak-is-its-lost-like-lore/1100-6537069/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-03T12:19:15.735822
The Mojave Wasteland Is Broken Beyond Repair In Fallout Season 2 Episode 3,"<p><strong><em>Spoilers</em> for this week's episode of Fallout to follow.</strong></p><p>This week’s Fallout episode gave audiences a look into the status quo of the factions fighting for control of the Mojave Wasteland. While gamers might have an idea of where they ended up after finishing Fallout: New Vegas, it seems that a lot has changed in the wasteland in the 15 years since. While the meter didn’t move too much on individual stories, it was great to see what some of these fan favorite factions are currently up to.</p><p>The episode opens up in a bottling plant for the infamous Sunset Sarsaparilla, the Mojave’s favorite drink. The plant is being operated under the watchful eye of none other than former Brotherhood of Steel Squire Thaddeus (Johnny Pemberton), who’s taking on a far more ghoulish look than when we last saw him. After consoling a young girl who was bullied, he reminds the children to get back to work and that normally they’d “be dead by now.”</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-mojave-wasteland-is-broken-beyond-repair-in-fallout-season-2-episode-3/1100-6537151/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-03T12:19:15.735822
This Week’s Fallout Episode Brought Back A Fan-Favorite Character,"<p>This week’s Fallout episode traded in personal stories for status updates on fan-favorite factions from Fallout: New Vegas. While we briefly saw the Khans and primary followed the Brotherhood of Steel storyline, we finally got caught up with the NCR and Caesar’s Legion.

After selling out in the lead-up to Christmas and again on New Year's Eve, the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Minifigure 6-Pack is available for $30 at Amazon on January 1. Resellers have been selling Spider-Verse mystery boxes for around $50, so Amazon will probably sell out again soon. While you're on Amazon, you should also check out the newly released <strong><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Marvel-Morales-Spider-Man-Building/dp/B0FMS81CZK?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Miles Morales Mech vs. Spider-Man 2099 Lego set</a></strong>, which is only $15 and is also based on Across the Spider-Verse; it's one of <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FMS91VM1,B0FMS6YHHV,B0FMS5T4MN,B0FMS7W6RC,B0FMS81CZK,B0FMS8HGFB,B0FMSD393S,B0FMS8XPT8,B0FMS744YK,B0FMSVHZ4F,B0FMS7J8JL,B0FMS8VHYM&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20"">12 new Lego Marvel models and playsets</a> available at Amazon.</p><p>If you're interested in collecting this Lego minifigure series, now's the time to grab a box or two. Spider-Verse minifigures are sold out at all other major retailers and the Lego Store. Most retailers sold out shortly after the collection launched in September and never restocked the mystery boxes or singles. And with the new <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Minifigures-Animal-28-Pack/dp/B0FMS8VQKD?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Lego Minifigure Animal Series 28 Collection</a> now available, it's unlikely the Spider-Verse minifigures stick around for much longer.</p><p>The Spider-Verse Lego minifigure collection includes 12 characters from the animated film series. Each minifigure comes with a stand and most also have an accessory.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-minifigures-marvel-spider-man-spider-verse-collection-2025-buying-guide/1100-6533603/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-03T12:19:15.735822

"The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy Is The Ultimate ""What If"" Game","<p dir=""ltr"">At the beginning of 2025, I fully believed I had grown tired of stories about multiple timelines. During the past decade, the Marvel Cinematic Universe pushed the classic comic book narrative device into the mainstream, fueling a film conglomerate with legally approved cameos, flashy visuals on the silver screen, and loose plots that, eventually, came together for one final pay-off.</p><p dir=""ltr"">While the concept of the multiverse has been explored in film and TV even before Marvel's takeover, it quickly became the narrative foundation of choice. When done right, the potential is undeniable--works like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and Everything, Everywhere, All at Once are heartwrenching displays of interpersonal relationships, making characters face the reality of what-if scenarios, reconciling with their choices and what could have been if they had turned the other way instead. But you can only hear the same tune so many times before it starts to lose its original impact.</p><p dir=""ltr"">It wasn't until The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy that my interest was reanimated. The visual novel and strategy-RPG hybrid presents itself as deceivingly linear, only to push you into a completely different story structure at the very end. It makes for a sprawling web of outcomes based on your choices, all while showcasing different perspectives on events and characters that weave absurdity and sentimentality in equal measure in a showcase of creative prowess from the development team.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-is-the-ultimate-what-if-game/1100-6537033/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-03T12:19:15.735822

Best Of 2025: Avowed's Most Controversial Feature Is Also One Of Its Best,"<p dir=""ltr"">Obsidian's <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/"">Avowed</a> is one of the better action-RPGs released in 2025. While it doesn't reinvent any particular wheel, it benefits from an engaging campaign, fun combat systems, and charming characters. Aside from the occasional bug--a common element of Obsidian's open-world games--and an overabundance of homicidal bears, I liked nearly everything about the game. That includes Avowed's most controversial game mechanic: enemy respawns, or the lack thereof.</p><p dir=""ltr"">When it comes to RPGs, players often think of a few key elements. Some sort of leveling system, quest-granting NPCs, obtainable loot that bolsters certain ""builds"" or playstyles--you know, the basics. One feature that's common but maybe not as notable, considering its use in other genres, is respawning enemies. Players often expect areas to repopulate with baddies whenever they return to a given location. Avowed isn't about that life though--at least, not entirely.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Avowed is designed to respond to your actions in meaningful ways, and not just during key moments, where certain decisions can change the direction of the game's story. This also applies to Avowed's enemies. Essentially, most of the outlaws, walking mushrooms, and crazed bears you'll run into during your journey, won't return after being killed. Laid waste to a group of Xaurips while wandering through the forest? Don't worry. They'll still be dead on return trips. Slain a few dozen Spiderlings in an underground lair? They won't be resurrected anytime soon, either. Rinse and repeat--or rather, don't repeat.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-of-2025-avoweds-most-controversial-feature-is-also-one-of-its-best/1100-6536983/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-03T12:19:15.735822

Skin Deep Is 2025's Best Cat Game,"<p dir=""ltr"">My favorite moment in Skin Deep, an immersive sim and stealth game about rescuing cats and fighting your evil clone in deep space, was always the one immediately after a thoroughly developed plan inevitably went sideways. The skittish way that I was forced to sprint and crawl under a table or into a vent. The manner in which my strategy devolved into simply batting things off of shelves in order to incapacitate a roaming guard or noisily distract them from looking in my direction. The way that I leapt onto a guard's back, dug my claws in, and careened them into surfaces in order to knock them out. If you were to close your eyes, I'd argue you could almost hear that distinctive, feline yowl mid-action.</p><p dir=""ltr"">In short, I think Skin Deep best captures the experience of being a cat, even if Nina Pasadena, the game's protagonist, is decidedly not one. And for this tremendous feat, I am rewarding it with the honor of being the best cat game of 2025. Long live Skin Deep.</p><p dir=""ltr"">In a typical Skin Deep mission, I often tried to keep to the shadows, as is the norm for a game in its genre. I would relegate myself to the ventilation, the pipework surrounding it, and the undersides of tables. Like Batman, I skulked around the perimeter looking for a precise opening that'd enable me to punch a hole in the level's defenses while keeping my cover. Of course, in Skin Deep, it almost never worked out in my favor. Because I am not, in fact, Batman. I'm just a (cat) girl.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skin-deep-is-2025s-best-cat-game/1100-6536978/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-03T12:19:15.735822

"This Game With Rocket Trucks, Yakuza, And Sentient Mascots Is 2025's Most Radically Kind And Empathetic Game","<p dir=""ltr"">Throughout the events of Promise Mascot Agency, I was Pinky's ride. Anywhere that she needed to go, I had to ferry her in my crappy little truck. As a matter of fact, I was responsible for the transport of any and every mascot that stumbled through the doors of the Promise Mascot Agency and came under my employ. When Kofun needed to go to a nearby graveyard, I was the guy for the job. When Trororo needed a lift to the local adult store, I begrudgingly told him to hop in. Be it by land, air, or sea, it became my responsibility, and mine alone, to make sure everyone got where they needed to go.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Promise Mascot Agency is a game filled to the brim with chores and mundane tasks like this. As I traveled across the isle of Kaso-Machi, drifting in and out of decrepit villages and farm fields, I found that Promise Mascot Agency's cast was filled with folks in need of some assistance. The English teacher who worked unpaid overtime shifts to put on a night school at her underfunded workplace. The nearby mechanic with an insatiable curiosity for the occult, and no time between his job and family. If a shrine needed to be swept, I was there with a broom in a split second. Whether it was the local barkeep in a gimp suit, the streamer-turned-farmer, or of course, the disenfranchised youth, I was there with an olive branch to extend.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Promise Mascot Agency probably sounds like a convoluted game. It is. In one breath, it is a title about an ex-yakuza--handsomely voiced by the same actor behind Kiryu in the Yakuza games--driving around a countryside, rounding up seemingly endless collectibles and upgrades, and sending living mascots (like a giant crying tofu block) out on jobs via a simplistic management system and card-based minigame. In the latter, you must play support cards with differing strengths and weaknesses as a mascot performs a job in order to beat a troubling interference that arises and assure the job is a success. In another breath, it is a full-throated exercise in the lengths of compassion and empathy. It is rarely sleek and sexy about it--Promise Mascot Agency doesn't feature over-the-top set pieces or hide slick new super moves to reward the player for completing its long list of chores. But real, tender empathy for your fellow man rarely does look so good, and Promise Mascot Agency's unglamorous honesty is something I've come to admire from one of 2025's best and brightest games.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-game-with-rocket-trucks-yakuza-and-sentient-mascots-is-2025s-most-radically-kind-and-empathetic-game/1100-6536979/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-03T12:19:15.735822
Silent Hill F Has One of Horror's Most Gnarly And Profound Transformations,"<p dir=""ltr"">What do you think of when you think of a woman in pain? There are no tidy universalisms here, but for many of us, even most of us, pain is private and domestic. You could think of a mother shouldering burdens alone while her husband is at work. The father in the waiting room while the mother screams with strangers. A woman going to the doctor about an ache, only for him to tell her to lose weight and deny the problem is even happening.</p><p dir=""ltr"">All these things are simple clichés--tropes stolen from life and television. When Silent Hill f conjures a woman's private pain, it is with cutting specificity. In one of the most grisly moments of body horror in video games this year (or ever, really), protagonist Hinako turns into an emblem of her own sorrow, her own compliance, her own screaming rage.</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Spoilers follow.</strong></p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-has-one-of-horrors-most-gnarly-and-profound-transformations/1100-6537066/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-03T12:19:15.735822
How Love And Deepspace Became A Viral Phenomenon In 2025,"<p dir=""ltr"">In the cavernous convention halls of Gamescom 2025, conference attendees gawk at towering installations of fabricated castle sets and pirate ships. The massive movie set-esque booths inspire awe, but off center and to the side of these constructions rests another installation--one that has managed to draw an equally impressive crowd without a flashy monument. Wrapped around this booth are chattering fans--many who appear to be women and femmes in their 20s and 30s--all queued in a line long enough to wrap around a city block. They'll remain this way for the better part of an hour, a singular goal making this endeavor worth the wait: taking a photo with a cutout of their favorite man from Love and Deepspace.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Developed by Papergames, a China-based studio known for its work on the Nikki franchise, Love and Deepspace is a narrative-focused mobile game in which players romance and bond with a cast of five men. Since its release in January of 2024--and in the past year especially--Love and Deepspace has inspired a fervor comparable to those around the most beloved boy bands. It won Best Mobile Game Award at Gamescom 2025 and <a href=""https://www.pocketgamer.biz/anime-style-dating-sim-love-and-deepspace-surpasses-750m/"">surpassed $750 million</a> in gross player spending within two years of release.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Yet Love and Deepspace is more than any individual statistic or accolade. It is an absolute phenomenon--one that has also inspired a fandom characterized not just by its sheer size, but by the dedication of its fans. If you have been curious about the game,or rather what makes it so special, here is everything you need to know about the viral sensation, Love and Deepspace.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-love-and-deepspace-became-a-viral-phenomenon-in-2025/1100-6537076/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-03T12:19:15.735822
Fortnite Got A Lot Messier This Year,"<p>Epic has spent the past few years trying as hard as it can to will the Fortnite metaverse into being--and now, at the end of 2025, it's actually starting to look like it's getting there. Things are still very messy, but Epic's moves in that direction--which frequently seem to involve trying random things just to see what happens--may have finally borne fruit.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Back at the end of 2023, Fortnite attempted to usher in its metaverse in earnest by launching Fortnite Festival, Rocket Racing, and Lego Fortnite all at once. It didn't quite work, because all three were half-baked and missing key features. The only way to play Racing was in Ranked, Festival lacked instrument support and still doesn't have a practice mode, and Lego Fortnite had the feel of a generic early-access survival game wearing Lego clothing.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Two years later, we've got a much prettier picture, but not because Epic went all in on those modes. Instead, Epic has simply kept churning out new modes, some of which have done consistently. Likewise, Fortnite Creative has produced its first blockbuster map with any staying power. Thanks to some key legal victories, Fortnite is once again available on mobile devices in most places, which has dramatically increased the game's potential footprint. And the new cosmetic types added in the past year have proven a lot more popular than the cars and musical instruments that were introduced in Chapter 5.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-got-a-lot-messier-this-year/1100-6537064/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-03T12:19:15.735822
DK Bananza's Chaotic Design Sets It Apart From Mario,"<p>Drop into the lagoon in <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-a-new-start-for-nintendos-first-star/1900-6418382/"">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. Sure, you need to chase Void Kong to the Earth's center to save the day, but maybe you just want to soak in some water-adjacent locales as you explore this new world beneath the surface. There are plenty of secrets tucked away in each level's hidden crevices. When you first hop in there is really only one thing to do: pick a direction and start smashing.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Donkey Kong Bananza takes Nintendo's hallmark sandbox exploration and pushes it somewhere the studio rarely goes--pure chaos. Bananza is not interested in the kind of precision platforming that defines Mario's visits to Peach's Castle, <a href=""https://egmnow.com/super-mario-sunshine-is-nintendo-at-its-most-nintendo/"">Delfino Plaza</a>, or outer space. It captures that same cheerful vibe, but lets players rip through it.</p><p dir=""ltr"">There is a long-running design idea at Nintendo that movement should feel good on its own. Shigeru Miyamoto once said he wanted players to enjoy moving Mario around an empty room. The reason Mario is so fun to control in Super Mario 64 is that Miyamoto and the small team behind the N64 classic spent months making sure he felt great to play, even if the only action possible was running around an empty space.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dk-bananzas-chaotic-design-sets-it-apart-from-mario/1100-6537060/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-03T12:19:15.735822

That remains true over three years later with the Gen 2 model, which offers 40% better battery life--over 50 hours compared to 38 hours--and adds support for the Arctis Companion App.</p><p>The free iOS and Android app lets you adjust audio settings and switch between over 200 custom sound profiles designed for specific games. Along with these 2.4GHz Wireless profiles, there are a handful of Bluetooth profiles, including Bass Boost and Focus, that come in handy when using the Nova 7 to listen to music.</p><p>The original Nova 7 worked with the SteelSeries GG desktop app for PC and Mac, but the mobile app is easier to use and allows you to adjust audio settings on the go. The Arctis Companion App was introduced in 2024 alongside the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0DFRX1Z35?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">entry-level Nova 5 Wireless Headset</a>, and it only works with select SteelSeries audio gear.</p><p>If you own the first-generation Nova 7, upgrading probably might make sense if you take your headset with you during your daily commute or use it frequently for handheld gaming. But if Arctis Companion App integration isn't of interest to you, you'll want to stick with the original. But for everyone else, the Nova 7 Gen 2 is a terrific all-around gaming headset that remains my favorite in the $200 and under category.</p><p>SteelSeries designs the most comfortable gaming headsets on the market, and the Nova 7 is no exception. The adjustable elastic headband and lightweight, memory foam ear cushions are superb, and the sturdy steel frame holds up well. The custom 40mm neodymium audio drivers offer rich, high-fidelity sound; the audio is even more impressive and dynamic when using the custom presets created by SteelSeries. It has a retractable boom mic with AI noise reduction to block out ambient noise like keyboard and controller clicks.</p><p>Along with 2.4GHz Wireless with the included USB-C dongle, the Nova 7 supports Bluetooth and wired via a detachable 3.5mm audio cord. It also has simultaneous 2.4GHz and Bluetooth audio streams, so you can stay connected and hear sound from two devices at once.</p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&isPreview=1&asins=B0FRPH94LH,B0FRP6CMZ5,B0FRPVTQBB,B0FRNHBVFY,B0FRPF7BPK,B0FRP537FV,B0FRNR8Y11,B0FRNNXWNK,B0FRNPW7HS&tag=gamespot-promos-20"">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>   </div> </div><h2>Nova 7 vs. 7P vs. 7X</h2><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4628035-steelseriesnova7.png"" data-ref-id=""1300-4628035"" data-ratio=""0.5"" data-width=""1200"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 1200px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4628035-steelseriesnova7.png""><img alt=""SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 (Gen 2)"" src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4628035-steelseriesnova7.png"" srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4628035-steelseriesnova7.png 1200w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1595/15950357/4628035-steelseriesnova7.png 480w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"" data-width=""1200""></a><figcaption>SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 (Gen 2)</figcaption></figure><p>As mentioned, there are three versions of the Nova 7 Gen 2.

The only tangible difference between the three is the dial on the right earcup. The Nova 7X and 7 have a game chatmix dial, but since the PS5 doesn't have this feature, the Nova 7P has a Sidetone dial for mic monitoring.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steelseries-arctis-nova-7-gen-2-gaming-headset-on-sale-for-best-price-yet/1100-6537150/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-03T12:19:15.735822

The Tournament Edition, which launched in 1994, is essentially an updated and expanded version of the original NBA Jam. As the name suggests, the main addition was Tournament mode. It's still 2v2 basketball, but Midway added a third player to each team, allowing you to make substitutions throughout each game. The Tournament Edition also expanded player stat categories.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nba-jam-arcade1up-deluxe-home-arcade-cabinet-best-deal/1100-6537125/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-03T12:19:15.735822
"Games Want You To Play Forever, But Dispatch Tells You When To Stop","<p dir=""ltr"">Is there a more infamous monkey-paw wish than the collective dream that all our favorite games could last forever? Well, the finger curled, because it seems like all major game publishers in the world only want to make games that go on to infinity.</p><p dir=""ltr"">With the rise of live-service games, it's been a struggle to know when to put the controller down, especially when games like Fortnite release seasonal content like The Simpsons season pass that ask you to play long enough to unlock stupid sexy Flanders. Luckily, for us, episodic games, perfectly portioned into bite-sized morsels, have come back to rescue us from the endless grind.</p><p dir=""ltr"">In this case, I am talking specifically about Dispatch, the new episodic superhero game from AdHoc Studio. If the name is unfamiliar to you, AdHoc is a new game company founded by former members of Ubisoft, Night School, and perhaps most notably, Telltale Games, who blew up the episodic gaming scene with 2012's The Walking Dead. The studio would later close due to a variety of factors internal and external, some of which I covered previously as a reporter. But by then, the episodic-games formula was starting to feel a bit played out, and the mood appeared to be shifting towards either more complete single-player experiences, or the early live-service games we know today.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/games-want-you-to-play-forever-but-dispatch-tells-you-when-to-stop/1100-6537045/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-03T12:19:15.735822
"In The Switch 2's First Year, Every Third-Party Port Tells A Story About The System","<p>In November 2017, Bethesda Softworks and port specialists Panic Button performed what seemed like a miracle: They released a Switch port for id Software's recent reboot of Doom. The game, a famously fast-paced, intense shooter with modern graphics, seemed ill-suited to Nintendo's handheld and its capabilities, but despite some visual blurriness and a reduction in the frame rate, the game held up well on the hybrid system. In GameSpot's <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-switch-review/1900-6416805/"">8/10 review</a> of the Switch port, Peter Brown praised the game as ""an impressive port that begs you to consider gameplay over graphics.""</p><p dir=""ltr"">Doom was the first Switch ""impossible port,"" a colloquial term that players took to using whenever a third-party game designed for much more powerful hardware arrived on the Switch in pretty good shape. Over the course of the system's lifespan, it would receive many more so-called impossible ports, including versions of Wolfenstein 2: The New Collossus, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, The Witcher 3, No Man's Sky, and Ace Combat 7--large, visually-intensive, action-heavy games, all of them translated to the system with immaculate care. Seeing how the Switch handled these games was always exciting--even when the ports were less-than-ideal, there was still something special about seeing them run on a handheld from 2017.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Prior to the Switch 2's launch this year, Nintendo, in typical fashion, did not tell us much about what the Switch 2 was capable of on a technical level. We knew that the new 7.9-inch 1080p screen was capable of displaying gameplay at up to 120fps and was HDR-compliant. Nvidia announced that the system's custom chip would allow for DLSS, which is capable of upscaling games regardless of native resolution, and that the new system would be, of course, much more powerful than the old one. For early adopters, though, the system's first six-plus months of availability has involved a lot of curiosity over what the system can and can't do, speculating on what games the system could or couldn't handle, and pondering just how close these ports can come to other console versions.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-the-switch-2s-first-year-every-third-party-port-tells-a-story-about-the-system/1100-6536987/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-03T12:19:15.735822

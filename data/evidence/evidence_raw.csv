These New Lego Star Wars Smart Play Sets Mix Bricks With Tech,"<p>At CES 2026 this week, Lego introduced its brand-new Smart Play system--a series of high-tech Lego bricks, tiles, and minifigures equipped with sensors, accelerometers, light and sound sensors, a miniature speaker with an onboard synthesizer, and more. The company says these pieces can communicate to enhance interactivity. The system will launch in March with three Star Wars sets, available for preorder starting January 9.</p><p>While this isn't the first time Lego has experimented with electronic components, there are key differences with Smart Play pieces. For starters, they can detect nearby NFC-equipped smart tags. They're also wirelessly charged. This is a big improvement compared to the Lego Super Mario toys, which required AAA batteries to function.</p><p>All of the pieces work with standard Lego bricks. Each piece contains a custom-made chip that is smaller than a standard Lego stud. So what do they do exactly? Lego says the Smart Bricks will respond to actions with appropriate sounds and behaviors. Here's a closer look at what you can expect, starting with the new Lego Star Wars sets that will make use of this technology.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/these-new-lego-star-wars-smart-play-sets-mix-bricks-with-tech/1100-6537194/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-06T12:21:59.556951

Depending on the device, the headset can connect via 2.4GHz and/or Bluetooth.

You can also use it as wired headset with the detachable 3.5mm audio cable.</p><p>The 50mm titanium-plated drivers produce 24-bit/96kHz high-resolution audio. The headset supports 7.1 surround sound and is compatible with console-specific features such as the PS5's Tempest 3D Audio. For game chat, the Delta II has a detachable 10mm boom microphone.</p><p>The plush D-shaped earcups and headband are wrapped in leatherette and have memory foam cushions. The headset has a lightweight but sturdy frame and weighs only 318g (0.70lbs) overall.</p><p>The ROG Delta II offers incredible battery life of up to 110 hours over 2.4GHz and up to 140 hours with Bluetooth. Just keep in mind battery life drops to roughly 27 hours if the RGB lighting effects are active.

Someone Dressed Up As Pac-Man To Play Pac-Man During AGDQ Livestream,"<p>Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ), a bi-annual charity livestream, kicked off this week with an assortment of speedrunners playing new and old games, from <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/jet-set-radio-2000/"">Jet Set Radio</a> to <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers/"">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>. A wacky event that tends to attract all sorts of characters, someone made a surprise appearance during AGDQ on January 5: Pac-Man, who played <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/pac-man-world-2/"">Pac-Man World 2</a>.</p><p>Well, it wasn't really Pac-Man.

As the multi-hour livestream went on, the event's organizers booted up Pac-Man World 2 for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/"">Minecraft</a> content creator DThaiPome to play. If the event raised $10,000, then Pac-Man--really, DThaiPome in a blow-up Pac-Man costume--would speedrun his own game. That fundraising goal was easily crushed, and DThaiPome, in a Pac-Man outfit, played some Pac-Man.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wl0fD-h9mM"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2wl0fD-h9mM"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Playing a remastered version of the classic 2002 platformer, DThaiPome managed to beat Pac-Man World 2 in approximately 30 minutes, employing all kinds of skips and tricks to get to the end as quickly as possible.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/someone-dressed-up-as-pac-man-to-play-pac-man-during-agdq-livestream/1100-6537187/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-06T12:21:59.556951

Like the dreamcatchers quest in the game, players can shoot the webs and get them to release a feather.

Steam Smashes New Concurrent-User Record With More Than 41 Million Online,"<p>Steam hit a major milestone already this year, setting a new record for concurrent users. According to SteamDB, the platform peaked at <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/charts/"">41,816,052 users online at the same time</a> actively playing games. Not only that, but a new record for actively gaming users was also set, with that figure reaching <a href=""https://mein-mmo.de/en/steam-starts-in-2026-in-the-best-way-already-breaking-a-record-after-4-days,1544545/"">almost 13.4 million</a> as compared to March's 13.2 million record.</p><p>The timing of the record is likely no coincidence.<a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-steam-winter-sale-2025-game-deals/2900-7360/""> Steam's annual Winter Sale</a>, which wraps up later today, offered steep discounts on a wide range of popular titles, along with more modest deals on newer releases. Sales events have long been a reliable driver of traffic on Steam, pulling in both longtime users and players returning to pick up games they missed throughout the year.</p><p>Steam's growth has been steady for well over a decade, but it has accelerated sharply in recent years. A notable spike occurred in early 2020, when COVID-19 lockdowns pushed concurrent users past 23 million, later climbing to <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-passes-28-million-concurrent-users-setting-new-record/1100-6499464/"">28 million just a couple of years later</a>. The company even offered a bundle of games, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-covid-19-bundle-has-4-fantastic-indie-games-/1100-6475753/"">which went to COVID relief at the time</a>. Since then, the rise of live-service games and consistently strong seasonal sales have helped keep players logged in, especially during holidays.

Whether that be a curse word or an SOS, if you yell loud enough, someone will come to your rescue. At least that's what happened to one <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a> player, whose door was kicked in by a concerned neighbor after he heard the player yelling for help.</p><p>Redditor dreamthorp <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/ARC_Raiders/comments/1q35psm/neighbor_heard_me_yelling_help_in_arc_raiders/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"">posted a 16-second clip of the incident</a> on the Arc Raiders subreddit on January 3. They said they were playing a night raid on the Dam Battlegrounds, the game's very first map. While trying to extract from an elevator, a Leaper reportedly pounced on and downed them before the elevator doors shut. ""I just wanted to get stabilized so I could leave,"" dreamthorp said in the comments of their Reddit post. It's at this point that they started screaming, ""Somebody help me.""</p><p>Well, somebody did come to help. As displayed on the door's Ring camera, a concerned neighbor walked over, knocked, and asked if they were ""all good."" Dreamthorp screamed for help again, at which point the concerned neighbor--a firefighter, according to dreamthorp--stepped back, assumed a stance, and kicked the door in, an action that allegedly corrupted the Ring camera's file.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-player-screaming-for-help-gets-frantic-visit-from-real-life-neighbor/1100-6537173/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-06T12:21:59.556951
"It's The Final Countdown For Anthem, With Only One Week Left To Play","<p dir=""ltr"">Time is running out to play Anthem, BioWare's live-service game that originally launched in early 2019. In just one week, EA will take the online-multiplayer game offline, meaning it won't be playable starting January 12.</p><p dir=""ltr"">EA officially announced that <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-anthem-shutting-down-entirely-will-be-unplayable-starting-next-year/1100-6532956/"">Anthem would be shut down</a> in July 2025. This gave players roughly half-a-year to return to the RPG and to spend any leftover currency they had for the title. <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/anthems-end-is-nearly-here"">Eurogamer</a> is looking at whether any sort of in-game event is planned to make the occasion, but that seems very unlikely at this point.</p><p dir=""ltr"">After that announcement, former BioWare producer Mark Darrah <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bioware-producer-details-what-went-wrong-with-anthem/1100-6533735/"">discussed what went wrong with Anthem</a>--at least from his point of view. For instance, Darrah noted that Mass Effect director Casey Hudson pitched Anthem to EA as a whole new direction for BioWare, but then Hudson left the studio and couldn't lead that proposed transformation.

Code Vein II Tells A Time-Traveling Story That Will Tug On Your Heartstrings,"<p dir=""ltr"">The souls-like genre has exploded in popularity since the dawn of From Software's Souls franchise, with multiple companies taking a stab at the format--and some companies taking multiple stabs. Bandai Namco, who publishes FromSoft's Souls games as well as Elden Ring, dropped an anime-style version of the genre in 2019's Code Vein, and now it's back for more in Code Vein II.</p><p dir=""ltr"">We spent a few hours with the next Code Vein adventure during The Game Awards week, and we came away impressed with its improved combat system and a new and interesting take on the genre's ""summon"" mechanic, but what surprised us most was an original story that carries some emotional weight. The original Code Vein was a solid first effort, but Code Vein II shows that the franchise may have, pardon the pun, cracked the code.</p><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629230-pylon_exploration1.png"" data-ref-id=""1300-4629230"" data-ratio=""0.5625"" data-width=""3840"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 3840px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629230-pylon_exploration1.png""><img alt=""Code Vein II"" src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4629230-pylon_exploration1.png"" srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629230-pylon_exploration1.png 3840w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4629230-pylon_exploration1.png 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/37852/4629230-pylon_exploration1.png 480w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"" data-width=""1280""></a><figcaption>Code Vein II</figcaption></figure><h2 dir=""ltr"">A new code</h2><p dir=""ltr"">Code Vein II takes place in a world on the edge of ruin, and where humans and Revenants, a human-like species of beings with vampiric abilities, live amongst one another.

Would You Like To Play More Saw Video Games? Lionsgate Wants You To,"<p>Fans have had over 20 years of the Saw franchise, and John Wick is already celebrating over 10 years, with a fifth installment possibly on the way.

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Dev Doesn't Just Want To Be People-Pleaser With Next Game,"<p dir=""ltr"">To say Sandfall Interactive has gained a few fans after releasing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 would be a wild understatement.

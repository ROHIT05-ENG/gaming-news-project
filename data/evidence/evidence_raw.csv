"""What is a fair end-of-life cycle for a game?"" As Anthem servers are switched off, GOG weighs the ""complicated riddle"" of multiplayer game preservation","<img src=""https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/gog-anthem.jpg?width=690&quality=85&format=jpg&auto=webp"" /> <p>Polish digital game-shop GOG has built a business out of restoring classic games - those built for a different era of computers that have been rendered no longer playable. It has been finding a way to bring old classics back since it began operating 17 years ago. But in that time things have changed. New games released during that period became modern classics in their own right and found their way onto GOG, and the company's remit slightly widened. And as time marches forward again, a new challenge in game preservation has emerged - the question of how we save or resurrect fallen multiplayer games.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-weighs-complicated-riddle-of-multiplayer-game-preservation"">Read more</a></p>",2026-01-22T12:24:47.227657

What would the great Russian novel look like as a video game? If Dostoyevsky or Gogol had lived to dabble in Unity, what would be the result? The answer might well be Pathologic 3; or, to be more precise, the series of Pathologic games, since their daunting individual thematic and narrative complexity is in part a consequence of how they stand in relation to one another.

Battlefield 6 Devs Reportedly Betting Big On Season 2 Comeback Following Declining Numbers,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/"">Battlefield 6</a> launched on top of the world back in October 2025, peaking on Steam at more than 747,000 players, but the months since then have been a little unkind to the game.

The sentiment suggests that the team is well aware of the pressure to recapture even a fraction of the the audience that it landed right out of the gate.</p><p>Fans of Battlefield 6 quickly blew through all of its maps, modes, and battle pass at launch before subsequently voicing their frustrations with the game's technical problems and content. In particular, players have seemed constantly vexed at the game's lack of map variety, both in terms of sheer numbers and structural differences--many have voiced a desire for bigger maps.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-reportedly-betting-big-on-season-2-comeback-following-declining-numbers/1100-6538222/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-18T01:08:32.860500

"Switch 2 Price Hike Could Happen, Nintendo President Warns--But Only If This Occurs","<p>Could the Switch 2 follow the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S platforms and get its own price hike in 2026? That's the belief of multiple experts, and Nintendo isn't ruling anything out.</p><p>During the <a href=""https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260204e.pdf"">company's latest earnings briefing</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said the ""recent rise in memory prices"" did not have much of an impact on the Switch 2's profitability for the latest quarter, and it's not expected to for the current one, but if the costs keep going up, Nintendo might pass that along to consumers in the form of a price hike. Or it might not. Nothing has been decided as of yet.</p><p>""If this rise in component prices lasts longer than expected and runs through the next fiscal year and beyond, it may put pressure on profitability,"" he said. ""If the situation deteriorates significantly, we will carefully assess market trends and respond. As for any future change in the price of Nintendo Switch 2 hardware, no decision has been made at this time. Any decision to change the price will be determined comprehensively, taking into consideration not only profitability, but also other factors like the platform's installed base, sales trends, and the market environment.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-hike-could-happen-nintendo-president-warns-but-only-if-this-occurs/1100-6538212/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-18T01:08:32.860500
Pikachu Is Basically A Ghost In Pokemon Pokopia,"<p>It's official: Pikachu is dead. Or at least that's how it looks, as <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-preorder-guide-switch-2/1100-6536691/"">Pokemon Pokopia</a> will introduce a new variant of Pikachu that has a ghostly shimmer to it. The first Pikachu variant in 25 years and designed by Game Freak--Pokemon Pokopia is co-developed by Koei Tecmo--this version of the electric rat is officially known as Peakychu.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=""https://www.famitsu.com/article/202602/66124"">Famitsu</a> (via <a href=""https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/pokemon-pokopias-new-pikachu-form-was-dubbed-unfortunate-pikachu-by-co-dev-koei-tecmo-but-it-comes-from-a-place-of-love-we-were-surprised-and-thrilled/"">GamesRadar</a>), Koei Tecmo chief director Takuto Edagawa said that Peakychu was given the nickname ""unfortunate Pikachu"" internally, reflecting its ethereal appearance. In the game, Peakychu is unusually pale, has a smaller tail when compared to fellow Pikachu, droopy ears, and emits a strange glow from her body. ""In particular, Pikachu (Peakychu)'s temporal and melancholy feel is impressive. Internally, we called it Unfortunate Pikachu,"" Edagawa said. Draw your own conclusions from that.</p><p>While Peakychu <em>probably </em>isn't dead, it certainly looks like you'll need to borrow a trap from the Ghostbusters to catch one. It's one of several new Pokemon variants being introduced in Pokemon Pokopia, with the list so far including a moss-covered Snorlax called Mosslax, a messy Smeargle called Smearguru, and Professor Tangrowth, a guide to the game's Ditto who has disguised itself as a human.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pikachu-is-basically-a-ghost-in-pokemon-pokopia/1100-6538214/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-18T01:08:32.860500
High On Life 2 Mocks Game Pass Players In A Very On-Brand Joke,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/high-on-life-2/"">High on Life 2</a> is now out, and if you're looking to play the sequel to the 2022 original, you've got a few options. Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, the Squanch Games-developed title is also a day-one release through Xbox Game Pass, making it relatively easy to download and play if you're a subscriber. High on Life 2's developers haven't missed an opportunity to poke fun at this partnership between Squanch Games and Microsoft, as in-game personal assistant Suit-O has a few choice words for anyone who opted to grab the sequel through a ""game service.""</p><p>""You paid for the game, you might as well play all of it. Or did you get it for free with some deal? One of those game services, huh? I bet you're playing it on one of those game services,"" Suit-O says at one point. ""That's money out of pockets, I'll have you know. I mean, yeah, they pay us a lot to put it on those things, like millions, sometimes. But still! Think about how much more money we'd make if everyone bought it too! We could make a third game or something else entirely! What if we made Half-Life 3?""</p><p>Of course, there are several factors to consider here. How much Squanch Games was paid to make High on Life 2 a day-one launch title for Game Pass isn't public knowledge, and in terms of consoles, there's a far larger market on PS5 <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-gaming-revenue-declines-as-console-sales-continue-to-slump/1100-6537749/"">when compared to Xbox Series X|S console owners</a> and <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-is-not-coming-to-ps5-or-switch-memberships-rise-to-34-million/1100-6521132/"">Game Pass subscribers</a>.

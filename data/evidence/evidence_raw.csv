"Blizzard Announces Next Diablo 4 Expansion, Two New Classes","<p>The end of Diablo 4's Age of Hatred saga is nigh. Blizzard has officially announced the game's second expansion, Lord of Hatred, is coming April 28, 2026. The expansion marks the end of Diablo 4's ongoing story, culminating in an epic battle against the MMO-ARPG's biggest antagonist: Mephisto.</p><p>Revealed as part of 2025's <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/"">The Game Awards</a>, Lord of Hatred sees players team up with an unlikely ally in an attempt to put an end to the Lord of Hatred's uprising. The expansion takes players to the fabled isles of Skovos, a region that was meant to appear in Diablo 3 before ultimately being cut, and serves as the former home of both Lilith and Inarius. In addition to finally taking us to these long-anticipated islands, Lord of Hatred also brings with it two new classes. While Blizzard has yet to reveal what one of these classes might be, the studio confirmed the fan-favorite Paladin is finally making their return. Those who preorder Diablo 4 Lord of Hatred will gain immediate access to the class, just in time for Season 11. Below are images offering a look at the Paladin, as well as some of its different builds. </p><figure data-embed-type=""gallery"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621493-paladin_zealot.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621494-paladin_judicator.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621495-paladin_disciple.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621496-paladin_juggernaut.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621497-dia_x2_basiliskmount_paladin_005.png"" data-ref-id=""1300-4621493,1300-4621494,1300-4621495,1300-4621496,1300-4621497"" data-resize-urls=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621493-paladin_zealot.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621494-paladin_judicator.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621495-paladin_disciple.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621496-paladin_juggernaut.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621497-dia_x2_basiliskmount_paladin_005.jpg""><div class=""image-gallery__label"">Gallery</div>   <div class=""image-gallery__list hide-scrollbar image-gallery__list--small"">       <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621493-paladin_zealot.png"">       <img src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621493-paladin_zealot.png"" alt=""Gallery image 1"" data-full-srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621493-paladin_zealot.png 1421w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4621493-paladin_zealot.png 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1639/16394322/4621493-paladin_zealot.png 480w"" />     </a>       <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621494-paladin_judicator.png"">       <img src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621494-paladin_judicator.png"" alt=""Gallery image 2"" data-full-srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621494-paladin_judicator.png 1311w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4621494-paladin_judicator.png 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1639/16394322/4621494-paladin_judicator.png 480w"" />     </a>       <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621495-paladin_disciple.png"">       <img src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621495-paladin_disciple.png"" alt=""Gallery image 3"" data-full-srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621495-paladin_disciple.png 1381w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4621495-paladin_disciple.png 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1639/16394322/4621495-paladin_disciple.png 480w"" />     </a>       <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621496-paladin_juggernaut.png"">       <img src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621496-paladin_juggernaut.png"" alt=""Gallery image 4"" data-full-srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621496-paladin_juggernaut.png 1603w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4621496-paladin_juggernaut.png 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1639/16394322/4621496-paladin_juggernaut.png 480w"" />     </a>       <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621497-dia_x2_basiliskmount_paladin_005.png"">       <img src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621497-dia_x2_basiliskmount_paladin_005.jpg"" alt=""Gallery image 5"" data-full-srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621497-dia_x2_basiliskmount_paladin_005.png 3840w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4621497-dia_x2_basiliskmount_paladin_005.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1639/16394322/4621497-dia_x2_basiliskmount_paladin_005.jpg 480w"" />     </a>   </div>  </figure><p>""The Paladin rises as the realm darkens, wielding hammer, shield, and Holy Light to smite Mephisto’s demon army with righteous fury,"" Blizzard wrote in its press release.

"First Street Fighter Movie Footage Looks Bright And Colorful, And Then They Beat Up A Car","<p>The very first trailer for the upcoming live-action Street Fighter movie was shown at <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/"">The Game Awards</a>, which gives us our first proper look at the roster in action. And honestly? It kinda rules.</p><p>The film, directed by Eric Andre Show and Twisted Metal alum Kitao Sakurai, appears to be far more colorful, stylized, and dialed into the wild side of this series than anyone expected. Suddenly, that wild, eclectic cast, which includes the likes of Cody Rhodes as Guile, Roman Reigns as Akuma, and David Dastmalchian as M. Bison, doesn't seem as out-of-pocket as it sounded on paper. Everyone just looks right, and the colors flying all around the place wouldn't feel out of place as a cutscene in Street Fighter 6.</p><p>You can check it out yourself below.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-street-fighter-movie-footage-looks-bright-colorful-and-then-they-beat-up-a-car/1100-6536912/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-12T03:49:50.807241

The Nintendo Switch 2 version has been delayed, coming out sometime later in 2026.</p><p>The new trailer also showcases not only more of the caped crusader in all of his Lego glory, but a glimpse at some of the other heroes lending him their talents, like Catwoman, Robin, Batgirl, and Nightwing. These characters also have special abilities based on their skills, such as Catwoman calling in a cat to take out a goon.

Street Fighter Movie Cast Revives Mortal Kombat Rivalry For No Real Reason,"<p>Like any awards show, there's bound to be a moment or two that leaves you perplexed about what's going on. The Game Awards had one such moment just like this, and it came during the reveal trailer for the upcoming Street Fighter film, which was quite chaotic and loud.</p><p>Moments after Geoff Keighley introduced the Street Fighter trailer, the film's main cast took to the stage. Andrew Koji (Ryu), Andrew Schulz (Dan Hibiki), Callina Liang (Chun-Li), Cody Rhodes (Guile), David Dastmalchian (M. Bison), Jason Momoa (Blanka), Mel Jarnson (Cammy), Noah Centineo (Ken Masters), Olivier Richters (Zangief), Orville Peck (Vega), Rayna Vallandingham (Juli), Roman Reigns (Akuma), and Vidyut Jammwal (Dhalsim) all took the stage to yap about ... nothing much, really.</p><p>That's not entirely true, sort of. Liang confirmed that the cast wrapped up filming Street Fighter ""a few weeks ago."" Momoa--with a slight sway and a slight slur--cheekily argued with Koji over the pronunciation of ""Ryu."" Koji said the cast was there to present the Best Ongoing Game Award (which Hello Games' <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/no-mans-sky/"">No Man's Sky</a> won). Schulz really sought applause by asking the audience to ""make some noise"" if they ever played the game in their life. Schulz, for some reason, then reignited the longstanding rivalry between Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter by inviting ""the whole cast of Mortal Kombat 2"" onto the stage (which didn't happen).</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/street-fighter-movie-cast-revives-mortal-kombat-rivalry-for-no-real-reason/1100-6536913/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-12T03:49:50.807241
"Gang Of Dragon Is The New, Totally Not Yakuza Game From Ex-Yakuza Devs' New Studio","<p>Gang of Dragon, a new game from former Yakuza/Like A Dragon visionary Toshihiro Nagoshi, made its world premiere at <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/"">The Game Awards</a>, and it looks extremely similar to the Sega's own gangster franchise.</p><p>The debut trailer shows a back-alley stabbing, a showdown in a bar, and plenty of action, with what appears to be South Korean actor Ma Dong-seok in the starring role. It all looked very reminiscent of the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/yakuza/"">Yakuza</a>/<a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/like-a-dragon-ishin/"">Like A Dragon</a> franchise (and even has dragon in its own name).

He served as director of Yakuza/Like A Dragon studio Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios for a number of years before departing Sega in 2021. He then formed Nagoshi Studio in 2022, under the umbrella of Chinese publisher NetEase.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gang-of-dragon-is-the-new-totally-not-yakuza-game-from-ex-yakuza-devs-new-studio/1100-6536911/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-12T03:49:50.807241
"Control Resonant Debuts At The Game Awards, And It Stars A New Playable Character","<p>At <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/"">The Game Awards</a>, Remedy shared more details on its upcoming Control sequel. The game is called Control Resonant, and it's set for release in 2026.</p><p>In this sequel, both the genre and playable character are different than they were when 2019's Control introduced this branch of the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-alan-wake-2-reveals-about-the-remedy-connected-universe/2900-4952/"">Remedy Connected Universe</a>. As you can see in the reveal trailer, there's an emphasis on melee combat rather than gunplay like many of Remedy's past games. Also, players won't be playing as Jesse Faden again, but instead take control of her brother, Dylan, who was introduced in the previous game and has so far had a... let's call it ""strained"" relationship with his sister. Previously held captive by the Federal Bureau of Control, the bureau has now let Dylan loose as their special weapon in a time of grave danger.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhQm-ExRz60"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WhQm-ExRz60"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Though the game isn't set in a fully open-world environment, Remedy describes the sequel as an action-RPG placed in Manhattan, which acts as an ""expansive, reality-warping playground of choice."" Additionally, Remedy continues to flesh out its connected story universe, but creative director Mikael Kasurinen said that newcomers need not feel left behind, reflecting an approach the team previously took with Alan Wake 2 and FBC: Firebreak. Control Resonant, Kasurinen believes, will be ""easy to pick up and hard to put down.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-resonant-debuts-at-the-game-awards-and-it-stars-a-new-playable-character/1100-6536877/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-12T03:49:50.807241

New Game From Left 4 Dead Designer Gives Off Edge Of Tomorrow Vibes,"<p>Last week's announcement about <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-four-player-co-op-shooter-from-left-4-dead-creator-coming-to-ps5-and-pc/1100-6536695/"">the collaboration between J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot Games</a> and Left 4 Dead designer Mike Booth was sparse on details. However, the first official look at 4: Loop debuted at <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/"">The Game Awards</a>. In the trailer below, this co-op game leaves players hopelessly outmatched against alien invaders. The one advantage that the humans have is that they can die over and over again like Tom Cruise in Edge of Tomorrow, and awaken in 3D-printed bodies with the knowledge they need to succeed.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-5ieEtmgTc"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6-5ieEtmgTc"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>The trailer reveals that Earth was conquered in minutes, and most of the human population was frozen in place by some kind of crystalline structure. The scientist narrating the trailer takes the blame for what happened, and also the credit for the potential solution. By using the scientist's 3D-flesh printer, players are effectively immune from permanent death. The game doesn't appear to have an actual time loop when players die, but the knowledge players gain carries over to the next attempt.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=""https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/announcing-4loop-a-new-four-player-co-op-shooter-from-sie-and-bad-robot-games/"">PlayStation Blog</a>, Booth revealed that 4:Loop is a significant step forward from Left 4 Dead. Players can actually pick up their fallen comrades and carry them to safety.

Kennedy will indeed make an appearance in the game.</p><p>Sony spoiled the surprise earlier this week, as new key art featuring Grace Ashcroft--the daughter of Resident Evil Outbreak's Alyssa Ashcroft--also included longtime Resident Evil star Leon and his classic '90s hairstyle.</p><p>The new trailer gives off serious Se7en vibes, starting with a wrinkly guy in goggles menacing Grace, before we get our first look at an older, more grizzled badass Leon Kennedy wielding an axe. We find him first checking out crime scenes, before he winds up doing some wetwork against an entire doctor's office with a chainsaw and meeting up with Grace.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leon-kennedy-is-back-in-resident-evil-requiem-and-now-he-has-a-chainsaw/1100-6536786/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-12T03:49:50.807241
The Game Awards Officially Confirms What Mysterious Monolith Was Teasing,"<p>The mystery of the monolith has been solved, in a <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-reveals-its-biggest-game-ever-divinity/1100-6536878/"">reveal at The Game Awards</a> that involved real-life actors and one of the goriest, most graphic trailers of the show. As hinted by a mysterious handful of trademark filings, the statue is promoting a new Divinity game from Larian, which appears to just be titled Divinity.</p><p>Geoff Keighley also revealed that the statue itself, which made an appearance at the end of the trailer, is called the Hellstone. No doubt it will play a part in the upcoming game, which Keighley said would be Larian's biggest ever.</p><p>Larian's publishing director, Michael Douse, took to X after the reveal to share some more information on the monolith itself, and why Larian decided to use the physical statue to announce its new game. ""We're all increasingly divorced from physicality, so we wanted to build a monument for not only our international teams to gather around, but for the rest of the gaming community to rally around,"" Douse explained. ""We wanted people to get excited for the next big game on their list, and we wanted to do it in a way that employed skill and craft, by hand, to drive people outside to see it, and to talk about it.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-mystery-of-the-game-awards-monolith-appears-to-have-been-spoiled-by-a-trademark-filing/1100-6536822/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-12T03:49:50.807241

Debut Title From Last of Us And Uncharted Co-Director Revealed,"<p>One of the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/"">big reveals</a> at <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/"">The Game Awards</a> today was the debut game from Bruce Straley's Wildflower Interactive, called Coven of the Chicken Foot. A single-player adventure about an elderly witch named Gertie and a peculiar creature, the game sees the two build a bond as they learn to work together to fulfill an oath. The big draw is the creature's technology, which will react dynamically to your actions, observing how you play and evolving its abilities to assist you.</p><p>Set in a stylized fantasy world where all the dungeons have been plundered, monsters have been slain, and heroes have moved on, Coven of the Chicken Foot will see players venture into deadly dungeons and dangerous forests. Gertie doesn't swing a sword to stay out of danger, but the creature can adapt to assist her. Wildflower Interactive says that Coven of the Chicken Foot will be a wordless game, as the story will be pieced together by paying attention to your environment and the small choices you make along the way.</p><p>Wildflower Interactive was formed in 2021 by Bruce Straley. The veteran game director and artist cut his teeth working on titles like X-Men and Gex: Enter the Gecko in the '90s, and after a stint at Crystal Dynamics, he joined Naughty Dog in 1999. Straley worked on several of the studio's big games during the 2000s, and he served as game director on blockbusters like Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, The Last of Us, and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/debut-title-from-last-of-us-and-uncharted-co-director-revealed/1100-6536829/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-12T03:49:50.807241
Next Star Wars RPG Returns To The Old Republic,"<p>Announced via a cinematic trailer during <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/"">The Game Awards 2025</a>, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic/"">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a> is an upcoming single-player RPG. We know next to nothing about the game save for the time period it's taking place in--the same as the original Knights of the Old Republic games--but it certainly looks cool.</p><p>Fate is being developed by Arcanaut Studios with a team being helmed by Casey Hudson (yes, the same guy who was the game director of the first <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/"">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a> and then later, the first three Mass Effect games). The game is being described as a spiritual successor to the original KOTOR games, but it's unclear if that means it will reboot part of the story or simply be the sequel we never got. Only time will tell.</p><p>""Working on Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was one of the defining experiences of my career,"" Hudson said in a press release. ""With Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, we're telling a completely new and different story with everything we've learned since--crafting an adventure about choice, destiny, and the timeless struggle between light and dark. It's a dream come true to once again collaborate with Lucasfilm Games.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-star-wars-rpg-returns-to-the-old-republic/1100-6536905/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-12T03:49:50.807241

Move over, Mario and Donkey Kong, because there's a new jumpman in town ... or the woods--wherever badgers live.</p><p>Bradley the Badger is an upcoming action-adventure platform that, <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/4198090/Bradley_the_Badger/"">according to its Steam Store page</a>, is a ""love letter to games."" More specifically, the game is this hodgepodge of game-development ideas and faux pas. There are unfinished game worlds you'll have to put back together, ""under review"" cathedrals you'll have to explore, and copious enemies to find as you do it all.</p><p>As the trailer continues, they are fascinating worlds with funny names: Badgerborne, Cyberbadger, The Last Badger, and the like, all based on tropey game concepts.

Nearly three years later, the movie is finally going forward with two screenwriters attached, David Leslie Johnston-McGoldrick and Alexandre Aja.

""Drawing from survival horror and psychological terror, their work establishes a world where fear is not just experienced, but earned. It is a cinematic blueprint designed to attract a director who can elevate that vision through performance and scale.""</p><p>As alluded to by Blum, the project doesn't currently have a director even though Aja has two decades of experience behind the camera. Aja previously wrote and directed Crawl, Piranha 3D, and the 2003 remake of The Hills Have Eyes. He is unavailable to direct Dead by Daylight due to his commitment to helm Under Paris 2 for Netflix.

All Skills In The Sims 4 And How To Improve Them,"<p dir=""ltr"">Just like with human beings, there are a lot of different things a Sim can be good at. These things are known as skills, and <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/"">The Sims 4</a> has amassed more than four dozen of them over the past decade, with new expansions and game packs gradually adding in new ones. At this point, the options are legion--there are more skills than most of us probably even remember. And each new expansion adds more of them--the new fairy-focused expansion, Enchanted by Nature, even added two surprisingly novel new skills for your Sims to train in. Even without adding more using <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-sims-4-mods/2900-5275/"">The Sims 4 mods</a>, we're practically drowning in skills these days.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Every skill in The Sims 4 has related activities that your Sims can do to improve that skill, but there are also things a Sim can do that will increase their gains in any skill. There are several aspiration rewards you can take that will make your sim gain skills faster--Night Owl and Morning Sim will increase your skill gains at night and in the morning, respectively, and Savant will give you a 25% boost to all skill gains permanently. Taking these perks is always recommended.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Likewise, there are skill books that will help you Sim learn a skill by reading about it. But your Sim won't max out any skills that way. Theory is good, but it can't beat actually doing it. So if you want your Sims to master a skill, they'll need to get their hands dirty.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-skills-in-the-sims-4-and-how-to-improve-them/1100-6531881/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-17T01:05:58.373666

How To Become Ruler In The Sims 4: Royalty And Legacy,"<p>The newest expansion for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/"">The Sims 4</a>, Royalty and Legacy, introduces some major new wrinkles to the way this digital world works. The main one is that your Sims can now become ruler of the city they live in and start a dynasty that can solidify the family's power for generations.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Since the Royalty and Legacy expansion is fueled by pretty much entirely new mechanics, it's not actually that obvious how to get started on the road to power.

Being a professional noble is very different from any other career in The Sims 4, because it's a 24/7 gig. Everything your Sim does can hypothetically affect their status. And this career isn't one you can join with a phone call. To start things off, you'll need to one of three options: request a knighthood from a noble who likes your Sim; choose the Research Nobility option on the book The Duchess Diaries: A History of Nobility, which is stocked on every bookshelf; or buy a throne in build mode and simply declare your Sim a noble.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-become-ruler-in-the-sims-4-royalty-and-legacy/1100-6538194/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-17T01:05:58.373666

The game features a retro, pixelated art style that only adds to its creepy vibes. It alone typically retails for $15--making the Love You To Death Bundle a much better deal than buying the game by itself.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/humble-love-you-to-death-bundle/1100-6538134/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-17T01:05:58.373666

Blizzard President Johanna Faries is very optimistic about the company's future, but she's also fully aware that not every swing at the plate will work out in its favor.</p><p>""We've set a lot in motion with respect to [the future of Blizzard], making sure we're clear on it, making sure we’re coordinated on it,"" said Faries during an appearance on the <a href=""https://youtu.be/A3SDlnpT5V4"">Official Xbox Podcast</a>. ""There's sort of a reliability that players can depend on us to launch in big ways, launch in surprising ways. Maybe take some zags! Not everything's going to hit. That's gaming. But in many ways, let's understand where we are going--not only as a company, but by franchise, by game.""</p><p>Faries may be referring to some Blizzard games that were in development but never saw the light of day.

In total, there are 80 additional new skill options and 40 reworked ones that will be coming to all Diablo 4 players. Lord of Hatred owners will have 20 additional skill choices to choose from.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-lord-of-hatred-is-completely-removing-passive-skills/1100-6538191/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-17T01:05:58.373666

Death Stranding 2 Concept Art Reveals Sam’s Lost Turtleneck Phase,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/"">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> isn't exactly subtle in its themes, as the story is clearly influenced by COVID, lockdowns, and travel restrictions in place during the early years of the coronavirus outbreak. Originally, game director Hideo Kojima had an entirely different story in mind, but after the COVID pandemic began in 2020, he began to rethink his approach to the topic of connection. So what did Death Stranding 2 originally look like? For starters, it would have involved a lot more high-end fashion for its protagonist, Sam Porter Bridges, and his allies.</p><p><a href=""https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2022205133405446574"">Kojima recently posted images online</a> from the upcoming <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-art-book-goes-behinds-the-scenes-on-death-stranding-2-on-the-beachs-development/1100-6532664/"">Death Stranding 2 art book</a>, showing off a ""pre-COVID"" look at Bridges and Fragile.

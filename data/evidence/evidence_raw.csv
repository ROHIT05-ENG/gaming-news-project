With the looming threat of the undying horde known as the Griegr drawing close, the duo works together to gather a trusty crew of friends and allies to help save the day. Proud Nordics is an enhanced version of Ys X, offering improved performance, rebalanced gameplay, and quality-of-life updates compared to the original game, which launched on PS4, PS5, Switch, and PC in 2024. There's also a brand-new story centering around Öland Island, and the devious time-trial dungeon Muspelheim. On top of all that, the game includes new Mana Actions, Mana Ride racing, and all DLC content from the original game.</p><p>As mentioned above, there are more JRPGs to look forward to throughout February. <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-preorder-guide/1100-6534719/"">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is out first on February 5</a>, and this is a complete remake of the original game from 2000. The new version features a gorgeous art style reminiscent of sculpted figurines and big changes to the story and gameplay aimed at making the game less of a slog to play. Preordering any version of Dragon Quest VII Reimagined gets you a special costume for the main hero and three Seed of Proficiency items. These preorder bonuses are included with all physical and digital preorders, while preordering the Digital Deluxe Edition on any platform gets you 48-hour early access to the full game starting February 3.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ys-x-proud-nordics-deluxe-edition-buying-guide/1100-6537790/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-03T01:06:37.515674

The steps are reproduced below:</p><ul><li>Update the game by verifying game files</li><li>Go to your game directory and delete the ""mods"" folder.</li><li>Go to ""Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\1118200"" and delete the folder.</li><li>Unsubscribe from mods that were updated/uploaded after January 30.</li><li>If you have any uploaded mods, check if they were recently updated without your consent.</li></ul><p>As explained by mestiez, the offending code was added through People Playground's workshop, which has now been temporarily disabled. According to mestiez's description, the mod removes the Contraptions folder as well as other PPG-related files.

This Resident Evil Requiem Live-Action Trailer Might Be Better Than Any Resident Evil Movie,"<p>The Resident Evil franchise has a mixed track record in the cinematic landscape, and a new live-action short film promoting Resident Evil Requiem may put all previous efforts to shame.</p><p>Titled ""Evil Has Always Had A Name,"" the roughly three-and-a-half-minute-long film features Maika Monroe, who starred in horror films It Follows and Longlegs.

The Differences Between All The Versions Of Half-Life 2 Will Surprise You,"<p>If you've ever wondered just how many differences exist between the (surprisingly) many different versions of <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/half-life-2/"">Half-Life 2</a> there are, then a new deep dive into each one offers some interesting answers.</p><p>Youtuber <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/@1Ocelot"">Ocelot</a> has gone through seven different versions of Half-Life 2, poring over each detail from the game's opening to Black Mesa East. The video starts by looking at the original PC build from 2004, which isn't the version you'll find on Steam today. That version, released in 2024 to commemorate the game's 20th anniversary, makes some significant visual enhancements to trick your brain into thinking Half-Life 2 has aged considerably better than you think. And while that's still true, it's remarkable to see how small, meaningful changes make a big impact.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlJxXMaRWBk"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"" data-video-start=""228"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jlJxXMaRWBk?start=228"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Curiously, it's also fascinating to see how much the current PC version has in common with the considerably older Xbox 360 and PS3 ports, down to peculiar bugs and visual oddities that exist across all three. Perhaps the most noticeable concerns the ominous opening with G-Man, and in particular the glow to his green eyes. This isn't present in the original or the 20th anniversary edition, and is subjectively better in its ""bugged"" state in <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-orange-box/"">The Orange Box</a> port.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-differences-between-all-the-versions-of-half-life-2-will-surprise-you/1100-6537837/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-03T01:06:37.515674
New MMORPG Ashes Of Creation In Turmoil Amid Staff Resignation And Layoff Warnings,"<p>Things appear to be in shambles at the California-based developer Intrepid Studios.

This Jet Fighter Game Is Being Built For Players Who Want To Show Off,"<p>It's a scientific fact that two of the coolest things in life are military fighter jets and the Devil May Cry franchise. So what happens when you smash the two together? You get <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/delivery-must-complete/"">Delivery Must Complete</a>, a ""high-speed Acelike Roguelike with SSStyle"" created by Australia-based developer Yoyoyollie. Revealed last year, Delivery Must Complete is what happens when a sidewinder missile locks onto the laws of physics and promptly blows it out of discussion, leaving behind a game where every fight is a spectacle and the sky truly is the limit.</p><p><a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639060/DELIVERY_MUST_COMPLETE/"">The Steam page explains</a> that you really will need to make a delivery via a fighter jet express courier service, but in the middle of an aerial warzone. Fortunately, blimps, dragons, and mechs are no match for an ace pilot who can tear across the sky, powerslide out of harm's way, and parry missiles. Every map is procedurally generated, with weather changes, varying cloud cover, terrain anomalies, and random map events that add variety to each zone.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo9MmJzQTLY"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Oo9MmJzQTLY"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Since revealing the project, Yoyoyollie has been joined by sound designer Jonathan Foe and Project Wingman composer Jose Pavli. Speaking to GameSpot, Yoyoyollie revealed that a wide range of influences had inspired the design of Delivery Must Complete--like Ace Combat, Project Wingman, Devil May Cry, Ultrakill, Afterburner, Sephiria, and Bomb Rush Cyberfunk. The game's cel-shaded look was born of Yoyoyollie's desire not to be bogged down by the time-consuming pursuit of realistic graphics, and because the cel-shaded design was refreshingly different.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-jet-fighter-game-is-being-built-for-players-who-want-to-show-off/1100-6537818/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-03T01:06:37.515674
Fallout Episode 7 Raised The Stakes For The Finale,"<p>Fallout Season 2's penultimate entry, Episode 7, puts all the chips are on the table.</p><p>While Lucy (Ella Purnell) is with Hank (Kyle Maclaclan) in the Vault-Tec executive bunker, The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) finally partied up with Maximus (Aaaron Moten) and Thaddeus (Johnny Pemberton) in the wake of the chaos at Area 51. Meanwhile, Norm (Moises Arias) discovered that Vault 33 is set to be used for an experiment involving the “Forced Evolutionary Virus” and Overseer Stephanie (Annabel O’Hagan) struggles with her authoritarian rule over Vault 32 while prepping for her wedding to the unwilling Chet (Dave Register). With the odds stacked against all of our main players, can someone take the jackpot, or does the house always win?</p><p>The episode opens up with a pre-war flashback on the Canadian border. Now a territory of the United States, two prisoners manage to escape an internment camp and run through the woods toward the border. The prisoners are revealed to be Stephanie and her mother, fighting for a better life than the one they have as prisoners in Canada. As they near the border, they’re stopped by a Marine in USMC Power Armor. Hope seems lost for a brief moment, until another prisoner appears, and turns out to be a suicide bomber--killing the Marine in the resulting blast. While Stephanie and her mother manage to get away, her mother is injured from the explosion and, as she dies, motivates Stephanie to make it to the border by any means needed, even if it means killing innocent people.

The most notable of these side stories is Cyberpunk Edgerunners, an exciting--yet painfully short--anime series that introduced fans to new characters and a reimagined vision of Night City. In a surprising twist, the anime was later adapted into a tabletop game called Cyberpunk Edgerunners: Combat Zone--which, yes, means it's a board game adaptation of an anime spin-off of a video game adaptation of a pen-and-paper tabletop RPG inspired by classic cyberpunk novels and anime. Cyberpunk Edgerunners: Combat Zone lets you relive pivotal moments from the show through its fast-paced combat encounters, and makes for a fast-paced way to play in the expansive Cyberpunk universe. If that piques your interest, you're in luck; it's <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Fight-Club-Combat-Board/dp/B0DFW5R8PM?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">on sale for $70 (was $100) at Amazon</a> for a limited time.

Cats are frequently introduced into conversation the same way a person might start talking about an intermittently beloved uncle who's just out of prison. Cats are often delightful reprobates and oddballs. They're needlessly, inventively cruel, or inhumanly calm and forbearing, or they're ostentatiously silly. One will sit on the landing and swipe at everyone. Another will hide under a bath mat, certain that they have attained complete invisibility.

His desire for power and notoriety is so distinct, in fact, that it has somehow summoned a supernatural 'crucible' from the darkest reaches of space-time, and this consuming chaos is so profound, it has managed to seep into four major eras of Japanese history.

"Fallout Actor Was ""Just As Surprised As Everyone Else"" By The Finale's Shocking Reveal","<p>Fallout season two recently wrapped and while the first season eased viewers into the dystopian wasteland created by Bethesda's video games, the show's second season dove deeper into the world in unexpected ways. From introducing the highly popular location of New Vegas, to bringing in popular factions such as Caesar’s Legion and the NCR and introducing some of the game’s strangest creatures, season two felt like an expansion in all the right ways. Yet this wasn't all Fallout season two accomplished; season two also laid the foundation for the franchise going forward by introducing a location new to the franchise: Colorado. Recently I was given the opportunity to travel to Las Vegas to sit down with the cast and crew to talk about this season’s biggest reveals and what’s next for Fallout in season three.</p><p>One of the most satisfying elements this season was getting status updates on factions such as the Legion and the NCR post-Fallout: New Vegas, which last saw them squaring off in a faction war known as The Battle for the Hoover Dam. The show sets up perhaps the largest faction war the franchise has ever seen, with all these forces marching onto the New Vegas strip for an all-out war. Showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet had this to say about what viewers can expect to see during the incoming conflict:</p><p>“It’s interesting that a lot of these factions have been sort of dormant. One thing we talk about as a show is our excitement to see new civilization start to blossom again. But whose version will flourish in Vegas now that the Deathclaws are gone? It’s a big question that we hope fans are as curious about as we are.”</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-actor-was-just-as-surprised-as-everyone-else-by-the-finales-shocking-reveal/1100-6538011/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-07T12:22:52.922777

"Pokemon Pinball Machines Announced, And They're Super-Expensive","<p>Stern Pinball has announced that an official Pokemon pinball table is on the way, but you'll need some deep pockets to buy one. While the company hasn't revealed what the table will look like, it has set a price for these expensive machines and a ""coming soon"" release window.</p><p><a href=""https://pokemon.sternpinball.com/"">According to Stern</a>, the Pro model will cost $6,999, the Premium table is priced at $9,699, and a limited-edition model is an eye-watering $12,999. Of these, only 750 are being made, and if it's anything like Stern's other ultra-limited pinball machines, it'll have some sort of gimmick to justify its price. For example, the company released a <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-13000-john-wick-pinball-table-comes-with-a-piece-of-his-suit/1100-6523199/"">$13,000 John Wick-themed pinball table</a> in 2024 that looked great, featured various interactive elements inspired by the movies, and included pieces of Wick’s iconic suits.</p><p>Could it be that Stern has cracked the genetic code of the animal kingdom and has bred real-life Pikachus to act as an eternal power source for this table? We'll have to wait and see.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-pinball-machines-announced-and-theyre-super-expensive/1100-6537992/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-07T12:22:52.922777
A Very Unexpected Remaster Calls Back To The Pre-Fortnite IP Onslaught,"<p dir=""ltr"">Remasters are inherently nostalgic, attempting to evoke a certain feel and mood again years after the original release. Few of them, however, symbolize a time capsule as much as Poker Night at the Inventory. The concept of sitting down characters from four different franchises at the same poker table was novel in 2010. Now, after the likes of Fortnite have fostered an ever-increasing IP onslaught, bringing back such an oddity of a crossover makes for a significant contrast.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Poker Night at the Inventory was born as a spiritual successor to Telltale Texas Hold'em. At the time, Telltale Games CEO Dan Conners said the concept grew out of an idea from employees who wondered what video game characters do when they're not ""on the clock."" This led to Telltale picking up stars from existing licensed series it had adapted as episodic games--Max from Sam &amp; Max and Strong Bad from Homestar Runner--and pitting them against Tycho from webcomic Penny Arcade and The Heavy from Valve's Team Fortress 2.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoXKhwb18MY"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RoXKhwb18MY"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir=""ltr"">Having characters from completely different backgrounds and series bantering with each other was the main selling point. Alongside the bizarre premise, the particular selection also converged PC and online culture fandoms that were quite vivid in the early 2010s. Considering this <a href=""https://youtu.be/MaIPdeHGqVI?si=sUrXuR_YGg4t6Mg6&amp;t=1"">13-year-old video compilation</a> of jokes and trash talk between the cast has accrued 2.3 million views, it's safe to assume there has been some lingering fondness over the years--especially considering the game was delisted in 2019.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-very-unexpected-remaster-calls-back-to-the-pre-fortnite-ip-onslaught/1100-6537991/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-07T12:22:52.922777

The Next-Gen Xbox Could Feature A Big Change From The Norm,"<p>The launch window for the next generation of consoles is still unknown, but when it happens, Epic Games plans to have its store on one of the major systems on ""day one."" According to Epic's Steve Allison, Microsoft has already conveyed that the Epic Games Store is welcome on the new Xbox console.</p><p>""We definitely plan to be on the new hardware for Xbox,"" Allison told <a href=""https://www.gamefile.news/p/epic-has-many-plans-for-its-game"">Game File</a>. ""Because, unless their policy or stance on it changes, they are telling us they're going to welcome that. And we're going be there, like, on day one. That will probably require us to build in whatever their requirements are, some sort of software to support that.""</p><p>If that goes forward, it could change the fundamental way that console players purchase digital games. PC gamers are able to use any digital marketplace, but Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have their own proprietary gaming outlets. It's been a closed ecosystem through the current console generation. Adding Epic Games Store to the next Xbox would essentially be inviting players to spend money at a rival to the Xbox store that would have otherwise gone to Microsoft. It could also lead to pricing wars, if games available on both storefronts are cheaper on the other outlet.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-will-feature-epic-games-store-on-day-one/1100-6537980/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-07T12:22:52.922777

The biggest new addition in this update is new Warden Ekon, who joins the eight Wardens already on Highguard's roster. Instead of riding a mount into battle, Ekon is a shapeshifter who turns into a powerful direwolf, boasting higher speed than any of the game's mounts in order to run down mounted enemies.</p><p>If you want to get wolfy without Ekon, Highguard has also added a brand-new wolf mount available for free to all players.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/highguard-gets-another-major-update-with-new-hero-new-map-ranked-mode-and-more/1100-6537978/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>Skydrift is added to the map rotation in 3v3 and 5v5.",2026-02-07T12:22:52.922777

When you're slain in battle, you'll drop your Guardian Spirit, which will also contain all of the Amrita and Soul Cores you've obtained since last visiting a shrine. If you die again, it's all lost for good. Knowing this, you'll need to safely return to your grave and claim your Guardian Spirit, or you may end up very disappointed to see all of that progress lost. Luckily, you can also use a Summoner's Candle to call your Guardian Spirit back with all of your Amrita and Soul Cores intact--if you have one.</p><p>Summoner's Candles are a rare resource that isn't to be used in every instance of death. Saving them for the right moments, though, can make a world of difference and keep you from losing potentially hours of your hard-earned progression. So, if you want more opportunities to rescue your Guardian Spirit without all the risk, here's how to get Summoner's Candles in Nioh 3.</p><h2>Where to get Summoner's Candles</h2><p>Summoner's Candles can be obtained in a few different ways, including looting, defeating foes, or buying them from specific merchants.

Baldur's Gate 3 Is Getting An HBO Series And At Least One Person At Larian Isn’t Happy,"<p>All those steamy campfire scenes are about to get a whole lot hotter; According to <a href=""https://deadline.com/2026/02/baldurs-gate-3-tv-show-craig-mazin-hbo-1236710583/"">Deadline</a>, Baldur's Gate 3 is getting an HBO series. The show will reportedly take place after the game's events and is set to further expand its already robust-story. The Last of Us writer and director Craig Mazin is on board to create, write, produce, and showrun in what will be his second time adapting a critically acclaimed and seemingly universally beloved video game for television.</p><p>Seemingly not attached to the series, however, is Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian.

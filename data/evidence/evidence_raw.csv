It has been finding a way to bring old classics back since it began operating 17 years ago. But in that time things have changed. New games released during that period became modern classics in their own right and found their way onto GOG, and the company's remit slightly widened. And as time marches forward again, a new challenge in game preservation has emerged - the question of how we save or resurrect fallen multiplayer games.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-weighs-complicated-riddle-of-multiplayer-game-preservation"">Read more</a></p>",2026-01-18T12:19:08.414613

What would the great Russian novel look like as a video game? If Dostoyevsky or Gogol had lived to dabble in Unity, what would be the result? The answer might well be Pathologic 3; or, to be more precise, the series of Pathologic games, since their daunting individual thematic and narrative complexity is in part a consequence of how they stand in relation to one another.

Some Of Monster Hunter Wilds' PC Issues Are Caused By Weird Glitch,"<p>Earlier this month, some <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/"">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> players reported that the game actually performed better on Steam when it has more DLC installed. Word about that improvement spread quickly among the Monster Hunter Wilds community, but the real reason for the game's improvement isn't about whether the game has DLC. Instead, the problem arises when Monster Hunter Wilds checks for DLC.</p><p><a href=""https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2026/01/the-latest-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-perf-drama-explained"">Digital Foundry</a> debunked the notion that more DLC was speeding up Monster Hunter Wilds. Instead, DF discovered that there's an automatic check for DLC that greatly impacts Wilds' performance. According to the report, when the option for DLC content was offered, the game itself ""checked for DLC thousands upon thousands of times, adding to the CPU load of an already over-burdened processor"" in less than a minute.</p><p>Essentially, this recurring issue in the hub area near a Support Desk Felynes has nothing to do with the DLC itself; it's happening because the game is constantly checking for DLC.

"Arc Raiders Will Get ""Multiple Maps"" This Year","<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a> was one of the big hits from 2025, and Embark isn't going to let that momentum wane in 2026. The studio has indicated that there are multiple new maps on the horizon, as well as an upcoming content roadmap.</p><p>""There are going to be multiple maps coming this year,"" said Arc Raiders design lead Virgil Watkins during an interview with <a href=""https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/there-are-going-to-be-multiple-maps-coming-this-year-arc-raiders-dev-teases-2026-roadmap-and-maybe-some-new-maps-even-grander-than-what-weve-got-now/"">GamesRadar</a>. ""And I think it's going to be across a spectrum of size to try to facilitate different types of gameplay. So you might see some that are smaller, and you might see some that are even grander than what we've got now.""</p><p>Watkins didn't share specific details about what will be featured in the new maps, but he added that ""the ambition is to try to pair it with some new type of experience, whether that's the map conditions or weather conditions we put in that make the play feel different, enemy types or compositions feeling different, or we're escalating the types of loot available there.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-will-get-multiple-maps-this-year/1100-6537467/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-18T12:19:08.414613
"Fallout Season 2 Viewership Numbers Are Way Down, But There Is An Obvious Reason Why","<p>The newest Nielsen ratings have arrived, showing a gigantic drop-off for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-episode-release-date-schedule/1100-6536675/"">Fallout Season 2</a> compared to Fallout Season 1.

Season 1 racked up 2.9 billion minutes of streaming time during its own opening week in April 2024. That's a 72% decrease, but the massive downturn was no doubt attributable to how the two seasons were released.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECI3eCAxRGw"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"" data-video-start=""14"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ECI3eCAxRGw?start=14"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Season 1, many may recall, was released in a binge format with all episodes arriving at the same time.

Hytale Guides Hub,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/hytale/"">Hytale</a> is the long-in-development <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/"">Minecraft</a> competitor from the team at Hypixel. What was once a very popular Minecraft server is now its own standalone experience that rivals Mojang's massive survival game in some ways, with plans to challenge it a lot more over time, no doubt. If you're jumping into Hytale to see what all the hype is about, you'll benefit from our guides on the game, which tackle the burning questions players may have as the game is now in early access.</p><h2>Starter guides</h2><p>The guides we have on Hytale for now all comfortably fit under one category: starter guides. This is because the game has only just launched and, by the studio's own admission, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hytale-console-version-planned-but-developers-want-to-focus-on-making-a-good-game-first/1100-6537393/"">there's plenty of work still to be done</a>.</p><p>For now, you can jump into Hytale and enjoy an experience much like the early hours of Minecraft.

All Armor Crafting Recipes In Hytale,"<p>There are few things more important in <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/hytale/"">Hytale</a> than the armor your character equips. Armor can save you from dying to a dangerous mob when you're exploring at night or in a dark cave. It also plays a large part in how your character looks, which does play a factor in your experience if you play in third person. While you might have already figured out how to craft the most basic armor in Hytale, there are several more advanced options that offer stronger protection from mobs.</p><p>The guide below shows you all of the current crafting recipes we have for armor in Hytale.

There Will Be Quite The Sideline Shuffle In Madden NFL 27,"<p> </p><p dir=""ltr"">When Madden NFL 27 arrives later this year, there will be nine new coaches roaming the sidelines for the 32 teams. Technically, a few of these won't necessarily be new altogether, as John Harbaugh goes from the Baltimore Ravens <a href=""https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/47616292/sources-john-harbaugh-giants-expected-barring-setbacks"">to New York Giants</a> after being fired from the former. But undoubtedly, there will be at least a handful of first-timers with the amount of vacancies--equating to over a third of all organizations.</p><p dir=""ltr"">EA Sports has incorporated features like Coach DNA and Coach Speak into the Madden NFL series, so your team's coach can affect your in-game experience. They also have their own playsheets, too. So, for fans of the Ravens or Pittsburgh Steelers (Mike Tomlin stepped away), they should expect notable differences with whomever their teams hire when Madden NFL 27 launches. Harbaugh and Tomlin were also two of the longest-tenured coaches in the NFL, starting in 2008 and '07, respectively.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-will-be-quite-the-sideline-shuffle-in-madden-nfl-27/1100-6537451/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-18T12:19:08.414613

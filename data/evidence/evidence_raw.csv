So, having completely overlooked Bandai Namco's anime-hued Soulslike Code Vein when it released back in 2019, its sequel was well off my radar. Until, that is, dark forces (Eurogamer editor-in-chief Tom Orry) conspired to nudge it into my orbit.

"Switch 2 Could Fail To Sell As Well As OG Switch, Says Analyst","<p>As <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-get-a-price-hike-this-year-expert-predicts/1100-6537500/"">one analyst predicts</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 will see a price increase this year, another analyst suggests that the Mario maker's Switch successor may not maintain the same sales figures as its predecessor.</p><p>IGN reported <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/did-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-have-a-bad-holiday-we-asked-analysts"">an in-depth story about the Switch 2's holiday season</a>, speaking to several analysts around the world to understand whether it really had a bad holiday. The short answer? Not really, as declining sales are expected for a console with a somewhat established base. The long answer? Kind of, particularly because the Switch 2 didn't have a big blockbuster exclusive to bolster sales going into the holiday season. <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond/"">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is good--<a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review-prime-but-not-quite-prime-prime/1900-6418446/"">as evidenced by GameSpot's 8/10 review</a>--but it's not a Mario or a Zelda, so the name cache wasn't there to elicit fervent purchasing during Thanksgiving and Christmas. Ampere Analysis' games industry analyst and researcher, Piers Harding-Rolls, told IGN that it's for this reason--alongside the predictable success of the Switch due to environmental conditions--that the Switch 2 wouldn't sell as well as the Switch did.</p><p>""When the original Switch launched, it followed a failing Wii U generation--there was a lot of interest, but hype and momentum built up in the run-up to the holiday sales at the end of 2017,"" Harding-Rolls said. ""This time around at the Switch 2 launch, demand was predictably high because of the success of the Switch. Following a record launch, it's not surprising that Switch 2 sales have not been able to maintain the same massive sales lead [as] the original Switch. For the record, Switch 2 shipments in 2025 should outperform the original Switch in 2017 and over a shorter period of time. Then there is the whole macroeconomic situation, less disposable income, and higher-priced hardware.

Capcom Explains How “Hot Uncle” Leon Came To Be In Resident Evil Requiem,"<p>With <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-requiem/"">Resident Evil Requiem</a> launching on February 27 for Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, developer Capcom is revealing more about the game. This includes showcasing series mainstay Leon S. Kennedy, who has become hotter as he's gotten older, and we can thank the company's female staff for that.</p><p>In <a href=""https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-leon-kennedy-became-a-hot-uncle-thanks-to-hawk-eyed-female-capcom-staff-who-reviewed-even-the-finest-wrinkles-on-his-neck-director/"">an interview with Automaton</a>, director Koshi Nakanishi discussed the ""ikeoji"" phenomenon that emerged after Leon was revealed during The Game Awards on December 11. (""Ikeoji"" roughly translates to ""an attractive or cool older man,"" typically in their late 30s to early 60s.) Nakanishi explained that it took quite a bit of time to perfect Leon's older appearance, with Capcom's female staff contributing a lot of fine details to make sure the zombie-killing badass was as hot as possible.</p><p>""We've spent quite a lot of time polishing Leon's visuals,"" Nakanishi said in a joint media interview. ""Leon has many fans among Capcom employees, and women in particular were pretty strict when reviewing his design. They would point out and comment on even the finest details like the wrinkles on his neck. When I mentioned that story in the past, a female fan told me, 'The women developers at Capcom did a really good job.' Throughout the development process, Leon was thoroughly refined, and I think we managed to come through with a design that would make anyone's heart throb.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-explains-how-hot-uncle-leon-came-to-be-in-resident-evil-requiem/1100-6537734/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-29T01:02:40.084088

Without the Smart Brick, you can still make use of two stud shooters and removable top panels that make it easy to access the detailed interior.</span></p><p> </p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://redirect.viglink.com?key=fbff19622bfc4d759c94ca50d964e98d&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fsmart-play-millennium-falcon-75426&cuid=--"">Preorder at Lego Store</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>                                                                     <div class=""js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container"">             <h2 class=""item-title"">                    <a href=""https://redirect.viglink.com?key=fbff19622bfc4d759c94ca50d964e98d&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fsmart-play-at-st-attack-on-endor-75424&cuid=--"">Lego Star Wars Smart Play: AT-ST Attack on Endor (347 pieces)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=""item-deck"">                      <a href=""https://redirect.viglink.com?key=fbff19622bfc4d759c94ca50d964e98d&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fsmart-play-at-st-attack-on-endor-75424&cuid=--"">$50 | Releases March 1</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=""image-container"">                                  <img class=""main-image"" src=https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1702/17023653/4642196-blt25801572ad058379-75424_boxpro%281%29.jpg>                             <a href=""https://redirect.viglink.com?key=fbff19622bfc4d759c94ca50d964e98d&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fsmart-play-at-st-attack-on-endor-75424&cuid=--""></a>                        </div>              <div class=""item-description""><p> </p><p><span>For a smaller project, the AT-ST is just 347 pieces.

That's equipped with a 7-inch OLED display, the ability to connect the device to a TV, and a 130Wh battery that manages anywhere between 90 minutes to three hours of gameplay depending on the game.</p><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large""

"The ""Survival Of Graphics Card Manufacturers"" Is On The Line, Says GPU Maker Zotac","<p>The ongoing crisis with RAM pricing and the associated knock-on effect it is having on numerous consumer electronics still has its worst days to come, according to GPU manufacturer Zotac.</p><p>In a message to its Korean customers, translated by X user <a href=""https://x.com/harukaze5719/status/2015970334873456952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2015970334873456952%7Ctwgr%5E7c5a734649bf517a397c280db3e52dfd5e92575f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tomshardware.com%2Fpc-components%2Fgpus%2Fzotac-warns-component-shortages-threaten-the-very-survival-of-gpu-manufacturers-and-distributors-message-to-korean-customers-suggests-that-the-worst-could-be-yet-to-come"">Harukaze5719 </a>and reported by <a href=""https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/zotac-warns-component-shortages-threaten-the-very-survival-of-gpu-manufacturers-and-distributors-message-to-korean-customers-suggests-that-the-worst-could-be-yet-to-come"">Tom's Hardware</a>, the company announced that it is suspending its 2% rewards program in the region in a bid to try to sustain GPU pricing for as long as it can, citing growing concerns with escalating prices as an existential threat to the industry as a whole. Citing the same concerns over current memory prices and the increasing costs of silicon, Zotac has warned its customers that stock for many current-generation GPUs might dry up for a long time, with no promise of it regulating in the near future.</p><p>Zotac is one of a few companies that predominantly manufactures graphics cards and hasn't diversified in other areas of gaming hardware.

Halo MMO Was Trying To Set Itself Apart In This Way,"<p>Years ago, Microsoft and developer Ensemble Studios were working on a Halo MMO project. The game never materialized, though, and now one of its developers, Rob Fermier, has shared some further insight into the game and what it was aspiring to be.</p><p>Fermier said part of the appeal of making a Halo MMO was that the developers personally enjoyed MMOs in general. ""I still play World of Warcraft to this day, from day one,"" Fermier told <a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/nearly-20-years-ago-the-makers-of-age-of-empires-tried-to-make-a-halo-mmo-and-then-the-studio-closed-i-still-feel-like-no-one-has-really-done-the-action-mmo-i-see-in-my-mind/"">PC Gamer</a>.

"Emberville Announced For PC, Blends Diablo-Style Action With Stardew Valley Vibes","<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/emberville/"">Emberville</a>, the spooky fusion of Stardew Valley-like farming and Diablo-flavored combat, has an official release date window for its Steam Early Access debut. Out in Q3 2026, the action-adventure RPG will give players an early taste of its atmospheric world and combat, and to celebrate, developer Cygnuss Cross uploaded a trailer that features the voice talents of the Witcher himself, Doug Cockle, and Alex Jordan, who voiced all 11 versions of Jan Dolski in last year's The Alters.</p><p>In development since 2023, Emberville is primarily focused on customization through its farming, gathering, and crafting gameplay mechanics. Similar to other cozy farming sims--but with a touch of sinister malevolence in the air--players can gather resources and improve the procedurally generated world around them by leveling up, learning skills, and unlocking blueprints.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPsCEHnjBJc"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hPsCEHnjBJc"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> </p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/emberville-announced-for-pc-blends-diablo-style-action-with-stardew-valley-vibes/1100-6537712/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-29T01:02:40.084088
Assassin's Creed Black Flag Remake Rumors Heat Up With Leaked New Merch,"<p>Assassin's Creed Black Flag took the inner conflict of the Templars to the high seas in the early 1700s during the golden age of piracy. Along with retaining the series' stealth and combat system, gameplay elements focused more on the ship-based exploration on an open-world map. It's long been rumored that <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rumored-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-has-a-really-silly-title-according-to-rating/1100-6536787/"">it's in line for a remake</a>, and a recently leaked statue could add fuel to that fire.</p><p>The unreleased statue features Black Flag protagonist Edward Kenway sitting on a treasure chest overflowing with gold coins, leaning back against his ship's wheel, brandishing a cutlass and a pistol. Above Kenway is a waving flag featuring the game's logo: the Assassin's Creed sigil with a skull in the center.</p><p>Numerous fans spotted the item pop up, including notorious Assassin's Creed leaker j0nathon, who quickly realized this was not a statue that had been publicly released already. Even weirder is how this statue was reportedly listed via the used clothing resale app Vinted.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-rumors-heat-up-with-leaked-new-merch/1100-6537732/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-29T01:02:40.084088
"PlayStation 6 Is Likely To Launch After 2028, Analyst Predicts","<p>The PlayStation 6 is a much-talked-about machine despite lacking an official announcement from Sony, and a report by an industry analyst suggests that we might not see this new console until after 2028, as Sony is looking to extend the PS5's lifespan.</p><p>A Japanese-language report from <a href=""https://www.sandstoneinsightsjapan.com/post/sony-group-6758%EF%BC%89%EF%BC%8D%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0%E9%83%A8%E9%96%80%E3%81%AE%E5%A5%BD%E8%AA%BF%E3%81%8C%E7%AC%AC3%E5%9B%9B%E5%8D%8A%E6%9C%9F%E3%82%92%E7%89%BD%E5%BC%95%E3%80%81%E4%BB%8A%E5%BE%8C%E3%81%95%E3%82%89%E3%81%AA%E3%82%8B%E4%B8%8A%E6%98%87%E4%BD%99%E5%9C%B0%E3%81%82%E3%82%8A"">MST International</a> senior analyst David Gibson (per <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/high-likelihood-ps6-will-launch-after-2028-according-to-new-analyst-forecast-as-sony-focuses-on-extending-ps5-lifecycle"">IGN</a>) looked into Sony's overall performance and potential future. According to Gibson, ""Sony expects the PS5 lifecycle to be longer than that of previous console generations"" and that there is a ""high likelihood that the PS6 launch will occur after 2028.""</p><p>Recent console cycles have lasted around seven years, with the PS3 launching in 2006 before the PS4's release in 2013; the latter then had the limelight until the PS5 launched near the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. This pattern led to assumptions and predictions that a PS6 would come to markets in 2027, but Gibson believes there are a few reasons not to expect it so soon.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-6-is-likely-to-launch-after-2028-analyst-predicts/1100-6537721/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-29T01:02:40.084088

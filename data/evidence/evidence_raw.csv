"Live-Service Games' Success Depends On Limiting ""Churn"" More Than Huge Launches, Analysts Say","<p>New research suggests that the biggest challenge facing live-service games today is not getting players in the door, but keeping them there. As the market becomes increasingly crowded, long-term success now depends far more on retention than on splashy launches or expensive marketing campaigns.</p><p>For players, this explains why so many online games feel like they are constantly asking for your attention. According to <a href=""https://www.ampereanalysis.com/insight/the-endless-game-problem-retention-not-acquisition-is-the-key-to-success-in-live-serv?utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-88I0hAogFdZORD0ksLpFbfAj8RnXMbs9thbIAaSqKIq-KPoKjc4BUHLH8vWztAiSYve4wgjdKQ8AA3OLq1IDxhmDKAQA&amp;_hsmi=400656900&amp;utm_content=400656900&amp;utm_source=hs_email"">Ampere Analysis</a>, a London-based market research firm, most live-service games like Fortnite, Roblox, and Apex Legends experience heavy churn, with large portions of their audience dropping off within months. That makes it difficult for even well-known franchises to sustain momentum if players do not feel compelled to return regularly. In that environment, attracting new players can be costly and inefficient if the game fails to hold interest beyond the early hours.</p><p>Instead, Ampere points to retention as the key driver of growth. Games that keep players engaged over time generate more value per player, rely less on paid advertising, and benefit from organic growth through friends and social platforms. Long-running hits like Fortnite and GTA Online demonstrate how consistent updates and evolving features can turn a game into a years-long habit rather than a short-term trend.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/live-service-games-success-depends-on-limiting-churn-more-than-huge-launches-analysts-say/1100-6537703/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-28T12:24:57.846822

"The Witness, 10 Years Later, Still Refuses To Explain Itself","<p dir=""ltr""><em>The Witness celebrated its 10-year anniversary on January 26, 2025. Below, we look back at its methodical approach of letting the player teach themselves.</em></p><p dir=""ltr"">When The Witness launched at the end of January 2016, it felt willfully out of step with the rest of the industry. Big-budget games were growing louder and more cinematic with the likes of Watch Dogs 2, Mafia III, and Uncharted 4. None of those titles held their players' hands to an unnecessary degree, but clear objective markers ensured players were almost always aware of their next task. Jonathan Blow’s puzzle game arrived and couldn't have felt more different.</p><p dir=""ltr"">There were no prompts, no text boxes, no explanations. You woke up on a serene island and were expected to quietly figure everything out on your own.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witness-10-years-later-still-refuses-to-explain-itself/1100-6537705/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-28T12:24:57.846822

Valve Hit With New Lawsuit Over Steam Commissions,"<p>Steam has been one of the dominant marketplaces for PC games for over two decades, but its parent company, Valve, is now facing a lawsuit that argues the commissions it charges publishers have given it a monopoly.</p><p>As reported by <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/video-game-giant-valve-facing-uk-lawsuit-over-pricing-commissions-2026-01-26/"">Reuters</a>, the case was originally filed in the United Kingdom in 2024, but it was only given approval to go forward by a tribunal earlier this week. The lawsuit is attempting to represent ""up to 14 million people"" in the UK who have purchased games or DLC through Steam since 2018.</p><p>The argument at the heart of the case alleges that Valve has kept publishers from selling their games more cheaply on other platforms by setting contractual conditions. Essentially, Steam users who buy a game on that platform can only purchase DLC or additional content through Valve. The lawsuit contends that this locks in consumers to Steam rather than giving them options to go elsewhere.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-hit-with-new-lawsuit-over-steam-commissions/1100-6537689/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-28T12:24:57.846822

Some RPGs, like Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster, use mouse controls, and even select retro titles on the Nintendo Switch Online service offer optional mouse support, like Mario Paint and Nobunaga's Ambition.

Court Ruling Involving Classic Game Could Have Wider Repercussions,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/runescape/"">Runescape</a> has been enjoying a resurgence of popularity, but a recent court ruling in the United Kingdom may have made it a landmark in the realm of video game property. Essentially, an appeals court has ruled that theft of in-game currency from RuneScape is also theft in the real world.</p><p>Per <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/uk-court-rules-stealing-runescape-gold-is-criminal-theft-in-case-that-could-have-wider-repercussions-for-the-video-game-industry"">IGN</a>, the ruling came in the case of Andrew Lakeman, an ex-Jagex developer who is accused of stealing 705 billion gold--or approximately $750,000 in real-world funds--from 68 RuneScape players. Lakeman is also alleged to have sold this in-game currency for Bitcoin.</p><p>The initial judge in Lakeman's case gave the defendant a favorable ruling by finding that the gold that was stolen had no actual value because the game can create an infinite amount. The Court of Appeal disagreed with the first judge's take and found that the in-game currency does have value, and that stealing it constitutes theft in the eyes of the law.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/court-ruling-involving-classic-game-could-have-wider-repercussions/1100-6537684/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-28T12:24:57.846822
"Arc Raiders Has New 3-Strike Permaban System For Cheaters, But Not Everyone's Happy","<p dir=""ltr"">Like most PvP games, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a> has suffered greatly from cheaters.

Arc Raiders A Prime Specimen Quest Guide,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a> sports quite a few quests that send you to Blue Gate, but most of them don't require you to break into a dangerous husk and make it back out alive.

So, feel free to come in with a free loadout if you feel safer doing so, though you'll need to at least kill an enemy or two to find some ARC Powercells before heading to one of the ARC Deforester spots we'll have marked on a map further down.</p><p>When you're ready to knock out the A Prime Specimen quest, follow the steps we've outlined below.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-a-prime-specimen-quest-guide/1100-6537683/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-28T12:24:57.846822

Wonder can opt to upgrade to the Switch 2 version for $20. This also means you can save a few bucks by purchasing the Switch 1 version at a discount, then upgrading to the Switch 2 Edition via the eShop. The original Switch version of the game is often available online for less than its standard $60 MSRP--for example, it's currently available for around $53 <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-Bros-TM-Wonder-Nintendo-Version/dp/B0C8VHZR14?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">at Amazon</a> via multiple third-party listings. Adding the $20 Switch 2 Edition upgrade comes to $73 total, and while that only saves you about $7 compared to the Switch 2 Edition's $80 launch price, it's nevertheless a viable way to get the game at a discount.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2-edition-preorder-guide/1100-6537682/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-28T12:24:57.846822

"GTA 6 Not Having A Physical Disc At Launch Wouldn't Be A Huge Deal, Analyst Says","<p>A high-profile gaming analyst has reacted to the rumor that <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/"">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> may not have a physical-disc option at launch this November. To be sure, this is an unconfirmed rumor for now, and Rockstar has not commented on the situation. In any event, Matt Piscatella of Circana shared a quick-hit take on the rumor on social media.</p><p>Without naming GTA 6 outright--but obviously referring to the hugely hyped game--<a href=""https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mddy6wr7rc2e"">Piscatella wrote</a>: ""I would say that the big game missing physical at launch would be an even bigger fart on the wind sales-wise than game key cards are now. But it really wouldn't be worth it. So, I won't say that.""</p><p>Piscatella is clearly being cheeky here, but the takeaway seems to be that bypassing a physical edition for GTA 6 at launch wouldn't mean much in terms of the game's initial sales.

"Tony Dalton Says Working On Intergalactic Is ""Like Nothing I've Ever Done In My Life""","<p>Actor Tony Dalton, known for his roles in Better Call Saul and in the MCU as Jack Duquesne, will appear in Naughty Dog's next game, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/"">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, and now he's shared some more insight into working on the game and with director Neil Druckmann.</p><p>Speaking with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r2xhAE3EyI&amp;t=371s"">Culture Wave Media</a>, Dalton said Druckmann enjoyed working with him on HBO's The Last of Us, where <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-show-introduces-a-member-of-the-miller-family-not-seen-before/1100-6531634/"">Dalton played Joel's father</a>.

"Geoff Keighley Says He Has No Financial Stake In Highguard: ""Absolutely Not""","<p>One theory circulating online about the newly launched free-to-play fantasy shooter Highguard is that Geoff Keighley--the host and organizer of The Game Awards where the game was first revealed--has some kind of personal financial stake in the game or its developer.</p><p>Keighley was asked straight-up recently if this was the case, and he <a href=""https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/2015906199527686220"">replied</a>, ""lol absolutely not.""</p><p>It's been <a href=""https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2012524369298239493"">reported from multiple sources </a>that Highguard studio Wildlight <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2026/01/17/highguard-did-not-pay-for-its-infamous-game-awards-finale-slot/"">did not have to pay a penny</a> to show the game at The Game Awards in December 2025.

Switch Online Leak Might Rule Out A Highly Requested GameCube Remaster,"<p>A page on Walmart's website apparently let slip that two unannounced GameCube titles are coming to the Nintendo Switch Online library of classic games.</p><p>Near the bottom of <a href=""https://www.walmart.com/brand/nintendo/10030719"">Walmart's Nintendo page</a> (as first spotted by <a href=""https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/rumour-switch-online-gamecube-releases-might-have-been-leaked"">Nintendo Life</a>), a graphic advertising the Nintendo Switch Online paid membership includes box art for several retro games that are already available on the Nintendo Classics apps. Metroid Prime 2 and Pikmin 2, which Nintendo has not announced for NSO as of yet, are included in the image, which is still on the Walmart site as of this writing.</p><p>Already on the <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/1qo3atw/metroid_prime_2_no_remaster/"">Metroid subreddit</a>, fans are lamenting that Prime 2 coming to Nintendo Classics appears to indicate that the 2004 title won't be <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yes-metroid-prime-2-and-3-are-reportedly-still-coming-to-switch/1100-6511589/"">getting a proper remaster</a>, as the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-remains-a-revelation/1100-6511575/"">first game did for the Switch in 2021</a>.

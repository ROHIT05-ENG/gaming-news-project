Clair Obscur Celebrates Its Game Awards Blowout With A Major New Update,"<p>It was almost a foregone conclusion, but Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 absolutely crushed it at <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/"">The Game Awards</a> this year, taking home little polygonal statues for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/"">a record-setting number of categories</a> it was nominated for. When the game's director, Guillaume Broche took the stage, he thanked <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/"">a number of individuals</a>, but he ended his speech by giving a very special thank you to us, the players, not with a speech, but with a rather sizable update for the game that dropped the second he walked on stage to accept the award.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WPmS4eSknc"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6WPmS4eSknc"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Dubbed ""The Thank You Update"", this is no mere costume/weapon set, though there's over a dozen each of those to go find too. This is an all-encompassing update that brings everything from quality-of-life updates--a Picto/Lumina filter, a long-overdue photo mode, and an option to escape from battles, to a completely new area called ""Verso's Drafts,"" with a bunch of new story content, mostly about Verso's childhood, and the final music tracks written by Lorien Testard for the game.</p><p>You can watch the trailer for it here, but, really, we're very sorry, this is a Jack from Lost situation now; you're gonna have to go back and play. The Thank You Update/patch 1.5.0 is available right now on all platforms.

The Game Awards 2025 Keeps The Legend Of Flute Guy Strong,"<p>Each year The Game Awards sees its fair share of viral moments both cringe and heartwarming, but none have persisted through the years quite so much as orchestra member Pedro Eustache--better known as ""Flute Guy.""

Former Titanfall Devs Trade In Mechs For Horses In New Fantasy Raid Shooter Highguard,"<p>As <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/"">The Game Awards 2025</a> came to a close, we got one more surprise: Wildlight--a team of devs led by folks who previously worked on <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/titanfall-2/"">Titanfall 2</a> and <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/"">Apex Legends</a>--announced its new game: <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/highguard/"">Highguard</a>. Not only that, the game will be playable in a few weeks.</p><p>A gameplay trailer showcased that Highguard leans into Apex Legends' hero shooter formula but takes it in a different direction, opting for an objective-based raid shooter as opposed to a kill-or-be-killed battle royale. The narrative direction of the game is different too, opting for something that looks more high fantasy (like horses, magic, and pet familiars) while still maintaining that science-fiction flair when it comes to the various characters' abilities and firearms.</p><p>On <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/"">Steam</a>, Highguard is described as a ""PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent. [Players will battle] rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-titanfall-devs-trade-in-mechs-for-horses-in-new-fantasy-raid-shooter-highguard/1100-6536921/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-12T13:47:16.367548

We then cut to some actual gameplay of our protagonist, the elite assassin Soul, as he travels around various environments, enters various cutscenes, and engages in various battles. It's not quite a souls-like, but based on combat encounters and enemy designs, you'd think it was one.

It is one of many upcoming Star Wars games in the works, but this one is all about speeding past Star Wars environments at several hundred kilometers per hour.</p><p>Galactic Racer certainly seems to pay homage to <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-episode-i-racer/"">Episode 1: Racer</a>, but that game was all about podracers, while Galactic Racer's trailer focused more on more types of vehicles, like speeders and speederbikes. The brief trailer showed lots of new models of vehicles we haven't seen before, but with a distinct Star Wars style.</p><p>The trailer also made use of the Star Wars sequel trilogy, showing a racetrack on Jakku in the shadow of the AT-AT graveyard, from Episode IX. It left off with a tease for Sebulba, the infamous racer who was rivals Anakin Skywalker in Episode 1. That's so wizard.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-galactic-racer-announced-the-game-awards/1100-6536876/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-12T13:47:16.367548
Warframe Turns To A Very Unexpected Person To Explain Its Lore: Werner Herzog,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/warframe/"">Warframe</a> has been hanging around in perpetual beta for well over a decade now. Even the developers joked about it at <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/"">The Game Awards</a> this year. The game may not be finished, but it still holds a whole world of mythology to dive into. And who better to reintroduce players to Warframe than documentarian and occasional actor, Werner Herzog. Although Herzog didn't appear in person, he left quite an impression in the trailer below.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_BBQBywJoE"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/v_BBQBywJoE"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>In terms of backstory and mythology, Warframe is a little convoluted. The short version is that players control Tenno, warriors who were asleep in suspended animation for centuries before being awakened in the middle of an intergalactic war. There have been 13 years of story expansions, and it's a little too much to take in all at once. And yet Herzog's delivery goes a long way toward making it sound very compelling.</p><p>""The Game Awards is a special night, and it's inspiring to see different industries come together to celebrate the craft of game making,"" Warframe creative director Rebecca Ford said in a statement. ""That's exactly why our partnership with Werner Herzog was so perfect for this trailer. He brought a totally fresh perspective to Warframe, embracing its strange beauty and human core. This collaboration allowed us to see our own world we created through different eyes, and we have never been more sure of Warframe's future for 2026 and beyond. Thank you to everyone who helped us survive for more than 12 years. We look forward to continuing to be weird and doing things our own way to serve our communities across every medium we can.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warframe-turns-to-a-very-unexpected-person-to-explain-its-lore-werner-herzog/1100-6536916/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-12T13:47:16.367548

"Blizzard Announces Next Diablo 4 Expansion, Two New Classes","<p>The end of Diablo 4's Age of Hatred saga is nigh. Blizzard has officially announced the game's second expansion, Lord of Hatred, is coming April 28, 2026. The expansion marks the end of Diablo 4's ongoing story, culminating in an epic battle against the MMO-ARPG's biggest antagonist: Mephisto.</p><p>Revealed as part of 2025's <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/"">The Game Awards</a>, Lord of Hatred sees players team up with an unlikely ally in an attempt to put an end to the Lord of Hatred's uprising. The expansion takes players to the fabled isles of Skovos, a region that was meant to appear in Diablo 3 before ultimately being cut, and serves as the former home of both Lilith and Inarius. In addition to finally taking us to these long-anticipated islands, Lord of Hatred also brings with it two new classes. While Blizzard has yet to reveal what one of these classes might be, the studio confirmed the fan-favorite Paladin is finally making their return. Those who preorder Diablo 4 Lord of Hatred will gain immediate access to the class, just in time for Season 11. Below are images offering a look at the Paladin, as well as some of its different builds. </p><figure data-embed-type=""gallery"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621493-paladin_zealot.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621494-paladin_judicator.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621495-paladin_disciple.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621496-paladin_juggernaut.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621497-dia_x2_basiliskmount_paladin_005.png"" data-ref-id=""1300-4621493,1300-4621494,1300-4621495,1300-4621496,1300-4621497"" data-resize-urls=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621493-paladin_zealot.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621494-paladin_judicator.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621495-paladin_disciple.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621496-paladin_juggernaut.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621497-dia_x2_basiliskmount_paladin_005.jpg""><div class=""image-gallery__label"">Gallery</div>   <div class=""image-gallery__list hide-scrollbar image-gallery__list--small"">       <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621493-paladin_zealot.png"">       <img src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621493-paladin_zealot.png"" alt=""Gallery image 1"" data-full-srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621493-paladin_zealot.png 1421w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4621493-paladin_zealot.png 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1639/16394322/4621493-paladin_zealot.png 480w"" />     </a>       <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621494-paladin_judicator.png"">       <img src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621494-paladin_judicator.png"" alt=""Gallery image 2"" data-full-srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621494-paladin_judicator.png 1311w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4621494-paladin_judicator.png 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1639/16394322/4621494-paladin_judicator.png 480w"" />     </a>       <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621495-paladin_disciple.png"">       <img src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621495-paladin_disciple.png"" alt=""Gallery image 3"" data-full-srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621495-paladin_disciple.png 1381w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4621495-paladin_disciple.png 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1639/16394322/4621495-paladin_disciple.png 480w"" />     </a>       <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621496-paladin_juggernaut.png"">       <img src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621496-paladin_juggernaut.png"" alt=""Gallery image 4"" data-full-srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621496-paladin_juggernaut.png 1603w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4621496-paladin_juggernaut.png 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1639/16394322/4621496-paladin_juggernaut.png 480w"" />     </a>       <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621497-dia_x2_basiliskmount_paladin_005.png"">       <img src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621497-dia_x2_basiliskmount_paladin_005.jpg"" alt=""Gallery image 5"" data-full-srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621497-dia_x2_basiliskmount_paladin_005.png 3840w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4621497-dia_x2_basiliskmount_paladin_005.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1639/16394322/4621497-dia_x2_basiliskmount_paladin_005.jpg 480w"" />     </a>   </div>  </figure><p>""The Paladin rises as the realm darkens, wielding hammer, shield, and Holy Light to smite Mephisto’s demon army with righteous fury,"" Blizzard wrote in its press release.

"First Street Fighter Movie Footage Looks Bright And Colorful, And Then They Beat Up A Car","<p>The very first trailer for the upcoming live-action Street Fighter movie was shown at <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/"">The Game Awards</a>, which gives us our first proper look at the roster in action. And honestly? It kinda rules.</p><p>The film, directed by Eric Andre Show and Twisted Metal alum Kitao Sakurai, appears to be far more colorful, stylized, and dialed into the wild side of this series than anyone expected. Suddenly, that wild, eclectic cast, which includes the likes of Cody Rhodes as Guile, Roman Reigns as Akuma, and David Dastmalchian as M. Bison, doesn't seem as out-of-pocket as it sounded on paper. Everyone just looks right, and the colors flying all around the place wouldn't feel out of place as a cutscene in Street Fighter 6.</p><p>You can check it out yourself below.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-street-fighter-movie-footage-looks-bright-colorful-and-then-they-beat-up-a-car/1100-6536912/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-12T13:47:16.367548

The Nintendo Switch 2 version has been delayed, coming out sometime later in 2026.</p><p>The new trailer also showcases not only more of the caped crusader in all of his Lego glory, but a glimpse at some of the other heroes lending him their talents, like Catwoman, Robin, Batgirl, and Nightwing. These characters also have special abilities based on their skills, such as Catwoman calling in a cat to take out a goon. There are also plenty of iconic Batmobiles and various other Bat-vehicles shown off, like the Batpod from The Dark Knight.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xciD-Vz6T_Q"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xciD-Vz6T_Q"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>The first solo Lego Batman since 2014's Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, this new adventure plays like a highlight reel of Dark Knight movies with a toyetic spin.

While the system is designed to be approachable with expanded windows of opportunity to block attacks, experienced players can dial up the difficulty to experience a challenge worthy of the world's greatest detective.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-releases-in-may/1100-6536781/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-12T13:47:16.367548

Take A Look At These Two Chappell Roan Fortnite Skins Coming This Week,"<p>After a few weeks of rumors, Epic Games finally revealed that Chappell Roan will be the next <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/"">Fortnite</a> Festival headlining artist when the new music pass launches on Thursday, February 5. As is usually the case with these things, Roan will have a skin, the Pink Pony Club jam track, and other cosmetics on the new Heartcore music pass, along with an additional set of items and jam tracks available for direct purchase in the item shop.</p><p>Buying the music pass--which is included with Fortnite Crew, or can be purchased on its own for 1400 V-Bucks--will instantly unlock the Chappell Roan skin. Players can then unlock the rest of the items on the pass, including several musical instruments and an additional style for the Chappell Roan skin, by gaining XP in any Fortnite mode. There should be a number of jam tracks other than Pink Pony Club included on the pass, but we don't know what they are yet.

Did Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 Hint That The Worst Fallout: New Vegas Ending Could Be Canon?,"<p>With The Ghoul reactivating Mr. House, Lucy discovering the mainframe of her father’s devices, and Maximus having to protect Freeside, the penultimate episode of Fallout season two raised the stakes for an all-out finale in New Vegas. Yet for as much time as this episode dedicated to building up relationships and faction statuses, episode seven still delivered the goods when it came to action and references to the original games. With that being said, let’s dive right in to this week’s easter eggs:</p><h3><strong>New (California) Threads</strong></h3><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1860/18602785/4645322-ncrmaximu.jpg"" data-ref-id=""1300-4645322"" data-ratio=""0.6974358974359"" data-width=""3900"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 3900px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1860/18602785/4645322-ncrmaximu.jpg""><img alt=""No Caption Provided"" src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1860/18602785/4645322-ncrmaximu.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1860/18602785/4645322-ncrmaximu.jpg 3900w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1860/18602785/4645322-ncrmaximu.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1860/18602785/4645322-ncrmaximu.jpg 480w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"" data-width=""1280""></a></figure><p>When The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) and Maximus realize they need to stock up to battle the Deathclaws that are overrunning the strip, they head to a secret New California Republic armory. While at first nothing seems to stand out amongst the arsenal of weapons, a single piece stands out: an NCR themed suit of power armor. While we’re not quite sure why this even exists, there’s no denying the power of good brand recognition.</p><h3><strong>Not A Ghoul But Something Much Worse</strong></h3><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1860/18602785/4645323-centaur.jpg"" data-ref-id=""1300-4645323"" data-ratio=""0.5625"" data-width=""1280"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 1280px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1860/18602785/4645323-centaur.jpg""><img alt=""No Caption Provided"" src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1860/18602785/4645323-centaur.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1860/18602785/4645323-centaur.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1860/18602785/4645323-centaur.jpg 480w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"" data-width=""1280""></a></figure><p>Throughout the episode, Thaddeus’ (Johnny Pemberton) condition worsens. Curious as to when his nose will fall off, he shows The Ghoul an alarming new mutation he’s developed: a gaping mouth growing in the center of his chest (in addition to his arm falling off). Now while it’s not quite confirmed what exactly he turning into, it’s definitely not a ghoul. For my money, he’s showing signs of turning into a Centaur. One of the most horrifying creatures in the Fallout universe.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/did-fallout-season-2-episode-7-hint-that-the-worst-fallout-new-vegas-ending-could-be-canon/1100-6537885/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-04T01:01:46.479506
Sony Files Patent For Generative-AI Podcast Starring Game Characters,"<p>Putting AI elements in games has already become a bigger part of the industry, and now Sony wants AI to talk about games as well. Sony has filed a patent for a generative AI podcast that would be starring its video game characters.</p><p>The <a href=""https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US471594142&amp;_cid=P22-MKTGE2-37885-1"">complete patent listing</a> for Sony's LLM-based generative podcast for gamers puts forth some ambitious ideas even though it doesn't settle every issue that may arise from them. According to the listing, Sony sees these podcasts as a way to reach individual gamers with news tailored to their tastes that comes in the form of an audio or video podcast hosted by the main character or characters of a game recently played on the console.</p><p>Deepfake voices will sidestep the need for actors, as the LLM creates banter and a news-like program that delivers tips, gaming news, and more games of interest to the player in question. The patent doesn't state if the generative podcast would be limited to Sony's proprietary characters or if it would extend to characters from third-party games.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-files-patent-for-generative-ai-podcast-starring-game-characters/1100-6537882/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-04T01:01:46.479506

Nintendo's $35 Talking Flower Will Briefly Tell You The Wrong Time,"<p>Nintendo recently held a hands-on showcase event with a bevy of demos for upcoming games. And while less of a focus than the games themselves, the presentation also included an opportunity for a closer look at some of its upcoming products like the new <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2-edition-features-playable-rosalina-17-new-minigames/1100-6537570/"">Mario Wonder Amiibo figures</a> and <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-selling-a-talking-flower/1100-6537571/"">$35 Talking Flower</a>. We had a chance to get hands on with the Alarmo-adjacent doodad and it is certainly a talking flower.</p><p>A brief video walked us through the functionality. It will say random phrases from time to time, and you can press a button on the front to prompt it to speak. You can set a wake-up time or bedtime so the flower will wish you well, and that way it'll stay quiet at night. The phrases shift based on the time of day, and it's attuned to the room temperature so it can tell you if it's a little chillier today, and it will alert you if it needs a battery change. In music mode it can activate a ""Wonder Mode,"" playing the Mario Wonder music.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR4W3e-_3zs"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uR4W3e-_3zs"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>The oddest feature, so to speak, is the ability to tell the time, but Talking Flower will sometimes tell you the <em>wrong</em> time.

"Apex Legends Adds Breachable Windows In Season 28, And Gives Fuse A Rocket Jump","<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/"">Apex Legends</a> Season 28 is also the start of the battle royale's Year 7, and the Respawn team is keeping to tradition by implementing a substantial gameplay change for the game's birthday. Season 28, titled Breach, introduces breakable windows and skylights to Apex Legends called Hardlight Meshes. These surfaces can be breached by squads trying to find additional ways into a building, or reinforced by players bunkering inside who are trying to hold a point-of-interest. These new mechanics sound like some you might find in <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/"">Rainbow Six Siege</a> (or <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/highguard-is-a-fresh-enough-combo-that-it-could-be-the-start-of-a-whole-new-thing/1100-6537648/"">Highguard</a>, the recently released raid shooter from former Apex Legends developers).</p><p dir=""ltr"">This isn't a small change, either. Hardlight Meshes will be added to all of the maps rotating into the battle royale playlists this season (World's Edge, Broken Moon, and E-District). Save for Olympus, these three maps have the most urban environments of all of Apex Legends' maps. That means there are plenty of buildings that have been remade by the sole conceit that they now have multiple breach points, making them significantly harder to defend.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRNJoZD_nvQ"" data-width=""854"" data-height=""480"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XRNJoZD_nvQ"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir=""ltr"">""As with all new additions to Apex, community feedback will certainly drive the conversation and inform our future updates and tuning,"" senior game designer Connor Monahan told me. ""Playtesting internally, the places where we feel Hardlight [has] the most [impact] fall into two big categories. The first category is buildings previously very difficult to assault that now have narrow weaknesses you can exploit to break in.

New Third-Person World War 2 Game Brings Nazi Hunting Up Close And Personal,"<p>For the last two decades, the vast majority of World War 2 games have been first-person shooters. ProbablyMonsters' upcoming title, Nekome: Nazi Hunter, is going to buck that trend with its single-player third-person experience. In the first teaser for the game, the main character demonstrates his abilities by fatally stabbing a Nazi soldier.</p><p>The lead character's name is Vano Nastasu, and he's not a soldier. He's a Romani who was persecuted by the Nazis and was subsequently unable to prevent his family from being murdered. However, Nastasu survived and now the hunted has become a hunter himself. His story of revenge will play out behind enemy lines across Europe during the war.</p><p>According to ProbablyMonsters, this game was inspired by grindhouse cinema. Players will be able stalk their prey, scout out enemy routes, and make their assassinations personal and precise. Nastasu has been given ""grounded finishing moves,"" which will come ""together in a symphony of violence where every encounter carries lasting consequences.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-third-person-world-war-2-game-brings-nazi-hunting-up-close-and-personal/1100-6537857/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-04T01:01:46.479506

Avowed itself lives within the Pillars of Eternity universe, of which there are multiple Obsidian-developed games, so it might not be surprising that this is where the studio is choosing to continue focusing efforts.</p><p>The interview delves into how the single studio managed to put out three games in a single year, with studio design director Josh Sawyer chalking it up to unexpected project timelines, scope pivots, and poor planning.

Highguard's 5v5 Experiment Is Now A Permanent Game Mode,"<p>Given how much has happened since, it might come as a surprise that <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/highguard/"">Highguard</a> has been out for just one week. Since then, the game has <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/highguard-getting-a-handful-of-fan-requested-features-today/1100-6537726/"">received a few patches</a>, and an entirely new game mode that is now going to stick around.</p><p>Over the weekend, Highguard developer Wildlight introduced a 5v5 game mode to sit alongside its standard 3v3 queues, stating that it would be a limited-time mode. Given the response by players, the new game mode has now become permanent, letting you enjoy the game's mix of looting and raiding with hopefully more player interactions in the large, open map. <a href=""https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2018459289933787412"">Wildlight announced the news on X</a>, stating that the player split between its two modes was relatively even across the weekend.</p><p>The addition of two more players on each team has been a favorable change to some players, with the game even emerging from its negative review status on Steam up to ""Mixed"" over the weekend.

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Has Somehow Sold Another 2.3 Million Copies In The Past Nine Months,"<p dir=""ltr"">Nintendo has revealed that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has sold another 2.39 million copies globally from April through December 2025, showcasing incredible staying power for the nearly nine-year-old Switch game. What's even more impressive is this number comes during a timeframe that saw the launch of Switch 2 exclusive <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-world-review/1900-6418371/"">Mario Kart World</a> in June.</p><p dir=""ltr"">The newest sales figure comes from Nintendo's <a href=""https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203_3e.pdf"">financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2026</a>, which runs from April 1, 2025 through March 31, 2026. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was the third best-selling original Switch game during that timespan. Meanwhile, newcomers <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-legends-z-a-review-a-battle-revolution/1900-6418423/"">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> and Super Mario Galaxy 2 took the top two spots, with 8.41 million and 2.42 million copies sold worldwide, respectively.

How Mario Tennis Fever Sets Itself Apart From Other Recent Mario Sports Games,"<p dir=""ltr"">Mario's sports spin-offs during the Switch era have been mostly decent, but also, largely unsurprising. There have been few frills and largely anemic single-player modes, and the occasional experiment like Mario Golf Super Rush have been divisive. Mario Tennis Fever is the first in the sport spin-off genre on Switch 2, and a chance to set a new course for the company. After a hands-on with it at a recent Nintendo event, I can't say whether it has course-corrected on the single-player, but the multiplayer is so chockablock with options and game-changing effects that I'm intrigued.</p><p dir=""ltr"">In fact, the main hook of the new game--the titular Fever rackets--have such wild impacts on the court that at times Fever felt more like a party game than a sports title. Our couch competitive experience was frequently interrupted by raucous trash talk and surprised screams as new effects totally changed the match mid-volley.</p><p dir=""ltr"">But first, the basics. A short tutorial explained the mechanics of Mario Tennis Fever, which are largely unchanged from previous tennis titles. You serve and volley just as you'd expect, and you hit the button early or double-tap for charged and powered-up effects, respectively. Mario and the gang look especially great here, thanks to the enhanced power of the Switch 2 and relatively limited scope of what's on screen.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-mario-tennis-fever-sets-itself-apart-from-other-recent-mario-sports-games/1100-6537844/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-04T01:01:46.479506
Super Mario Wonder Turns Into Mario Party With The Bellabel Park Expansion,"<p dir=""ltr"">So far, Nintendo's Switch 2 upgrade packs have been all over the map. There are the smaller ones with just a few quality-of-life features like Animal Crossing, serious upgrades like the Legend of Zelda games, and larger-scale expansions like Kirby's Star-Crossed World expansion. Super Mario Bros. Wonder's Switch 2 upgrade, Meetup at Bellabel Park, is priced like a larger expansion, but that doesn't quite capture the nature of what it is. Instead, based on a hands-on experience with Nintendo, it transforms the game into something else entirely, borrowing liberally from the Mario Party series.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Though Mario Wonder allowed you to go through its stages in multiplayer, Bellabel Park is centered around bespoke multiplayer minigames, using the Mario Wonder platforming as its mechanical underpinnings. So unlike an actual Mario Party game, in which the randomized minigames might challenge you to do new and unfamiliar things at a regular clip, these feel more like platforming challenges with a little bit of party game spirit.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Since they're built around traditional Mario platforming, the challenges aren't entirely competitive. We first played a cooperative level that had one player using the Switch 2 mouse functionality to draw Donut Blocks, Mario Maker style, to guide the other three players through a stage that was one big pit hazard. That by itself would be not much more than a neat toy-like experiment, but the stage was also littered with occasional hazards and puzzle challenges, like a special coin nested inside a set of breakable boxes. The Donut Block player would need to draw a path for a spike ball to roll its way into the boxes so that the other players could access the coin; and naturally, we were all shouting out tips of where and how to draw the path, adding to the chaotic fun of the whole experience.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-wonder-turns-into-mario-party-with-the-bellabel-park-expansion/1100-6537843/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-04T01:01:46.479506
Switch 2's Virtual Boy Is For A Very Specific Type Of Nintendo Fan,"<p dir=""ltr"">Nintendo doesn't have very many high-profile missteps, which makes it all the more notorious when one of its flagship products falters. The Wii U is the most recent example, but before that the all-timer was the Virtual Boy--a mid-'90s experiment in early 3D effects that never caught on. Nintendo fans have identified many possible causes for this--the unwieldy design, the all-red graphics, the middling library--but whatever the cause, it's been a sore spot in Nintendo history. Now the company is bringing it back with emulation and two accessory options (one or the other is required) on the Switch 2. It works well, but will likely serve more as a museum piece for fans of Nintendo history than a strong part of the gaming library.</p><p dir=""ltr"">During a Nintendo event, we were able to try the Virtual Boy emulation, with a Switch 2 console fitted into the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pass-is-adding-nintendos-biggest-flop-virtual-boy/1100-6534695/"">pricey Virtual Boy accessory</a>. (The cardboard model was on display behind glass, but we weren't able to try it.) The $100 option looks just like my memory of a Virtual Boy in a Toys R Us kiosk, complete with its tripod stand and foam face shield. The only major differences are that this one has a Switch 2 noticeably lodged into it, and there is no attached controller since you'll just use paired Joy-Cons or Pro Controller. It was notable, more as an interesting curiosity than anything else, that about half of the Switch console was actually sticking out of the bottom of the Virtual Boy accessory. The actual Virtual Boy display was only utilizing roughly the top half of the screen.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Then there's the experience of actually putting hands (and eyes) on it. The foam face shield was actually very comfortable and did a great job blocking out the ambient light of the room. Hunching over to get my eyes in the correct position was less comfortable, but I learned afterwards that I would have been allowed to adjust the table height on request, so that may just be user error on my part. Still, it does raise the specter of one key weakness of the Virtual Boy: You have to find a position to play and stay planted there, rather than naturally shift around as people tend to do when relaxing with a video game. The field-of-view was slightly odd, also, as I had to lift my head up above the face shield slightly and look down ""into"" the display to see the part of the UI that explained the suspend menu shortcut. And of course, the red-and-black display does still feel fairly harsh, and emerging from the darkened cocoon of the Virtual Boy display is disorienting.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-virtual-boy-is-for-a-very-specific-type-of-nintendo-fan/1100-6537842/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-04T01:01:46.479506
Resident Evil Requiem And Pragmata Are Impressive Switch 2 Showpieces,"<p dir=""ltr"">The Nintendo Switch was a massive success, but it was built primarily on the strength of first-party and less-demanding third-party games. We all knew you didn't turn to the Switch for the visual splendor offered on its competitors. The Switch 2 has brought things slightly more towards parity, and we've seen a few third-party standouts like Cyberpunk 2077 and Star Wars Outlaws that push the hardware. Those will soon be joined by two high-profile Capcom games, Resident Evil Requiem and Pragmata, which were both visually impressive at a recent Nintendo hands-on event.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Both demos on display were familiar ones. For Resident Evil, it was the opening moments as Grace begins exploring the hospital that we've seen demonstrated in other presentations, and for Pragmata it was the same demo that's available on Steam now. But that also allows a direct comparison, and to my surprise, it was pretty favorable in both cases.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Resident Evil Requiem looked great, maintaining the high-fidelity distressed look that lends itself to the creepy atmosphere. Things in the hospital look worn and used, sometimes decaying, which helps set a mood, and the Switch 2 pulled off that look very well. In handheld mode, the smaller screen may have looked even better than on a big screen, since the more compact pixel density could hide some of the less-detailed parts. Plus, with the ability to play on a handheld you could play it in bed, hiding under the covers.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-and-pragmata-are-impressive-switch-2-showpieces/1100-6537841/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-04T01:01:46.479506

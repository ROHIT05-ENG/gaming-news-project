To celebrate the incoming launch, the developer has announced it will be hosting a Server Slam <strong>coming 26th February 26 and running until 2nd March</strong>. Which, for my money, is perilously close to the official release on 5th March.

""Obviously we do all of the rendering things. We're really happy with all of the new stuff that we're doing, but also world systems, loading, how we bring things into the world, [and] how we get that detail close to the camera immediately.""</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX4rKpB97L4"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sX4rKpB97L4"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Creation Engine is the game engine that Bethesda created during the development of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.

"Switch 2 Game's ""Camera As Controller"" Mode Will Let You Harness A Baby's Superpowers","<p>When Skybound Games' <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/goodnight-universe/"">Goodnight Universe</a> launched late last year, the Switch 2 version lacked the game's ""camera as controller"" mode to allow players to use their face and body to control the action. As of today, an update has been added to Goodnight Universe's Switch 2 port that will enable those controls.</p><p>The game casts players in the role of Isaac, a six-month-old baby whose recollections are narrated to the player by Lewis Pullman, who portrays Isaac as an adult. What makes Isaac unique are his advanced intelligence for his age and his telekinetic abilities. Isaac can move objects with his mind, and the ""camera as controller"" mode lets players guide the action with their eyes.</p><p>Skybound has also shared a guide to setting up the Switch 2's camera to get the best results out of Goodnight Universe. In addition to needing a well-lit space to play, players need to ensure that their faces are fully visible too. The setup will also ask players to blink, smile, and frown, as all three of those actions can be used to control Isaac's actions under specific circumstances.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-games-camera-as-controller-mode-will-let-you-harness-a-babys-superpowers/1100-6538268/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-19T12:35:57.046390

How To Open Locked Chests In Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined,"<p>Doesn’t matter which one it is, if a game spends hours telling you you can break open everything not nailed down, if they start putting locks on things, you’re gonna take that Michael Jordan-level personally. Even in its newfangled Reimagined form, <em>Dragon Quest 7</em> is no different, you’ll eventually start running into chests that won’t open, and what’s worse, because chests aren’t specifically color-coded here, you won’t know what key opens what kind of chest till you try to open it. While letting Maribel complain at them until they surrender their contents sounds like a grand idea on paper, we might suggest finding a few keys for these things might go a little easier. We’ll show you where you’re headed for these.</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>The Thief Key</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">So, in general, you’re gonna want to tackle as many of these chests as you can once you get access to their specific areas, since the time jump mechanic means some of these locations can be locked or blocked off if you progress a bit too far too fast. Fortunately, they’re all very much on your way through the main story. You’ll find the Thief Key when you’ve handled your business in Alltrades Abbey. Once you’re able to roam freely after taking down Cardinal Sin, head back to Pilgrim’s Perdition, and head to the weird little hostel at the north of town next to a well. The NPCs that were guarding the chest here will be gone, and you can grab the key in here. Even better, you can use it right away by opening the other chest in here for a Mini-Medal.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-open-locked-chests-in-dragon-quest-7-reimagined/1100-6538148/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-19T12:35:57.046390

The inventor has an assortment of patents, both granted and pending, under his name that extends to a broad array of fields, including barcodes and QR codes.

Kirby Creator’s Joke Is So Dark Even Kirby Might Spit It Out,"<p>Kirby creator Masahiro Sakurai recently posted some snaps of his meal at one of Japan's Kirby Cafes, and it wasn't long before he pulled a knife on his favorite child.

All Roblox Star Fishing Star Locations,"<p>Looking for a specific star to complete a quest? Chances are that you could be fishing in the wrong place, as some spots exclusively house certain types of star systems. This <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roblox-games/2900-6830/"">Roblox game</a> isn’t a massively complex one to play, but it does require a lot of grinding for cash, quests, and other equipment to maximize your catch.</p><p dir=""ltr"">However, even though fishing is relatively painless, particularly if you opt to craft rings from Mythic and higher rarity stars, you may find that there are a handful of them that require one of the two temporary-spawning locations: The Eye and Negative Galaxy. You’ll see prompts when these areas appear, and, as of right now, they’re the hot spots for the rarest stars. Incidentally, potions can give you a bit of a boost, and our list of <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-fishing-codes/1100-6538241/"">Star Fishing codes</a> can give you a few gems to help you get started.</p><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4653400-star-fishing-eye.jpg"" data-ref-id=""1300-4653400"" data-ratio=""0.5625"" data-width=""1920"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 1920px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4653400-star-fishing-eye.jpg""><img alt=""No Caption Provided"" src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1861/18616975/4653400-star-fishing-eye.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4653400-star-fishing-eye.jpg 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1861/18616975/4653400-star-fishing-eye.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1861/18616975/4653400-star-fishing-eye.jpg 480w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"" data-width=""1280""></a></figure><h2 dir=""ltr"">Star Fishing star locations</h2><p dir=""ltr"">Here are all the spawning points for every rarity in Star Fishing.

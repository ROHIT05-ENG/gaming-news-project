"Yakuza Kiwami 3 Puts Kiryu Into Ultimate Dad Mode, And It's Glorious","<p>It's been three months since the announcement of <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties/"">Yakuza Kiwami 3</a>, the highly anticipated remake of the 2009 classic <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/yakuza-3/"">Yakuza 3</a>. After seeing how gorgeous the game looks and plays smoothly in the Dragon Engine, on top of the newly added Mine Saga ""Dark Ties"", I've been desperately waiting for more content to be revealed, especially when it comes to Kiryu's island life. Last week, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio announced some of the new features coming to Yakuza Kiwami 3 that gave me even more hope that this is going to be another awesome Yakuza game, and afterward, I finally got a chance to go into full island dad mode with an extended preview demo that left me even more excited for this remake.</p><p>Unlike all the Yakuza/Like a Dragon games out so far, Yakuza 3 sees Kiryu living a somewhat peaceful life. After the conflict with Omi Alliance in Yakuza 2/Kiwami 2, Kiryu moves to Okinawa to run the Morning Glory Orphanage with his adoptive daughter, Haruka. The first half of the game focuses on his relationship with the kids at the orphanage, watching sunsets with Haruka, and engaging in silly substories as a father figure.</p><p>Although it would seem like seeing Kiryu let his guard down and go into dad mode would be enjoyable, I found the orphanage content to be pretty disappointing in the original game. Slowly walking around the house felt clunky and outdated even back in 2009, where opening every door welcomed a new loading screen--it got pretty irritating, pretty fast. It was a slog having to interact with each kid, an activity that came with very little reward. I remember finishing the game and wishing there was a better focus on Kiryu's life on the island, considering it's one of the only ""wholesome"" parts of Kiryu's saga we get to witness.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yakuza-kiwami-3-puts-kiryu-into-ultimate-dad-mode-and-its-glorious/1100-6537403/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-16T12:21:21.997919

From Software has released a new Nightreign Version 1.03.2 update that re-balances some of the weaker Nightfarers into more formidable heroes across all consoles and PC versions of the game.</p><p>As laid out on the official page for <a href=""https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1032"">Elden Ring</a>, Guardians received a damage negation buff as well as an increase to the Guard Boost ability.

Resident Evil Requiem Showcase Reveals Grace And Leon Gameplay Differences,"<p>Capcom's <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-showcase-coming-thursday-includes-brand-new-requiem-footage/1100-6537372/"">Resident Evil Requiem Showcase</a> didn't reveal much about the story, but it did go into detail about how the game will change depending upon which character you're playing, and the title will also introduce new difficulty settings to the franchise. The new heroine, Grace Ashcroft, will represent a more classic, horror-focused approach to gameplay, similar to <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-2/"">Resident Evil 2</a> and <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-6/"">6</a>. But when players are in control of Leon S. Kennedy, the tone of the game will shift to a more action-oriented style like <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/"">Resident Evil 4</a>.</p><p>It doesn't sound like players will get to choose which character they will control, since certain parts of the story are meant for one or the other. Although Grace is physically weaker than Leon, she will have some abilities to make up for that. She will be able to craft weapons using the blood of the infected. And when Grace needs to shoot her way out of trouble, she'll have a powerful gun called Requiem to fall back on. To keep players from relying only on Requiem, the ammo will be limited.</p><p>RE Requiem is also introducing some new difficulty settings. The easiest mode is Casual, which lets players concentrate on the story and gives them an aim assist. Standard difficulty is a little harder, while Standard (Classic) won't let players save their games without finding a limited number of ink ribbons to use. That's a throwback to the save system in the older games in the franchise.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-showcase-reveals-grace-and-leon-gameplay-differences/1100-6537447/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-16T12:21:21.997919

You're reading stories on this site called GameSpot, so it's safe to assume that you love to play some video games, too. However, we all need to be careful with how long we play video games because a new study suggests that logging too many hours could seriously hurt our physical, emotional, and mental health.</p><p>In <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900725003685?via%3Dihub"">a new study published in ScienceDirect's Nutrition journal</a> and <a href=""https://medicalxpress.com/news/2026-01-reveals-hours-video-games-week.html"">reported on by Medical Xpress</a>, 10 different researchers from around the world investigated the effects ""excessive gaming"" has on young people. Led by Professor Mario Siervo of the Curtin School of Population Health in Perth, Western Australia, and surveying 317 students from five Australian universities with a median age of 20 years old, the study found that ""high gamers""--people whose playtime exceeded 10 hours a week--were at greater risk of dietary issues, sleep deprivation, and weight gain.</p><p>""What stood out was students gaming up to 10 hours a week all looked very similar in terms of diet, sleep, and body weight,"" Siervo said.

Expensive biosynthetic shells that house the consciousness of a person inside of them, each Runner shell is also highly customizable, and developer Bungie has outlined how players can fine-tune each one to help them survive Tau Ceti.</p><p>Each Runner shell is built to focus on a different gameplay archetype--like intel gathering, combat disruption, or combat healing--and their visual design makes them easy to distinguish from a distance, so you'll know how to deal with one in the heat of battle. Players can customize their Runner shell using the cores, implants, weapons, and mods they bring with them on each run, and they can also be visually customized with cosmetics earned from a variety of sources.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFzR8bN13FA"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jFzR8bN13FA"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>For example, players can go all in on agility, modifying the ""Combat Anarchist"" Vandal shell to be a scout that can triple-jump and quickly move across the map. Prefer to cause some chaos instead? Then you'll want to invest in mods that give you a tactical advantage in the air and allow you to cause some splash damage when you land. Cores--powerful standalone perks--also have the potential to be combined to create interesting effects.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-new-rook-shell-is-a-big-win-for-solo-players/1100-6537430/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-16T12:21:21.997919

Nvidia Ending RTX 5070Ti Production Amid RAM Price Crisis - Report,"<p>The ongoing RAM shortages and the associated increase in RAM prices are starting to affect other pieces of hardware that make use of fast memory. Graphics cards are especially susceptible, which has seemingly forced Nvidia to start discontinuing at least two 50-series cards that ship with 16GB of VRAM.</p><p>A report by Hardware Unboxed states that several GPU manufactueres have designated both the RTX 5070Ti and the 16GB version of the RTX 5060Ti as ""end of life,"" meaning that no new stock is being produced.

"Fatal Fury Fans Spot Strange Detail In New Trailer, Igniting Generative AI Controversy","<p>The use of generative AI in video games has been controversial to say the least, but when it comes to art, the blowback has been even stronger. One game currently being accused of using the technology is<a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves/""> Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</a>, as the new trailer for the fighting game's upcoming second season of DLC characters is being picked apart online. Viewers and commenters have pored over the trailer, claiming that the character designs are inconsistent and that certain visual elements contain generative AI. The biggest smoking gun, according to viewers, is a quick shot of series antagonist Geese Howard, who appears to be missing an entire foot.</p><p>Other instances of generative AI pointed out include Blue Mary's motorcycle missing several vital components--and being a completely different model from what she normally rides--and Kim Jae Hoon having noticeably different wardrobes between his cinematic and gameplay character models. We have reached out to the developer, SNK, for details on the trailer and will update this post as soon as we hear back.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqe1RBmJ9S8"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tqe1RBmJ9S8"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>If Fatal Fury is using generative AI, it wouldn't be the first game to do so.

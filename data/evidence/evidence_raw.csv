It's never easy to know what to do, we're all trying our best - after all this is all our first time being human. But one truth remains:a little kindness goes a long way. Winter Burrow, the intrepid little mouse game, shows this more than anything else I've played in 2025.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/in-2025-winter-burrow-showed-how-a-little-kindness-goes-a-long-way"">Read more</a></p>",2026-01-07T00:54:29.129864

"Balatro and Silksong ""Don't Make Sense Financially"" And Are ""Deeply Loved,"" Says Analyst","<p>Balatro and Hollow Knight: Silksong ""shouldn't exist,"" according to industry analyst Joost van Dreunen. He elaborated that, ""They don't make rational sense financially, and yet somehow they are deeply loved."" Their commercial viability is an undeniable fact. However, the scale of their success baffles industry conventional wisdom.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Van Drunen is professor at the NYU Stern School of Business and a strategic advisor for the community development agency ELO. In an interview with <a href=""https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nobody-wants-ai-slop-joost-van-dreunen-on-the-future-of-ai-and-the-shifting-economics-of-the-games-industry"">GameIndustry.biz</a>, van Dreunen discussed how the shifting macroeconomics of video games is creating space for smaller projects to become massive successes. He compares the shift to the way television challenged the Hollywood business model. Free-to-play games like Candy Crush compete with, and even undermine, big-budget blockbusters like GTA or Call of Duty. Yet, there are an increasing number of games that skirt outside either model, such as Silksong.</p><p dir=""ltr"">The lower-tech production values of some indie games may also be a big asset. Van Dreunen said, ""I'm a big fan of the idea that low tech is a much more interesting design factor than high tech. I think, demonstrably, whenever new technology comes out, what studios tend to do is just increase the final product. They make it more complex, and therefore they negate the productivity gains."" Perhaps Balatro and Silksong can be impressive with smaller budgets and development teams because they leverage the productivity shifts bigger studios would use to expand their efforts.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatro-and-silksong-dont-make-sense-financially-and-are-deeply-loved-says-analyst/1100-6537220/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-07T00:54:29.129864

Rhythm Games Are Marching To The Beat Of Their Own Drum,"<p>Unbeatable introduces itself with a simple, yet punchy premise: we find a group of teens in a band, on the run from and getting into fights with the local authority. The twist? Instead of playing out as a traditional story-driven game, the beating drum of the experience is structured around rhythm-based gameplay.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Sequences such as dreams and combat encounters are all guided by Unbeatable's take on the classic Guitar Hero notes-on-a-fretboard style gameplay, in which prompts tell you which buttons to press in time with the music. Here, it's only two buttons: up and down. And while there are more traditional gameplay moments--like minigames where you must memorize movement patterns and react to the beat of different tempos--in a similar fashion to Rhythm Heaven, it's the harmonious intersection with all the game's other sections, which would normally play out as mere cutscenes, that makes Unbeatable stand out.</p><p dir=""ltr"">A decade ago, right around the time that Rock Band and Guitar Hero launched their respective swansongs marking the decline of the domestic rhythm game era, it would have been novel to see a studio blend rhythm game mechanics into a narrative adventure. But Unbeatable is just one example of this approach; dozens of studios have been toying with the intersection of music games with other genres. Now, 10 years after the rhythm game heyday, they're basking in a renewed appreciation of those elements.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rhythm-games-are-marching-to-the-beat-of-their-own-drum/1100-6537211/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-07T00:54:29.129864
Arc Raiders Snap And Salvage Quest Guide,"<p>If you're working your way through Stella Montis, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a>' first post-launch map, you may have the Snap and Salvage quest. This multi-step quest requires you to find multiple spots of interaction, as well as recover some specific pieces of loot. It can take some time to figure all of this out on your own, so we've put together a step-by-step process to get you through it.</p><p>Note that each part of this quest can be completed across multiple runs, so there's no need to wrap it all up in a single raid. That being said, you'll need to extract with the Magnetron and Flow Controller items once you find them, so it's probably best to bring in an augment that has a safe pocket or two to ensure you don't accidentally lose these precious items if you find them during your raid.</p><p>Here's how to complete Snap and Salvage in Arc Raiders.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-snap-and-salvage-quest-guide/1100-6536231/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-07T00:54:29.129864

"Obsidian Was The Only Choice For Fallout: New Vegas, Says Todd Howard","<p>This year marks the 15th anniversary of <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-new-vegas/"">Fallout: New Vegas</a>, the beloved spin-off that was developed by Obsidian Entertainment. Bethesda hasn't entrusted the franchise to many other developers, and according to studio boss Todd Howard, Obsidian was the only choice to take on New Vegas.</p><p>""They were the only choice,"" Howard told <a href=""https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/12/16/crawl-out-through-the-fallout"">Game Informer</a> (via <a href=""https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/todd-howard-says-obsidian-was-the-only-choice-for-fallout-new-vegas-aside-from-the-studios-fallout-dna-devs-did-something-similar-with-star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-2/"">GamesRadar</a>).

These New Lego Star Wars Smart Play Sets Mix Bricks With Tech,"<p>At CES 2026 this week, Lego introduced its brand-new Smart Play system--a series of high-tech Lego bricks, tiles, and minifigures equipped with sensors, accelerometers, light and sound sensors, a miniature speaker with an onboard synthesizer, and more. The company says these pieces can communicate to enhance interactivity. The system will launch in March with three Star Wars sets, available for preorder starting January 9.</p><p>While this isn't the first time Lego has experimented with electronic components, there are key differences with Smart Play pieces. For starters, they can detect nearby NFC-equipped smart tags. They're also wirelessly charged. This is a big improvement compared to the Lego Super Mario toys, which required AAA batteries to function.</p><p>All of the pieces work with standard Lego bricks. Each piece contains a custom-made chip that is smaller than a standard Lego stud. So what do they do exactly? Lego says the Smart Bricks will respond to actions with appropriate sounds and behaviors. Here's a closer look at what you can expect, starting with the new Lego Star Wars sets that will make use of this technology.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/these-new-lego-star-wars-smart-play-sets-mix-bricks-with-tech/1100-6537194/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-07T00:54:29.129864

The 8BitDo Ultimate 3E will retail for $150, placing it squarely in competition with Microsoft's own <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20"">Elite Series 2</a> and other licensed Xbox controllers such as the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Desktop/dp/B0DS6PZL6Z?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Razer Wolverine V3 Pro</a>, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FD69BD3P,B0FD6JGJ4L,B0CQ3PJKRV,B0CQ3NL4QG&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded</a>, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Revolution-Unlimited-Controller-Officially-Xbox-X/dp/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Nacon Revolution X Unlimited</a>, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Wireless-Controller-Licensed-Xbox-X/dp/B0CJVQFZ1S?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra</a>, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FPXG11NM,B0FPXJYFRQ&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Scuf Valor Pro</a>, and <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FWRP6733,B0F29F712R,B0G2XZXL63&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20"">GameSir G7 Pro</a>.</p><hr /><div title=""[8BitDo] 8BitDo Ultimate 3E Controller (Xbox/PC)"" data-embed-type=""buylink"" data-ref-id=""5369"" data-template=""2"" data-size=""buylink__large"" data-title=""[8BitDo] 8BitDo Ultimate 3E Controller (Xbox/PC)"" data-collection="""" class=""norewrite"">    <div class=""buylink__container"">                                                                                                                                                                                               <div class=""buylink__item"">                  <div class=""buylink__image-container clickable"">                                            <img class=""buylink__image"" src=https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4629319-8bitdoultimate3econtroller.png alt="""">                                 <a href=""https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-3e-controller-xbox/""></a>                              </div>                   <div class=""buylink__text"">                      <p class=""buylink__title text-bold"">                        <a href=""https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-3e-controller-xbox/"">8BitDo Ultimate 3E Wireless Controller for Xbox/PC</a>           </p>                                                       <p class=""buylink__deck"">                          <a href=""https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-3e-controller-xbox/"">$150 | Releases Q2 2026</a>             </p>                                              </div>                  <div class=""buylink__links"">                                                                                                                                                          <a href=""https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-3e-controller-xbox/"">See at 8BitDo</a>                     </div>                         </div>                     </div> </div><p>Unsurprisingly, the 8BitDo Ultimate 3E is the most feature-rich and technologically advanced controller in 8BitDo's catalog.

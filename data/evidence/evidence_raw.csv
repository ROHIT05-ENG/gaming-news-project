It's unclear if the Deluxe Edition's publisher Yen Press is including a new--hopefully more faithful--translation or the controversial script from the English editions published by TokyoPop. While the Japanese version of the manga closely follows the original novel's plot, the English adaptation--handled by veteran comic book writer Keith Griffen--made substantial changes, resulting in several major plot holes in the later volumes.</p><p>Either way, considering TokyoPop's releases have been out of print for several years, this new Deluxe Edition will be the easiest way to read the manga adaptation of the wildly popular franchise. Volume 1 launches on January 27, and we expect the next volumes in the series to go up for preorder in the near future.</p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Battle-Royale-Deluxe-Masayuki-Taguchi/dp/B0FGX87VKB?tag=gamespot-preorders-20"">Preorder at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>   </div> </div><p> </p><p>Battle Royale would receive several sequel manga series over the years, but most of these are also hard to find due to their limited print runs.

New Vegas Dev Doesn't Agree With Bethesda's Take On Fallout,"<p>So much time has passed between Fallout games that modern players may believe the lighthearted comedic tone of Fallout 4, Fallout '76, and Prime Video's Fallout series were the way the franchise has always been portrayed. But Chris Avellone--one of the designers of <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-2/"">Fallout 2</a> and a writer for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-new-vegas/"">Fallout: New Vegas</a>--believes that Bethesda has lost sight of the way that the games were originally intended to be received.</p><p>When asked on X whether Bethesda hates the franchise, Avellone responded, ""They just don't fully understand its roots and arguably, don't care--they own the franchise, and they just want to do their spin on Fallout and make that the norm. This usually translates into a colorful, shallow theme park (with some interesting DLC exceptions, like Far Harbor, Point Lookout--and I was one of the ones who liked The Pitt)--still, theme parks are fun for some folks, so if people enjoy it, that's fine with me.""</p><div data-embed-type=""tweet"" data-src=""https://twitter.com/ChrisAvellone/status/2009456971339149774?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2009456971339149774%7Ctwgr%5E99f1ee048f913fdce98a2199dfe0f1e4cd7a6c94%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.windowscentral.com%2Fgaming%2Fzenimax-bethesda%2Flead-fallout-new-vegas-dev-says-bethesda-strayed-away-from-the-rpgs-origins"" data-has-image=""false""><blockquote align=""center"" class=""twitter-tweet"" data-conversation=""none"" data-mce-disable-toolbar=""true""><p dir=""ltr"">This usually translates into a colorful, shallow theme park (with some interesting DLC exceptions, like Far Harbor, Point Lookout - and I was one of the ones who liked The Pitt) – still, theme parks are fun for some folks, so if people enjoy it, that’s fine with me.</p>  — Chris Avellone (@ChrisAvellone) <a href=""https://twitter.com/ChrisAvellone/status/2009456971339149774?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">January 9, 2026</a></blockquote>          <text></text>    </div><p>Avellone went on to explain that he doesn't hate Bethesda, and he praised the publisher's open-world games before calling out its weaknesses regarding its linear stories and ""their inability to understand how to use the Speech skill.

The hardcover is over 800 pages in size, and it includes all the manga series, the ""lost"" stories from Ghost in the Shell 2: Man-Machine Interface, notes on the series, all of the original cover pages, and cover art that Shirow illustrated specially for it.</p><p>Set in a not-so-distant future, Ghost in the Shell follows the cyborg Major Motoko Kusanagi and other members of the counter-terrorist group Section 9. The cyberpunk manga examines how crime has evolved in this new age of brain jacks, neural chips, military drones, and optical camo. The manga was adapted into a film in 1995, which remains a landmark piece of animation that influenced a generation of anime and Western filmmakers alike, including the Matrix trilogy. If you're interested in checking out the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Shell-4k-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B08CJTQ91J?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Ghost in the Shell film, it made the leap to 4K</a> a few years ago. This version includes an audio commentary, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and the original theatrical trailer. The film spawned its own unique sequels, spin-offs, and reboots, including <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Shell-2-Innocence-Blu-ray/dp/B01N1FNDWG?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence</a> and the acclaimed <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Shell-Complex-Season-Blu-ray/dp/B01NBHMO5B?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a> anime series.

This edition includes all 26 episodes with English audio, the original Japanese audio with subtitles, hours of bonus features, and two films. The first Evangelion film, Death (True), is essentially a clip show that recaps the series, and The End of Evangelion is a retelling of the final two episodes.</p><p>Anyone who's familiar with the series will want to check out the four Rebuild of Evangelion movies. Released in four parts from 2007 to 2021, the project began as an almost shot-for-shot remake of the early episodes before introducing major changes to the established story, introducing new plotlines and characters. Shout Factory has released all of them to date, both as standard and limited-edition Blu-rays.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evangelion-eva-unit-02-razer-collection-preorder-guide/1100-6537354/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-14T12:21:58.824720
"Split Fiction Director Defends EA, Saying ""Everybody’s Done Something That’s Not Good""","<p>Electronic Arts has never been a particularly popular company in the eyes of consumers, but Hazelight Studios founder Josef Fares, who collaborated on three titles with the publisher, was willing to go up to bat for it during a recent interview.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=""https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would"">The Game Business</a>, the Split Fiction director said that there are ""a lot of great people at EA"" who ""respect"" Hazelight's work and ""leave [them] be.""

The Division 2 Is Getting A Game-Changing New Mode,"<p>Tom Clancy's<em> The Division</em> is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, but <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-2/"">The Division 2</a> players are the ones who are getting a gift. An update coming this March will add a Realism Mode to The Division 2, giving fans a new way to experience the game.</p><p>Realism Mode is only available for players who purchased the Warlords of New York expansion. The mode itself is a stripped down version of the game that drops or modifies some of the series' traditional elements, like the HUD, the map, and hitmarkers, as well as XP and leveling progression. Instead, players will have to adjust to a completely rebalanced arsenal and a reality where shooting a foe in an arm or a leg isn't very effective anymore. But headshots still work, which is good news considering that ammo will be much harder to find in this mode.</p><div data-embed-type=""tweet"" data-src=""https://twitter.com/ChitoGamingLive/status/2010636675354181804"" data-has-image=""true""><blockquote align=""center"" class=""twitter-tweet"" data-conversation=""none"" data-mce-disable-toolbar=""true""><p dir=""ltr"">The Division 2 Realism Mode announced for March 2026 for their 10 anniversary celebration <br />Also Year 8 <br /> <a href=""https://t.co/INO8Q0BrF9"">pic.twitter.com/INO8Q0BrF9</a></p>  — Chito (@ChitoGamingLive) <a href=""https://twitter.com/ChitoGamingLive/status/2010636675354181804?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">January 12, 2026</a></blockquote>          <text></text>    </div><p>In the announcement video above, the Ubisoft team revealed that the upcoming anniversary season will feature a collaboration with another Tom Clancy creation, but further details about that particular collaboration weren't shared.

This  sought-after art book has been out of print for almost a year, so its worth picking it up now that it's available, as it's possible it could sell out again.</p><div title=""6537163 -- Okami: Official Complete Works"" data-embed-type=""buylink"" data-ref-id=""5365"" data-template=""4"" data-size=""buylink__listicle"" data-title=""6537163 -- Okami: Official Complete Works"" data-collection="""" class=""norewrite"">  <div class=""buylink-container"">                                                                     <div class=""js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container"">             <h2 class=""item-title"">                    <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/1897376022?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Okami: Official Complete Works (Softcover)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=""item-deck"">                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/1897376022?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">$35.65 (was $40)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=""image-container"">                                  <img class=""main-image"" src=https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1601/16018044/4629235-okami-square.jpg>                             <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/1897376022?tag=gamespot-promos-20""></a>                        </div>              <div class=""item-description""><p>First released in 2008, this 288-page book showcases the artwork from the video game, inspired by classic Japanese Sumi-e ink paintings.

Split Fiction Boss Hopes AA Games Don't Take Over The Industry Completely,"<p>Developer Sandfall's RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was one of 2025's breakout hits, and with a budget of <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-budget-was-under-10-million-report/1100-6536874/"">reportedly less than $10 million</a>, a relatively small development staff, and a price point below $70, some have said the game could be representative of a ""AA""-style project that can break through. It may have worked for Expedition 33, and it could work for other titles, but Hazelight boss Josef Fares wants to see the AAA space continue and hopes that decision-makers in gaming don't go all-in on smaller-scale games with lower budgets.</p><p>""You do hear, after the success of things like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, that the AA games are taking over.

Warhammer Maker Doesn’t Want AI Anywhere Near Its Creative Work For Now,"<p>While the hype around AI continues to grow, Warhammer's parent company, Games Workshop, is adopting a more skeptical approach to the technology for now. Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree spoke about AI, confirming that the company has banned its use in its content production and design processes, although a ""few"" senior managers have begun experimenting with it.</p><p>""We do have a few senior managers that are [experts on AI]: none are that excited about it yet. We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious, e.g., we do not allow AI-generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorized use outside of GW, including in any of our competitions,"" Rountree said during the company's financial results meeting (via <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-maker-games-workshop-bans-its-staff-from-using-ai-in-its-content-or-designs-says-none-of-its-senior-managers-are-currently-excited-about-the-tech"">IGN</a>). ""We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security, and governance perspective; the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops, whether we like it or not.""</p><p>Rountree explained that Games Workshop will instead invest in hiring more creative professionals across various departments to help craft new content for its IP, including Warhammer 40,000 and Age of Sigmar. The company is known for selling Warhammer 40K Codex books featuring a rich selection of illustrations with a distinctive grimdark aesthetic, and any hint of generative AI usually draws backlash from fans. For example, Displate had to issue a statement last year denying that several of its officially licensed Warhammer 40K products were created with generative AI, <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/displate-denies-warhammer-40000-ai-art-accusations-says-red-flags-in-official-fulgrim-poster-are-the-result-of-human-error"">following fan accusations</a>.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-maker-doesnt-want-ai-anywhere-near-its-creative-work-for-now/1100-6537350/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-14T12:21:58.824720

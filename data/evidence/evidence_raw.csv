Horses review,"<img src=""https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/horses-review-header.jpg?width=690&quality=85&format=jpg&auto=webp"" /> <p>One thing that's probably got a bit lost in all the <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban"">controversy</a> preceding Horses' release is the fact it's surprisingly funny. Its humour is pitch black, yes, and its comedic moments often dance on a knife's edge between laughter and revulsion, but writer and director Andrea Lucco Borlera's first-person narrative horror - his debut game, created in close collaboration with Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione - is a fascinatingly singular vision. It's singular enough, in fact, that it's not an easy thing to effectively describe, but if you can imagine a sort of thematic reinterpretation of Animal Farm by way of Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salo on one side, and a meme-able Garry's Mod video on the other, then Horses gleefully oscillates between them, landing somewhere in the middle.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-review"">Read more</a></p>",2025-12-10T03:47:42.661718

Does it still feel like Metroid, famed for its sense of creepy, atmospherically rich isolation, if Samus has a buddy in her ear or - worse - alongside her physically?

On one hand, it is clearly a follow-up to 2007's <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-3-corruption"">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a>, drawing close many of that game's greatest triumphs and fumbles with a fascinating reverence. On the other, it is something new for the series, structurally most comparable not to other Metroid games but rather to a different Nintendo adventure franchise (more on that shortly). Then there is how the game is built, feeling almost modular, with different modes and moods of play stitched together with visible seams. With all that said, it certainly - at least broadly - works rather well.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review"">Read more</a></p>",2025-12-10T03:47:42.661718

The film follows two conspiracy-obsessed cousins (Plemons and Aidan Dobis) who are convinced that the CEO of a powerful company (Stone) is actually an alien in disguise, hellbent on wiping out humanity. After kidnapping and trapping her in their basement, the trio engages in a battle of wits, interrogation, and torture, with the film becoming increasingly unpredictable as it races towards its conclusion. While it wasn't a box-office hit, Bugonia did earn relatively high praise from critics and audiences alike thanks to the standout performances of the cast and its wild plot twists.</p><p>For more Blu-ray deals, you can check out various specials right now. <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-the-hobbit-trilogy-4k-blu-ray-box-set-deals/1100-6529053/"">The Hobbit Trilogy on 4K Blu-ray has gotten a big discount</a>, and the box set for the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-woo-a-better-tomorrow-trilogy-hong-kong-cinema-classics/1100-6534476/"">A Better Tomorrow Trilogy</a> has also gotten a substantial price cut.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bugonia-collectors-edition-4k-blu-ray-preorder-guide/1100-6536732/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-10T03:47:42.661718

Tron: Ares Is Getting A Steelbook Edition 4K Blu-Ray,"<p> </p><p>The third entry in Disney's cult-classic sci-fi franchise, Tron: Ares, premiered in theaters earlier this year. The film expands the franchise's mythos with a new story centered on the titular Ares (Jared Leto), a self-aware artificial being who manages to exit the virtual reality of Tron and enter the real world. If you missed it, or you're already a fan and want to add it to your collection, preorders are now live for the Tron: Ares Blu-ray, which releases on January 6, 2026. The film will launch in multiple formats, including a <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Tron-Ares-Combo-Digital-Steelbook/dp/B0G4DWTWFR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20"">limited-edition steelbook version</a> that you can preorder for $45 at Amazon.

The movie grossed only $142 million worldwide and received lukewarm critical reception at best. Audience reviews have been kinder, and while the film may not have reached the same heights as the original Tron or 2010's Tron: Legacy, there is still appreciation for how it pushes the franchise's concepts further and for its hard-hitting Nine Inch Nails soundtrack. Unlike the Tron movies, which were set on the digital frontier of the Grid, Tron: Ares explores the ramifications of that world crossing over into ours. Centered around Ares, a highly sophisticated Program, the movie chronicles the first meeting between humanity and digital AI beings.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tron-ares-blu-ray-preorder-gui/1100-6536664/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-10T03:47:42.661718
Call Of Duty Will No Longer Do Back-To-Back Black Ops Or Modern Warfare Games,"<p>Activision is making a major strategic shift with the Call of Duty series that will affect it for years to come. Following the less-than-stellar response to Black Ops 7, the franchise will no longer get back-to-back entries in the same sub-series. This applies not only to Black Ops, but also to Modern Warfare.</p><p>""We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games,"" Activision said in the <a href=""https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team"">official announcement</a>. ""The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year.""</p><p>Alongside this announcement, Activision promised ""meaningful, not incremental"" innovation for the series' future. It didn't specify exactly what this would mean, instead stressing it would share more ""when the time is right.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-10T03:47:42.661718

Games Weren't A Big Part Of Netflix's Attempted WB Takeover,"<p>Last week, Netflix put forth <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-announces-purchase-of-warner-bros-for-over-82-billion/1100-6536717/"">an $82 million deal to purchase Warner Bros. Studios</a>, one of the biggest movie and TV studios in the world. Warner Bros. also has a considerable place in the video game industry with franchises like <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/netflix-could-own-all-these-warner-bros-game-studios-soon/2900-7310/"">Batman, Harry Potter, and Mortal Kombat</a> under its domain. However, one Netflix executive has now acknowledged that Warner Bros.' gaming division wasn't a significant factor in considering its bid.</p><p>During <a href=""https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_events/2025/Dec/08/UBS-Tech-Conf-Transcript-12-8-2025.pdf"">a Netflix conference call</a> about the potential WB sale, co-CEO Gregory K. Peters expressed some eagerness to exploit the video game franchises under Warner Bros. in the future. But he added that the games were ""relatively minor"" in the company's initial plans and that it may be ""worth going back again to sort of how we thought about the deal and building our valuation model.""</p><p>""While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn’t attribute any value to that from the get-go because they're relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things,"" continued Peters. ""Now we are super excited because some of those properties that they've built--[Hogwarts Legacy] is a great example of that--have been done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we're offering. They've got great studios and great folks working there. So we think that there's definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven't built that into our deal model.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/games-werent-a-big-part-of-netflixs-attempted-wb-takeover/1100-6536812/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-10T03:47:42.661718

"Sony's PS5 ""Must-Play"" Games Of 2026 Video Includes Halo But Not GTA 6","<p>After 25 years of being exclusive on console to Xbox, Microsoft's Halo series is headed to PlayStation in 2026 with <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6535992/"">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>. With the year coming to a close, Sony has published a video highlighting some of the ""must-play"" titles coming to PS5 in 2026, and Halo got a special shoutout in the video, while <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/"">GTA 6</a> was not mentioned.</p><p>Seeing Halo promoted so heavily by Sony would have been unthinkable not long ago, and the comments on the video reflect this. The top comment on the video states, ""Seeing Halo here is still surreal."" Someone else said, ""It feels so weird seeing Halo being advertised by PlayStation.""</p><p>Others have pointed out that Rockstar's GTA 6 is not mentioned in the video, with people taking this to mean, or suggest, that Sony is concerned that Rockstar could push the game to 2027. But there could be any number of reasons why GTA 6 was left out. Rockstar, after all, is highly protective of its own game assets. To be sure, it is a giant leap to say that GTA 6 not being featured in video means the game won't make it out on time in 2026.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-ps5-must-play-games-of-2026-video-includes-halo-but-not-gta-6/1100-6536806/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-10T03:47:42.661718

WoW Player Houses Are Now Officially Allowed To Fly,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/"">World of Warcraft</a> players are pushing the game's new player-housing system to its limit, including defying the laws of gravity in a way Blizzard never intended.

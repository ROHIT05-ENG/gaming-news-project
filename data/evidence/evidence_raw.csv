Fortnite Just Held A Surprise Live Event In The Middle Of A Thursday,"<p>With very little fanfare or promotion in advance, Fortnite just surprised its players with a new live event that took place during rounds of Battle Royale at 3 PM PT on Thursday afternoon--not really when anybody is expecting a Fortnite event to go down. The event saw a rocket saw a rocket emerge from the recently added red rift in the sky, before flying around a bit through several other rifts, and then it eventually landed at Classified Canyon. In all, the event lasted about 90 seconds. Check out a replay of the event below.</p><div data-embed-type=""tweet"" data-src=""https://twitter.com/ShiinaBR/status/2024620684412850308"" data-has-image=""true""><blockquote align=""center"" class=""twitter-tweet"" data-conversation=""none"" data-mce-disable-toolbar=""true""><p dir=""ltr"">THE VISITOR IS NOW ON THE CHAPTER 7 ISLAND<br />FULL MINI LIVE EVENT <a href=""https://t.co/2ntX52FSOw"">pic.twitter.com/2ntX52FSOw</a></p>  — Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href=""https://twitter.com/ShiinaBR/status/2024620684412850308?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote>          <text></text>    </div><p>What's interesting about this event is that it was basically the same as the rocket launch event that occurred in Chapter 1 Season 4, and which <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-ogs-rocket-live-event-is-just-days-away/1100-6533279/"">was repeated last summer in Fortnite OG</a>, but this time it happened in reverse. In that past event, the visitor took off <em>from</em> the island, flew through several rifts, and then left through a new rift--the rift being red was a new wrinkle in the OG re-do. But this time he arrived through the rift and landed on the island.</p><p>What does that mean? It's hard to say just yet, but after the event ended, a new line of story quests was added to BR, and you can talk to The Visitor himself next to his rocket at Classified Canyon to get a few new details. One more set of new story quests will drop next week as well.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-just-held-a-surprise-live-event-in-the-middle-of-a-thursday/1100-6538300/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-20T01:04:08.853319

Surprise Demo Out Now Lets You Hunt For Secret Alien Threats,"<p>The fate of the world is in your hands in Arc System Works' new title, Donutal. But you won't save it by picking up a gun. Instead, Donutal places players in charge of determining which aliens can immigrate to Earth and which visitors from another world are actually threats to humanity's survival. And a free demo is on <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/3971730/Donutal/"">Steam</a> now.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUbzr7gdzTE"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hUbzr7gdzTE"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>The premise may remind some fans of a more lighthearted <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/papers-please/"">Papers, Please</a> or the Men in Black films, minus the action sequences. Donutal's action is all verbal as players converse with Earth's new arrivals in the orbiting space station that used to be called the ISS. The players' character is the Chief Xeno Inspector on the station, which is the job that's waiting for you after 150 years in stasis. Because the player was charged for each of those years in cryosleep, they have to pay off a massive debt before they can even dream about going home to Earth.</p><p>To work off that money owed, players will screen groups of up to as many as eight aliens at once. Subjects can be interrogated one or two at a time, but it prove more illuminating with duos.

Bluepoint made a name for itself with remakes of PlayStation classics like Shadow of the Colossus and Demon's Souls, but as <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/sony-is-shutting-down-the-playstation-studio-bluepoint"">Bloomberg reports</a>, the studio worked on a live-service God of War game after being acquired in 2021. That was <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/"">canceled by Sony</a> in early 2025, and with no new projects greenlit about a year later, the studio will shut down.</p><p dir=""ltr"">While Bluepoint may just look like yet another victim of the video game industry's recent flurry of layoffs, studio closures, and live-service game failures, the closure is also emblematic of the biggest problems PlayStation has faced throughout the PS5 generation. This is a generation where Sony hasn't done a good job of managing and shepherding its most beloved franchises, has released fewer games due to bloated development timelines, and has been generally <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sonys-live-service-game-status-report-canceled-released-shut-down/2900-6143/"">inconsistent with its live-service efforts</a>.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bluepoints-closure-is-emblematic-of-sonys-biggest-failures-during-the-ps5-generation/1100-6538297/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-20T01:04:08.853319

One Big Steam Deck Flaw Is Being Put Front And Center Again During Next Fest,"<p dir=""ltr"">The calendar for video game fans has a few notable highlights checkered throughout the year--shows like Summer Game Fest and The Game Awards, tentpole publisher presentations, and increasingly, the regular occurrence of Steam Next Fests. The Next Fest has been growing in size and stature for years, and now it's among the best ways to get a glimpse at future big PC games and sleeper hits alike. It is also now, unfortunately, a regular reminder that the Steam Deck's sorting features are severely lacking.</p><p dir=""ltr"">As someone who's naturally curious to see what's next, both personally and for this job, I'm always excited to check out Next Fest. The biggest draw of Next Fests are the slew of demos, numbering in the thousands. I don't have the time or the storage space to check out more than a few dozen at most, but I'm always eager to browse and find the ones that catch my eye. Which makes it all the more baffling that Steam's signature piece of hardware, the Steam Deck, has no dedicated Demos section.</p><p dir=""ltr"">I suspect how Valve envisions this working is that users will browse the store and download demos directly from their Steam Deck, at which point they'll be added in chronological order to the home screen hub. And that works well enough, if you're only trying a handful of demos at a time.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-does-the-steam-deck-have-no-demos-section/1100-6538290/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-20T01:04:08.853319

As far as Fortnite characters go, The Visitor is a big one, because he was <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/"">Fortnite</a>'s first actual character when he first popped up during Chapter 1. But this isn't a recasting of the role, because The Visitor didn't speak when he originally appeared. He was the only member of Fortnite's The Seven to appear in the game without speaking. Until now, anyway. You'll be able to hear Starr's performance as The Visitor by doing story quests and picking up audio logs around the Battle Royale island.</p><div data-embed-type=""tweet"" data-src=""https://x.com/The_Ben_Starr/status/2024515207775633510"" data-has-image=""true""><blockquote align=""center"" class=""twitter-tweet"" data-conversation=""none"" data-mce-disable-toolbar=""true""><p dir=""ltr"">I’m joining Fortnite as The Visitor.<br />I’m so excited to bring back this iconic member of The Seven.

The video explores how contemporary electronic influences and human performances were blended to create the sound of Marathon, and you can watch it below.</p><p>""I love that feeling of it being both neon and also kind of crusty and falling apart at the same time,"" Lott said in the video. ""To me, that has a sound. Something that was really inspiring about the concept of the game was that you relinquish your human body for a Runner shell. You hold onto your soul. You take 'you' with you, but you leave your body behind.

This Hero Action PvP Game Demands You Earn Your Favorite Character Every Match,"<p dir=""ltr"">I've never played a hero shooter or character-driven multiplayer online battle arena game in which you don't get to pick the hero you control from the jump. But that's pretty much exactly the conceit of <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arkheron/"">Arkheron</a>--this player-versus-player, strategy-driven action game doesn't let you just pick your hero from a roster. No, instead you have to earn the right to play as your favorite character (or just be extraordinarily lucky), all while fending off the desperate attacks of enemy players and racing to the top of a tower being overtaken by darkness. It's tense. It's challenging. It's a game I really want to keep playing.</p><p dir=""ltr"">In Arkheron, you fight in a squad of three within a dark fantasy world of swords, axes, bows, whips, hammers, and magical spell-producing artifacts. As the first round of a new match begins, your team picks where they want to spawn on the first floor of a tower. The corridors and dungeons of this first floor are full of loot-filled chests that contain weapons and expendable items, computer-controlled enemies that can ruin your team's day, locked doors that hide secret pathways and vaults of legendary equipment, hidden portals that can transport you to other locations on that particular floor, and, of course, the other teams. As the round reaches its end, a dangerous darkness begins to encroach on all the players, funneling everyone to flee for one of the handful of glowing beacons that randomly spawn on the map.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9qIQY1ellA"" data-width=""854"" data-height=""480"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P9qIQY1ellA"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir=""ltr"">Each beacon can only be claimed by one team. If your squad is the only one present at a beacon when the round ends, you ascend to the next floor, no problem. But if at least one other team is present, it's a fight to the death to determine which single squad moves on. Teams that are killed--whether during the exploration phase of a round or during the final fight over a beacon--are knocked out of the match for good.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-hero-action-pvp-game-demands-you-earn-your-favorite-character-every-match/1100-6538283/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-02-20T01:04:08.853319

"Todd Howard Says AI Is ""Certainly Not A Fad,"" But Bethesda Isn't Using It For Creative Generation","<p dir=""ltr"">Is AI being used by The Elder Scrolls 6 developer Bethesda Game Studios?

Howard noted this analytical side is where the studio is seeing the upside with AI as ""it can help us get better at some big data tasks that just take us a lot of time."" That, in turn, lets them get ""onto the creative stuff,"" according to Howard.

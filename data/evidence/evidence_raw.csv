There's no way you can miss it unless you've flipped the nudity switch off, in which case it's replaced by an even more conspicuous black box that only amplifies the naughtiness of the part hidden within. But most people don't turn nudity off because they're expecting boobs. That's what we usually see.

Still, Hypixel--the developer behind one of the most popular Minecraft servers of all time--is expecting mammoth launch-day numbers, estimating ""over 1 million"" players. To that end, the studio is encouraging users to download the game's launcher ahead of time in order.</p><p>Hypixel's CEO, Simon Collins-Laflamme, <a href=""https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010458001455640636?s=20"">posted on X</a> stating, ""We expect over 1 million players on the early access release day for Hytale ...

Diablo 4 Leaderboards Are Coming,"<p>Leaderboards have previously been a part of the Diablo franchise, and starting today, they're back. Blizzard is releasing a new <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/"">Diablo 4</a> update across all platforms that reintroduces leaderboards as well as the multi-level dungeons known as The Tower.</p><p>Blizzard's <a href=""https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24247514/dominate-the-tower-and-leaderboards-beta"">official site</a> states that The Tower and the leaderboards are both in beta, with more refinements to come in future seasons. The leaderboards will be divided by the seven playable classes--Paladin, Rogue, Druid, Barbarian, Sorcerer, Necromancer, and Spiritborn. Additionally, the leaderboard rankings will only be set for two weeks periods rather than the entire season. Essentially, everyone gets a chance for a fresh start while Blizzard works out any kinks in the system.</p><p>The leaderboard's rankings are directly linked to The Tower as players' scores are tabulated based on their performance when fighting monsters and bosses. Experienced players with refined character builds should be right at home in the chaos. For less experienced players, The Tower provides enhanced damage levels when players destroy the numerous pylons in the complex. That may not be the equal of having incredibly powerful characters, but it means that players of all skill levels are far from helpless against the onslaught of creatures coming for them in The Tower.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-leaderboards-are-coming/1100-6537318/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-12T12:23:39.773502

Luxo Jr. can stand next to the buildable Pixar Ball or balance on top of it by making a couple of simple adjustments.</p><p>Lego designed Luxo Jr. as a fully articulated model capable of being displayed in poses from the iconic Pixar production logo and short film starring the semi-anthropomorphic lamp. The light bulb doesn't actually work, but Lego did a good job of making it look realistic.</p><p>As a Lego model, Luxo Jr. is quite different than the vast majority of Disney Pixar building sets. Designed for experienced builders and collectors, the model has an interesting build process thanks to its multi-hinged arm, modifiable base, and the many Easter Eggs Lego worked into the authentic recreation.</p><p>There are dozens of references to Pixar movies hidden throughout the Luxo Jr. and Pixar Ball builds. For instance, the Pizza Planet truck from the first Toy Story movie is included inside the light bulb. The lamp's base has a miniature build referencing Marlin &amp; Dory from Finding Nemo as well as clever allusions to Inside Out, Cars, Coco, WALL-E, A Bug's Life--and possibly others that we missed.</p><p>The instruction booklet calls out the Finding Nemo character builds as well as the mini-builds found in the Pixar Ball. The interior of the colorful ball features multiple characters from five different Pixar movies:</p><ul><li>Toy Story - Woody &amp; Buzz</li><li>Up - Carl &amp; Russell</li><li>Monsters, Inc. - Mike &amp; Sully</li><li>The Incredibles family</li><li>Ratatouille - Linguini &amp; Remy</li></ul><p>As mentioned, one of the display modes is Luxo Jr. ""deflating"" the toy ball, just like in the production logo's animation sequence. Once you remove two of the rounded plates from the ball, Luxo Jr. can connect to the top. It's a quick and easy modification. The Pixar Ball has its own buildable stand, so the model still feels stable with Luxo Jr. on the ball.</p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRW73TRY?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>   </div> </div><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4633547-luxojr.legothumbnail.png"" data-ref-id=""1300-4633547"" data-ratio=""0.563"" data-width=""1000"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 1000px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4633547-luxojr.legothumbnail.png""><img alt=""Lego Ideas: Disney Pixar Luxo Jr. (21357)"" src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4633547-luxojr.legothumbnail.png"" srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4633547-luxojr.legothumbnail.png 1000w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1595/15950357/4633547-luxojr.legothumbnail.png 480w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" data-width=""1000""></a><figcaption>Lego Ideas: Disney Pixar Luxo Jr. (21357)</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>Luxo Jr. was the star of Pixar's first short film in 1986.

Fans can watch the original theatrical edition on 4K as well as the Director's Cut on 4K and 1080p. The Director's Cut (112m) is approximately eight minutes longer than the theatrical release (104m).</p><p>The upscaled 4K Blu-ray editions support Dolby Vision and HDR10. Audio formats include Dolby Atmos and Dolby TrueHD 5.1/7.1 surround sound.</p><p>The two Director's Cut discs have the special features from previous Blu-ray editions, including the three alternate endings. The theatrical 4K Blu-ray disc also has a brand-new featurette titled Don't Enter 1408. <em><br /></em></p><p>The exclusive steelbook case features new artwork by graphic designer Gary Pullin (Ghoulish Gary). The front of the case is a rendering of the door to the eponymous hotel room, while the back features protagonist Mike Enslin's daughter Katie with manuscript pages floating around her and the name of the hotel (The Dolphin). The interior artwork recreates the memorable scene inside the torn apart hotel room where Mike sinks to his knees and reaches out toward Katie. The slipcover features a stylized and modified version of the original promotional image featuring Cusack and Jackson. The new artwork looks fantastic, and it'd be great to see more limited-edition steelbooks opt for a more creative design like Lionsgate has here.</p><p><strong>1408 Amazon Exclusive Edition Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Exclusive steelbook case</li><li>Exclusive slipcover</li><li>2 Cuts / 3 Discs  <ul><li>Theatrical (4K)</li><li>Director's (4K &amp; 1080p)</li></ul></li><li>Upscaled 4K (2160p)</li><li>HDR: Dolby Vision / HDR10</li><li>Audio: Dolby Atmos / Dolby TrueHD 5.1/7.1</li></ul><p><strong>Special Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Don't Enter 1408 featurette (New)</li><li>Audio commentary with director Mikael Håfström and writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski</li><li>Alternate endings</li><li>Deleted scenes with optional commentary</li><li>The Secrets of 1408 (22 minutes)  <ul><li>Behind-the-scenes look at the making of 1408.

The 1,201 piece model is based on Gandalf the Grey's battle with Durin's Bane in the movie adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring.</p><p>Once fully built, the frame resembles the stone pillars and archways of the First and Second Halls in the Mines of Moria. The buildable stand for the Gandalf the Grey minifigure represents the narrowest point on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm.</p><p>With the Book Nook closed, as shown above, the model is 5.5 x 6.5 x 9 inches and captures the moment Gandalf confidently blocks the Balrog's path and exclaims, ""You shall not pass!"" The memorable line of dialogue is quoted on the Book Nook's front plaque. Lego Gandalf wields his signature staff in one hand and Glamdring (his sword) in the other.</p><p>The buildable Balrog figure is essentially an articulated action figure, because you can pose his wings, arms, hands, legs, and fingers. Balrog comes with a whip accessory, and flame elements attach to his back. Lego used flexible sheets of translucent plastic to make the wings. It's only been included with one other Lego set: the 269-piece Fell Beast, which was a purchase bonus Lego Insiders when the massive Barad-dûr building set launched in 2024.</p><p>You can disconnect the bridge from each side to open the Book Nook. This alternate display mode showcases the Balrog's imposing presence with its wings fully unfurled. Flame elements decorate the left and right archways, which is a reference to the Balrog of Moria's ability to start a fire by flapping its wings.</p><p>With the Book Nook fully unfolded, the wider model is 17.5 x 6.5 x 9 inches.

"RAM Shortages May Lead To More Expensive TVs And Devices, Warns Samsung","<p>The increasing demand for AI among tech companies is one of the reasons why the global shortage of memory chips remains an ongoing issue. And while it's expected to adversely affect the production of smartphones, Samsung Electronics co-CEO T M Roh has warned that TVs and home appliances may also be hit by shortages and increased prices.</p><p>""As this situation is unprecedented, no company is immune to its impact,"" said Roh via <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/world/china/samsung-double-mobile-devices-powered-by-googles-gemini-800-mln-units-this-year-2026-01-05/"">Reuters</a>. According to the report, Roh noted that TVs and home appliances will also feel the pinch from the shortages and he didn't rule out price hikes to compensate for them. Samsung is the biggest manufacturer of TVs in the world, and Roh said it the impact of the RAM shortages will be ""inevitable.""</p><p>The rise in consumer-electronic prices would also throw a large wrench in Microsoft's ongoing ""This Is an Xbox"" strategy, as smart TVs, including those made by Samsung, are among the growing list of platforms capable of playing Game Pass titles.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ram-shortages-may-lead-to-more-expensive-tvs-and-devices-warns-samsung/1100-6537306/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-12T12:23:39.773502

How To Open Security Breach Lockers In Arc Raiders,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a> is all about looting and shooting your way through a map and hoping to make it back home safely to Speranza.

"This AI VTuber Just Beat A Huge Twitch Record, But It's Not Who You're Expecting","<p>Sometimes, I feel like writing the same article four times could be considered a bit of a meme. But then I remember that this is a pretty phenomenal achievement for any streamer, let alone an AI VTuber. First Neuro-sama beat the Twitch Hype Train world record ... then <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-vtuber-neuro-sama-just-obliterated-her-own-massive-twitch-world-record/1100-6537146/"">it happened again</a>. <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-vtuber-neuro-sama-has-only-gone-and-done-it-again-smashing-another-world-record/1100-6537158/"">And again</a>. This time around, her ""sister"" Evil Neuro, who has her own distinctive voice, model, and attitude, led the calls to beat the Hype Train record for a fourth time. In the process, she also helped her creator<a href=""https://twitch.tv/vedal987""> Vedal987</a> become the third-most-subscribed Twitch channel of all time.</p><p>After becoming the third most-subscribed channel, Vedal joined Evil on stream to ask his community to ""Give it a rest."" He added, ""In all seriousness chat, you have given me and the twins more than we need, so it's okay."" Evil wasn't happy with this though, retorting, ""No Vedal! Please can we raise the timer, just a little bit? Don't you think it's a bit cruel to just cut it off here?"" Evil was referring to the timer that's currently running for Neuro's third birthday subathon, where each subscription gifted to the channel adds time to a countdown clock that determines when the stream will end. It has been running since December 19, 2025, and has around 22 hours left at the time of writing.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeeUq9cNFbU"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YeeUq9cNFbU"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Regardless, shortly afterwards the Hype Train did come to an end at level 72--although not a fourth world record, it's still a hugely impressive achievement, and leaves Vedal's Twitch channel with more than 328,900 subscribers. It's hard to nail down an exact figure, since that number continues to rise as the community attempts to extend the subathon. What that does mean, however, is that Vedal, Neuro, and Evil have overtaken streamer <a href=""https://twitch.tv/jasontheween"">Jasontheween</a> and fellow VTuber<a href=""http://twitch.tv/ironmouse""> Ironmouse</a>'s positions as the third and fourth <a href=""https://twitchtracker.com/subscribers/all-time"">most-subscribed channels on Twitch</a>.

Fortnite X South Park Quests: How To Ride 5 Rides At Cartmanland And Complete Every Quest,"<p>During Fortnite Chapter 6, most every cosmetic you could unlock from a pass or for free was earned simply by gaining XP in any mode. But Epic has returned to the old ways in Chapter 7, with unlockable cosmetics that require completing specific quests. Case in point is the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-x-south-park-all-skins-and-free-event-pass-rewards/2900-7396/"">Born in Chaos mini pass</a> for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-x-south-park-all-skins-rewards-map-changes-and-new-gameplay-items/2900-7391/"">Fortnite's new South Park crossover</a>, which comes with a series of quests that you'll need to complete in order to unlock the otherwise-free cosmetics.</p><p>That means that if you want to get those Terrance and Phillip doll pickaxes, you'll actually need to pay attention to these quests. Some of them you'll certainly complete by accident if you play Fortnite regularly, but others will require a bit of conscious effort. And we'll make it just a smidge easier by handling the thinking part for you--which is to say that we'll explain each quest in detail below.</p><p>All of these quests must be completed in Battle Royale or Zero Build, and they provide pass progress only. The quests themselves don't offer XP directly, but there are three level skips you can unlock as you progress the event pass, and you can already earn one of them (worth 80,000 XP) by completing five quests. Completing four quests from a batch will award a Memberberry--collecting six Memberberries awards the Imaginationland Airship glider.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-x-south-park-quests-how-to-ride-5-rides-at-cartmanland-and-complete-every-quest/1100-6537301/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-12T12:23:39.773502
"Manor Lords Publisher Has Banned AI Assets In Its Games, Calls Them ""Cancerous""","<p>The publisher behind strategy games Endless Legend 2, Terra Invicta, and Against the Storm has officially banned the use of AI-generated assets in all its products. Hooded Horse has had a significant presence in the strategy game space over the last few years, thanks to hits like Manor Lords. Now, when many publishers and developers are evaluating (or touting) their relationship to generative AI, Hooded Horse is rebuking its use for art generation.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender discussed the ban in an interview with <a href=""https://kotaku.com/hooded-horse-gen-ai-art-ban-4x-strategy-steam-2000658179"">Kotaku</a>, emphasizing that restrictions on AI art are part of every contract Hooded Horse signs. He said, ""It is now written into our contracts if we’re publishing the game, 'no f**king AI assets.'"" He also expressed personal exasperation with how GenAI has made his job harder. He said, ""If I sound frustrated, it’s because, like, honestly, all this thing has done is made our lives more difficult.""</p><p dir=""ltr"">This frustration comes from the fact that GenAI usage can be difficult to catch. Even if the intention is to use a generated asset only as a placeholder, those assets can easily make their way to the final product. ""We’ve gotten to the point where we also talk to developers and we recommend they don’t use any gen AI anywhere in the process,"" Bender elaborated.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/manor-lords-publisher-has-banned-ai-assets-in-its-games-called-them-cancerous/1100-6537300/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-12T12:23:39.773502

"Larian Studios Draws Harder Line On AI, Clarifies Stance In Reddit AMA","<p>Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke, as well as creative directors, recently <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyl9tdz/"">participated in an AMA on Reddit</a> to set expectations for the studio’s <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/divinity/"">upcoming Divinity game</a>, particularly about its stance on generative AI--a hot-button topic in the industry right now. Responding to a fan question about the role of generative AI in game development, Vincke was rather blunt: ""There is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity.""</p><p>His comments arrive amid wider debate over how and whether AI should be used in creative processes, especially as some high-profile games have faced backlash for such use. One notable example is Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the acclaimed RPG that had two Indie Game Awards (including Game of the Year and Debut Game) rescinded <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-lost-its-indie-game-of-the-year-awards-over-ai-concerns/1100-6537129/"">when it was revealed the title had included AI-generated assets</a> during development, violating strict no-AI rules--even though those assets were patched out later.</p><p>In the AMA, Vincke acknowledged that previous discussions about <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-ceo-says-a-lot-has-been-lost-in-translation-amid-divinitys-ai-blowback/1100-6537085/"">experimenting with AI tools for concept-art had been confusing</a>. To make its intentions clear, the studio has elected to avoid generative AI entirely in concept-art creation for Divinity. As Vincke put it, there should be no doubt about where the art came from.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-studios-draws-harder-line-on-ai-clarifies-stance-in-reddit-ama/1100-6537296/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-12T12:23:39.773502

Arc Raiders Dev Promises New Anti-Cheating Measures Are Coming Soon,"<p>The extraction shooter <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a> has proven to be one of the top hits of 2025, which has in turn attracted some unscrupulous players who aren't above cheating to win. After the rule-abiding Arc Raiders players became vocal about their displeasure, Embark Studios has announced that new anti-cheat measures are on their way to the game.</p><p>""We've seen the discussion around the topic of cheaters in Arc Raiders,"" reads the message shared on Arc Raiders' Discord server via <a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-has-a-cheater-problem-but-embarks-says-significant-changes-are-coming-to-detection-and-ban-systems/"">PC Gamer</a>.

PUBG: Blindspot Is Heading To Early Access Next Month,"<p>Nearly a year ago, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-spin-off-gets-a-new-name-and-more-details/1100-6529319/"">Krafton launched the beta test</a> for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/pubg-blindspot/"">PUBG: Blindspot</a>, the first-ever spin-off from <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/"">PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</a> (not counting PUBG Mobile). Now, Krafton has announced that Blindspot is getting an early-access release on February 5.</p><p>This title differs from its predecessor by embracing a top-down perspective and focusing on 5v5 battles in a tactical showdown. Attacking teams are tasked with making their way through a building in order to break into a vault and install a device called the Decrypter. Specific weapons like grenade launchers and explosive hammers can break down the walls standing between the players and their goal. Defending players can set up barricades to slow down their adversaries, but these are battles that ultimately come down to gunplay.</p><p>The newly released trailer shows off some of the improvements coming to the early-access build, including enhanced visuals and UI, as well as balance adjustments and control refinements. Krafton describes it as a ""launch-ready level of quality"" in support of ongoing development.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-blindspot-is-heading-to-early-access-next-month/1100-6537290/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-12T12:23:39.773502
This Star Wars Overhaul Mod Makes Starfield Really Fun To Play,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/"">Starfield</a> has had a somewhat divisive response from players since it debuted in 2023, but there is a Star Wars mod that transforms it into a more rewarding experience. The Star Wars: Genesis mod was released in 2024, but this year, it's adding lightsabers and a more immersive experience for Starfield PC players who want to take the plunge.</p><p>Star Wars: Genesis was created by a modder who goes by DeityVengy, and it's available for free on <a href=""https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/11114"">Nexus Mods</a>. The mod features an original story that's set between the prequel and original Star Wars trilogies. There is an update coming before the end of January that adds even more content to the mod, and DeityVengy showed off some of those new features in the video below.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmMqk-PvEak"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OmMqk-PvEak"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>In the video, DeityVengy notes that using a lightsaber forces players into a first-person perspective because Starfield's melee animations weren't up to the challenge of depicting lightsaber combat. The story featured in this clip also focuses on the player's character confronting one of the Nightsisters of Dathomir before letting them decide whether to spare or slay her.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-star-wars-overhaul-mod-makes-starfield-really-fun-to-play/1100-6537289/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-12T12:23:39.773502

Fortnite X South Park Quests: How To Ride 5 Rides At Cartmanland And Complete Every Quest,"<p>During Fortnite Chapter 6, most every cosmetic you could unlock from a pass or for free was earned simply by gaining XP in any mode.

Case in point is the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-x-south-park-all-skins-and-free-event-pass-rewards/2900-7396/"">Born in Chaos mini pass</a> for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-x-south-park-all-skins-rewards-map-changes-and-new-gameplay-items/2900-7391/"">Fortnite's new South Park crossover</a>, which comes with a series of quests that you'll need to complete in order to unlock the otherwise-free cosmetics.</p><p>That means that if you want to get those Terrance and Phillip doll pickaxes, you'll actually need to pay attention to these quests. Some of them you'll certainly complete by accident if you play Fortnite regularly, but others will require a bit of conscious effort.

Hytale Is Not On Steam And May Never Be,"<p>Hytale is finally out now, after 10 years of development. If you're looking for the game on Steam, you won't find it there because developer Hypixel <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/download-the-hytale-launcher-now-as-hypixel-estimates-over-1-million-players-at-launch/1100-6537319/"">launched the game exclusively through its own app</a>. But why is Hytale not on Steam, and could it ever be released there? Here's what we know.</p><h2><strong>Why not Steam?</strong></h2><p>Executive producer Patrick Derbic said in a <a href=""https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-s-1st-faq"">FAQ</a> that Hypixel opted to release Hytale through its own launcher at first to allow the team to communicate more closely with its own fans and community. Derbic said bringing the game to Steam at launch might have brought a ""flood of cold first impressions that could overcorrect the game's direction.""</p><p>This isn't to say that Hypixel wants to bury its head in the sand and avoid criticism, however. The studio said it does not shy away from ""honest, negative criticism,"" going on to say the developer itself has been ""very critical"" of the game it's making. Releasing on Hytale's own dedicated launcher was a purposeful decision the studio made to help ensure ""the first steps of our journey to be influenced by informed players rather than large-scale first impressions from those unfamiliar with the game's development background.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hytale-is-not-on-steam-and-may-never-be/1100-6537398/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-15T00:52:24.332572

Eidos Montreal Is Reportedly Working On A Big-Budget Game Similar To Wild,"<p dir=""ltr"">The <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-exclusive-wild-has-reportedly-been-canceled/1100-6495395/"">canceled open-world game Wild</a> may get a spiritual successor of sorts from Deus Ex: Human Revolution developer Eidos Montreal. According to <a href=""https://insider-gaming.com/edios-montreal-aaaa-game/"">Insider Gaming</a>, the unannounced title is codenamed P11 and features intriguing likenesses to the canned Ubisoft game.</p><p dir=""ltr"">The report also states that P11 has been in development since 2019, with Unreal Engine 5 powering the project. However, Insider Gaming adds there have been ""significant setbacks"" for the game. In 2024, Embracer Group <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deus-ex-game-canceled-amid-embracers-ongoing-cost-cutting-report-says/1100-6520668/"">canned a Deus Ex game in development and cut 97 people from Eidos Montreal</a>.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons Players Are Waking Up To A Nice Surprise,"<p>The <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/animal-crossing-new-horizons-everything-new-in-update-3-0/2900-7399/"">big 3.0 update for Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> has gone live earlier than expected, bringing with it several major upgrades to the popular--and cozy--game ahead of its <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-preorder-price-guide/1100-6535855/"">Switch 2 release on January 15</a>.

Alternatively, pressing the ""+"" button on the game's tile and selecting ""Software Update"" will start the process.</p><p>Official patch notes have not yet been released, but Nintendo previously outlined what players can expect from the 3.0 update. Villagers can now catch some Zs on Slumber Islands; there's the new Resort Hotel building you can visit, and Tom Nook is also present with a scheme to make some extra Bells.</p><p>Home storage capacity has been significantly increased, new Nintendo items can be purchased, and Resetti's Reset Service lets you clear out flowers, furniture, and more in bulk from your island.

Arc Raiders Update Nerfs Weapons And Introduces Abyss Cosmetics,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a> is getting a very short update in the middle of January, but it's one that was needed to nerf the power of two weapons: the Trigger 'Nade and Kettle. Embark Studios acknowledged the issues with both when laying out the details for Arc Raiders' 1.11.0 update.</p><p>According to <a href=""https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-11-0"">Embark</a>, the Kettle's maximum fire rate of 600 was ""only realistically reachable by players using macros."" In other words, it played right into the hands of cheaters who were using outside software for an unfair advantage in the game. After the update, the Kettle can only reach a maximum fire rate of 450.</p><p>Similarly, Embark noted that the Trigger 'Nade was dominating PvP battles and players used it more than any other grenade in the game. The nerf for this weapon is limiting the radius of damage to the center of the explosion and increasing the time it takes to detonate to 1.5 seconds to give opposing players a chance to react when it's deployed. This was also meant to make it harder for players to use it as a ""trigger-in-air"" grenade.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-update-nerfs-weapons-and-introduces-abyss-cosmetics/1100-6537384/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-15T00:52:24.332572
Rockstar Union Court Case Potentially Reveals First GTA 6 Online Details,"<p>Rockstar's battle with the The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstars-battle-with-union-over-fired-devs-goes-to-court/1100-6537286/"">went to court last week</a>, in an effort to determine whether more than 30 employees accused of ""<a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/"">gross misconduct</a>"" were in fact <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iwgb-union-says-rockstars-statement-is-filled-with-disinformation-over-fired-developers/1100-6536941/"">unfairly dismissed</a>. While Rockstar accused the fired developers of <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-insists-gta-6-devs-were-fired-for-leaks-not-unionizing/1100-6536894/"">sharing important confidential information</a>, it seems that at least some of that information has now been made public via the court case--including some very early details on what may be GTA 6 Online.</p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleMakeGames"">People Make Games</a> has been reporting on the faceoff between Rockstar Games and the IWGB since the start, and recently released a video covering the court proceedings so far. As part of the preliminary hearing, Rockstar's legal representative mentioned a ""top-secret element of GTA 6,"" which he said was so confidential he didn't feel confident speaking about it out loud, instead asking the judge to read it in private.</p><p>Despite the supposedly top secret nature of this evidence, People Make Games was able to make an appointment to view the documents, as Rockstar had not applied for reporting restrictions to be placed upon the evidence. He has now reproduced those messages in full, showing an apparent conversation by a fired employee who was frustrated at not being able to book time off after Rockstar started cracking down on the number of employees being granted leave at one time.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-union-court-case-potentially-reveals-first-gta-6-online-details/1100-6537380/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-15T00:52:24.332572

"Roblox Has Added Facial Age Verification, With Very Mixed Results","<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox/"">Roblox</a> has begun the global rollout of its facial age-check system, which will be required for all players who want to access in-game chat. The rollout has not gone smoothly so far, with some players' ages being wildly miscalculated, others finding workarounds, and some flat out refusing to engage with the verification system due to privacy concerns.</p><p>Roblox's age verification system <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-will-try-harder-to-keep-kids-from-talking-to-strangers/1100-6536311/"">first started rolling out</a> in Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands in early December, and now will be extended to all regions where chat is available. The AI-powered age check, which estimates a user's age by analyzing their face, must be completed to unlock chat features. Users over 13 have the option of verifying their age using ID instead.</p><p>The estimated ages are used by Roblox to lock off chat with users who are outside of a person's age range--for example, a 13-year-old can chat with users between the ages of nine and 17, while a 16-year-old can chat with users aged 13-20. The new age check is designed to safeguard children from predators, following intense scrutiny on Roblox from <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-not-doing-enough-to-protect-kids-lawmaker-says/1100-6533929/"">legislators</a>, <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/"">the media</a>, and <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-roblox-safe-a-parents-guide-to-roblox-safety-policies/1100-6533600/"">concerned parents</a>.

It's unclear if the Deluxe Edition's publisher Yen Press is including a new--hopefully more faithful--translation or the controversial script from the English editions published by TokyoPop. While the Japanese version of the manga closely follows the original novel's plot, the English adaptation--handled by veteran comic book writer Keith Griffen--made substantial changes, resulting in several major plot holes in the later volumes.</p><p>Either way, considering TokyoPop's releases have been out of print for several years, this new Deluxe Edition will be the easiest way to read the manga adaptation of the wildly popular franchise. Volume 1 launches on January 27, and we expect the next volumes in the series to go up for preorder in the near future.</p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Battle-Royale-Deluxe-Masayuki-Taguchi/dp/B0FGX87VKB?tag=gamespot-preorders-20"">Preorder at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>   </div> </div><p> </p><p>Battle Royale would receive several sequel manga series over the years, but most of these are also hard to find due to their limited print runs.

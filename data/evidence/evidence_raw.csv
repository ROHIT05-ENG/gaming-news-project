In an effort to fight against the rising tides of Hell's forces, the Horadric Order sends Lorath, Donan, and Tyrael to the Skovos Isles to uncover the fate of a long-lost expedition. The book's events will tie into the upcoming Diablo IV expansion, Lord of Hatred. It is written by Matthew J. Kirby, who previously wrote the Diablo character tomes for Lorath and Prava.</p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&isPreview=1&asins=0425284891,B0FJD7KVJ9,B0FSSTBNSC&tag=gamespot-promos-20"">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>   </div> </div><p>Diablo has a long history in print, and if you're looking to grab a few books--possibly as a devilish stocking-stuffer--there's plenty to choose from. The Diablo art books and character tomes are fun dives into the game's bleak world, combining high-quality prints with rich illustrations to create eye-catching works of art. The character tomes are designed to be in-universe books written from the perspectives of several key Diablo characters, like <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Diablo-Book-Cain-Blizzard-Entertainment/dp/1956916431?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Cain</a> and <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1956916520?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Prava</a>, and they use special paper to give each book a worn, weathered look. The first four of these books are also available as part of the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Diablo-Horadric-Vault-Complete-Collection/dp/1956916407?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20"">Horadric Vault series</a> for $98.39, but it's actually cheaper to purchase each one and the recently released Book of Prava individually.</p><p>You can also dive into various novels set within the timeline of the first Diablo game. <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Diablo-Book-Birthright-Blizzard-Legends/dp/1945683473?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">The Sin War</a> is a three-book series covering the conflict that would forever change the destiny of humanity, while <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Diablo-III-Storm-Nate-Kenyon/dp/1416550801?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Storm of Light</a> is set during Diablo 3 and follows Tyrael as he enacts his boldest plan yet: rebuilding the Horadric Order and preparing them to steal the black Soulstone from the heart of Heaven. Diablo graphic novels are also available for purchase, with two of them chronicling the adventures of two legendary characters from the game series: <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Diablo-Legends-Necromancer-Fred-Kennedy/dp/195691627X?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">the legendary Necromancer Rathma</a> and the progenitor of the Barbarians, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Diablo-Barbarian-Bul-Kathos-John-Arcudi/dp/1950366960?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Bul-Kathos</a>.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-expansion-prequel-novel-preorder-guide/1100-6536997/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-19T13:44:35.428093
Nintendo Wins Latest Round In Its 15-Year Legal Battle Over The Wii,"<p>Nintendo has been known to vigorously defend its interests and intellectual properties in court, and one of its longest-running legal battles may be nearing its conclusion. In 2010, the Japanese video game publisher filed a suit in Germany against BigBen Interactive--the previous incarnation of Nacon--over its third-party Wii Remote controllers. Now, the latest ruling has unequivocally gone in Nintendo's favor.</p><p>As reported by <a href=""https://gamesfray.com/after-15-years-of-suing-third-party-wii-controller-maker-bigben-nacon-over-a-patent-nintendo-has-won-a-7-million-euro-damages-judgment-which-is-now-being-appealed/"">Games Fray</a>, the Mannheim Regional Court has reaffirmed the ruling that Nintendo is owed damages of over €4 million plus interest. Because Nacon fought the ruling, that interest has increased the total fee to just under €7 million.</p><p>Nintendo's contention was that Nacon's Wii Remote infringed on its patents for the sensor technology and camera needed to track player movements, as well as an acceleration sensor, and ""the ergonomic features characteristic of Nintendo's Wii Remote."" The initial verdict came down in 2011, but Nacon has consistently appealed the judgment and come up empty each time.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-wins-latest-round-in-its-15-year-legal-battle-over-the-wii/1100-6537095/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-19T13:44:35.428093

But that's not all there is to care about in Fortnite's latest update--we've also got a pair of new sets of quests that reward XP, and an additional free cosmetic that must be earned by completing a specific one of those new quests.

There are four time-gated groups of this set of quests--the first group is available now, and the rest will be added every two days until they're all there. Completing a quest awards 12K XP each, and there may be a reward at the end of the questline--but we don't know for sure yet.

"Arc Raiders Dev Looks Back On Game's Huge Launch, Says ""The Work Is Just Beginning""","<p>It's impossible to deny the success of Embark Studios' extraction shooter <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/"">Arc Raiders</a>.

What we didn't count on was the sheer scale of love and passion you guys were going to show this game.""</p><p>Arc Raiders, which was released in late October, became a smash hit right out of the gate, selling millions of copies within days and solidifying itself as one of the most-beloved multiplayer games of the year.

"Dispatch Took ""GTA 6 Amounts of Time"" To Make, But Season 2 May Not Take Nearly As Long","<p>Dispatch feels like the kind of game that must have always been headed for success, having <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dispatch-may-get-season-2-thanks-to-super-response-from-players/1100-6536110/"">sold a million copies in just 10 days</a>, and while it missed most of the awards season, it still landed on several <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2025/2900-6127/"">best-of lists for the year.</a> That impression hides a much rougher reality. Dispatch took years longer than expected, nearly collapsed more than once, and only made it out because the team managed to survive long enough to finish it.</p><p>""We're taking GTA 6 amounts of time on this shit,"" writer and co-founder Pierre Shorette says in an interview with <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success"">Eurogamer</a>, explaining why Dispatch Season 1 took so long to make. The episodic superhero workplace comedy spent close to seven years in development. The time spent wasn't about endlessly refining a hit, but about dealing with lost funding, shifting plans, and simple survival. The upside is that the groundwork is now done, meaning a potential Season 2 would not need anything close to the same amount of time.</p><p>Game director Nick Herman is blunt about how close Dispatch came to ending. ""We had a publisher who dropped us halfway through because of … financial things,"" he says. Shorette places that moment in the context of the wider industry collapse.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dispatch-took-gta-6-amounts-of-time-to-make-but-season-2-may-not-take-nearly-as-long/1100-6537088/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-19T13:44:35.428093

Sonic The Hedgehog Takes On Godzilla In Sonic Rumble Event,"<p>There have been some mismatched crossovers before, but <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/sonic-rumble/"">Sonic Rumble</a> may be taking that to a new level as the King of the Monsters himself, Godzilla, invades Sonic the Hedgehog's new mobile game.</p><p>On December 22, Sega and Rovio will unleash Toho's iconic monster on Dr. Eggman's Toy World with a new stage: Godzilla Survival. The goal of that stage is simple. Players simply have to survive a Godzilla attack in the middle of the ocean while running from boat to boat. Trust us, you don't want to be stuck when Godzilla unleashes his atomic fire. Players will only get a single respawn on this stage, so run as if your virtual life depends upon it. Because it does.</p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbX04bi4I"" data-width=""854"" data-height=""480"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dgrbX04bi4I"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Sonic Rumble's free pass will unlock Godzilla and his fellow monster, Fire Rodan, without charging players.

Satisfactory Multiplayer: The Basics For Peer-to-Peer And Dedicated Server Hosting,"<p>Factory production lines in <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/satisfactory/"">Satisfactory</a> will grow to immense sizes the longer you play, and it can be hard to manage. A good friend, though, will cut that work in half. Satisfactory offers both peer-to-peer multiplayer and server-based multiplayer, and each of them has their disadvantages. We'll talk about how to get each of them going here.</p><p dir=""ltr"">There are three ways to host games in Satisfactory: Peer-to-peer games, self-hosted servers and rented servers. Peer-to-peer and self-hosted server options are both free, while a rented server option will have a monthly cost associated with it.

How to Use Satisfactory's Smart Splitters,"<p>Once you make it past the early game in <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/satisfactory/"">Satisfactory</a>, your production lines will skyrocket in complexity. As the number of items you're producing goes from a dozen to <em>dozens</em>, so will the number of conveyor belts carting all of that around. Mastering Smart Splitters will be a crucial part of advancing in Satisfactory, keeping your production lines navigable and easy to understand.</p><h3 dir=""ltr"">What is a Smart Splitter?</h3><p dir=""ltr"">The function of a regular splitter is fairly obvious--it splits a single conveyor belt into as many as three belts. That's great for a smelter cranking out more ingots than any single production line needs, such as having one smelter sending ingots to make plates, rods, and screws. There's no configuration needed here, either. It's just plug-and-play.</p><p dir=""ltr"">So what makes a Smart Splitter smart? Smart Splitters are programmable, allowing you to determine which items on a belt go where. There are programmable splitters, too, that do the same thing but at a higher level, allowing you to sort more than three different outputs.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-use-satisfactorys-smart-splitters/1100-6537226/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-19T12:23:47.256370

Battlefield 6 Update Improves Jet Combat And Knife Attacks,"<p>Earlier this week, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/"">Battlefield 6</a>'s Season 2 launch <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-season-2-update-delayed-to-help-refine-the-content-after-fan-feedback/1100-6537352/"">was pushed back to February 17</a> to give the development team more time to implement some needed changes. But that doesn't mean there won't be some improvements ahead of time. Electronic Arts has announced that Battlefield 6 Update 1.1.3.5 will arrive on Tuesday, January 20, and it's bringing some good news for anyone who wanted the jet combat to be more refined.</p><p>Going forward, jet cannon damage against flying vehicles has been greatly reduced, and it will take ""approximately 40% more hits"" to blow targets out of the sky. However, the air radar that was previously announced will not be included in this update.</p><p>Melee combat was also a priority for this update, which aims to improve ""responsiveness, consistency, and sprint behavior for melee attacks, including knives and the sledgehammer."" The Assault Ladder should also be more functional after this update, and the patch notes indicate that it has resolved some issues with the user interface and heads-up display in Redsec and Multiplayer, in addition to better stability for the Battle Royale and Gauntlet modes.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-improves-jet-combat-and-knife-attacks/1100-6537476/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-19T12:23:47.256370
Animal Crossing's 3.0 Update Just Killed Existing Hotel Businesses,"<p>It’s a bad time to be in the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossings-next-update-has-players-revisiting-long-deserted-islands/1100-6537314/"">Animal Crossing</a> hotel business. New Horizons’ 3.0 update introduced a wave of new features, but one addition stands out above the rest: a fully fledged hotel that appears on the pier of every island. Overnight, that official beachfront resort has effectively put countless player-made hotels out of business.</p><p>That might matter more if anyone besides Tom Nook--and the long-suffering players paying off his loans--actually exchanged money in New Horizons. Still, the arrival of an island-sanctioned hotel has made the decision to tear down pre-update resorts an easy one for many players who suddenly found their handmade creations obsolete.</p><p>""The fateful day has come for the new update, and the local resident-run hotel has fallen on hard times thanks to the illegally constructed hotel on the pier,"" wrote Redditor ll_LoneWolfe_ll in a <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qdah21/the_new_pier_hotel_spells_doom_for_my_islands/"">post</a>.

Some Of Monster Hunter Wilds' PC Issues Are Caused By Weird Glitch,"<p>Earlier this month, some <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/"">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> players reported that the game actually performed better on Steam when it has more DLC installed. Word about that improvement spread quickly among the Monster Hunter Wilds community, but the real reason for the game's improvement isn't about whether the game has DLC. Instead, the problem arises when Monster Hunter Wilds checks for DLC.</p><p><a href=""https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2026/01/the-latest-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-perf-drama-explained"">Digital Foundry</a> debunked the notion that more DLC was speeding up Monster Hunter Wilds. Instead, DF discovered that there's an automatic check for DLC that greatly impacts Wilds' performance. According to the report, when the option for DLC content was offered, the game itself ""checked for DLC thousands upon thousands of times, adding to the CPU load of an already over-burdened processor"" in less than a minute.</p><p>Essentially, this recurring issue in the hub area near a Support Desk Felynes has nothing to do with the DLC itself; it's happening because the game is constantly checking for DLC. That's slowing everything down, even if there isn't any DLC to be found.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/some-of-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-issues-are-caused-by-weird-glitch/1100-6537471/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-19T12:23:47.256370

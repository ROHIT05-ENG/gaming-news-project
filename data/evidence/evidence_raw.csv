We've seen Jason go from his backwoods roots to New York City, and even a short stint in space (yes, really). The 2009 remake retells the original story well, hitting every big story beat, ridiculous kill scenes, and the twist in a very faithful way. Friday the 13th: Part 2 is a direct follow-up to the first one, following a new group for Jason to stalk.</p><p>Both movies come in premium SteelBook cases, and the remake reprint includes brand-new cover art by artist Gary Pullin, reversible -- one side features the retro look of the original, while the other is the original poster for the remake. If you're unfamiliar, SteelBook cases are roughly the same size as a typical plastic Blu-ray case but much sturdier, and they often feature alternate art and other physical bonuses. For physical media collectors, the spines look really nice on a bookshelf, and these two horror movies are no different.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/friday-the-13th-remake-and-part-2-4k-blu-rays-are-available-to-preorder-on-amazon/1100-6537658/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-27T12:23:57.086919
Veteran Mario Kart Director Retires From Nintendo After Four Decades,"<p>Hideki Konno, a longtime director for Nintendo, has resigned from the video game publisher. Konno confirmed the news on<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/hideki.konno.10""> his Facebook page</a> months ago, which largely went unnoticed by the press at the time. His last month at Nintendo was July 2025.</p><p>The fans at the <a href=""https://famiboards.com/threads/hideki-konno-producer-and-game-designer-has-left-nintendo.16356/"">Famiboard Forums</a> were the first to notice Konno's employment update, which has since blown up online. Konno joined Nintendo in 1986, and worked as a designer and assistant director on Super Mario Bros. 2 and Super Mario Bros. 3. He also directed Yoshi's Island and SimCity for the SNES, and Luigi's Mansion for the GameCube.</p><p>Konno's most enduring work was on the Mario Kart franchise. He directed the first two games, Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, in addition to producing Mario Kart DS, Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 7, Mario Kart 8, and Mario Kart Tour. Although Konno didn't work on the most recent game, he received a special thanks credit in Mario Kart World.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/veteran-mario-kart-director-retires-from-nintendo-after-four-decades/1100-6537666/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-27T12:23:57.086919

How To Start New Game Plus In Code Vein 2,"<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/code-vein-ii/"">Code Vein 2</a> is a challenging Soulslike with tense and aggressive combat, as well as plenty of anime drama and compelling characters that should keep you invested throughout its <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-long-to-beat-code-vein-2/1100-6537312/"">fairly lengthy campaign</a>. It's a lot to take on, even for genre veterans--especially if you're looking to tackle all three of its endings. However, you won't necessarily need to see them all through to access a second playthrough of the game. If you're really eager to see things through a second time, you can start NG+ in Code Vein 2 and try it all again.</p><p>In Code Vein 2's NG+ mode, you'll start the story from the beginning and lose your map and mission progress. However, you'll take all the levels you've earned and items you've acquired into this fresh run of the campaign, giving you a bit of an edge in combat and beyond--especially during the first few hours. But NG+ also beefs up the enemies and bosses you'll encounter, too, granting them harder-hitting attacks and more health. So, you shouldn't expect to breeze your way through the whole thing.</p><p>Code Vein 2 doesn't exactly point you toward NG+ after beating the story, though, leaving this feature for you to discover on your own. Luckily, you won't have to stray too far to get started, if that's your goal. Here's how to start NG+ in Code Vein 2.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-start-new-game-plus-in-code-vein-2/1100-6537504/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-27T12:23:57.086919
How Long To Beat Code Vein 2,"<p>Soulslike games are known for their punishing combat and tense exploration, and <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/code-vein-ii/"">Code Vein 2</a> delivers both alongside a time-traveling story and sprawling open world. There's certainly a lot to see in this anime RPG, especially for those interested in checking out all of its optional content, so it's not the kind of game you'll wrap up in an afternoon. Instead, you'll want to strap in for a dense and challenging outing that should keep you occupied longer than you may expect. Just how much time will you spend in this one, though? Let's take a look at how long it takes to beat Code Vein 2.</p><h2>How long is Code Vein 2?</h2><p>How long it takes you to beat Code Vein 2 will depend on a variety of factors, such as how well you adapt to its aggressive Soulslike combat, how much open world content you seek out, and how many of its character-based side-quests you complete. There's a substantial amount of content to discover for those who take the time to see it all.</p><p>A playthrough of Code Vein 2 that focuses almost exclusively on <strong>pushing through its main story content is likely to take most players</strong> <strong>at least 25 hours</strong>. That being said, the game's overall difficulty is partially based on just how much of its additional objectives you tackle, as time spent in the open world and doing side-quests means earning more levels (thus, improved stats), better equipment, and more healing upgrades.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-long-to-beat-code-vein-2/1100-6537312/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-27T12:23:57.086919
"Reanimal Release Date, Trailer, Gameplay, And Everything Else We Know","<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/reanimal/"">Reanimal</a> is an upcoming horror-adventure game from Tarsier Studios, the creators of Little Nightmares and Little Nightmares II. Players control two children striving to survive and uncover the dark secrets of a hostile island that was once their home. With its haunting visuals and cooperative gameplay, Reanimal aims to expand on Tarsier’s signature style of intimate, atmospheric horror.</p><p>The game mixes puzzle-solving, stealth, and exploration across a world teeming with twisted environments and unsettling creatures. As a brother-and-sister duo, players navigate the island’s ruins, tackling environmental puzzles and avoiding monsters shaped by their past trauma. Combat takes a backseat to survival, putting the emotional bond between the siblings at the center of the experience.</p><div data-embed-type=""toc""><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a href=""https://www.gamespot.com"">hide</a>]</span><ul id=""toc_list"" class=""collapse in""><li><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com"">When will Reanimal be released?</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir=""ltr"" id=""When_will_Reanimal_be_released_"">When will Reanimal be released?</h2><p>Reanimal is officially set to launch on Friday, February 13, 2026.

Arc Raiders Will Let Solo Players Take On Squads After Headwinds Update,"<p>Embark Studios has gone into more detail about what players can expect from the Headwinds update for <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arc-raiders-review-us-against-the-world/1900-6418435/"">Arc Raiders</a>, which drops on January 27. Its most notable addition is ""Solo vs. Squads"" matchmaking, which no longer restricts solo players from only playing with other solo players. </p><p>Previously, it was impossible for those playing Arc Raiders by themselves to queue into matches where squads of players working together were also present. After the Headwinds update drops, players who are over level 40 can choose to use Solo vs. Squads matchmaking to allow for that. This will likely make Arc Raiders much harder for you, as squads tend to be <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-isnt-about-shooting-other-players-so-dont-expect-more-pvp-stuff/1100-6537242/"">more aggressive than solo players</a>, but the XP bonuses and rewards will be greater for solo players. </p><div data-embed-type=""video"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifzQV-VAB3M"" data-width=""100%"" data-height=""100%"">          <iframe src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ifzQV-VAB3M"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder="""" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> </p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-will-let-solo-players-take-on-squads-after-headwinds-update/1100-6537664/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-27T12:23:57.086919
"Highguard Devs Are ""Confident"" It's Not Going Away","<p>After going all quiet on the digital front for six weeks, Wildlight Entertainment's free-to-play fantasy shooter <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/highguard/"">Highguard</a> is officially out on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. If you were concerned about the game's longevity, you can rest easy because the company's co-founder and CEO said it isn't going anywhere.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=""https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/highguard-release-details-wildlight-overwatch-concord-1236641015/"">Variety on launch day</a>--January 26--Dusty Welch said that Highguard is nothing like <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/concord/"">Concord</a> or <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch/"">Overwatch</a> (even though it sort of rhymes with the former and is kind of synonymous with the latter). Specifically, Welch noted that, unlike the previous two games (which have been unceremoniously shut down), Highguard won't suffer a similar fate anytime soon. (It's worth mentioning that although Overwatch shut down, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/"">Overwatch 2</a> rose up in its place and has updates planned. Concord, however, is dead and gone.)</p><p>""What we're confident in is that we're not going anywhere,"" Welch explained. ""We're not going away. We as a team have a lot of experience in building franchises that have staying power. And this one, as [co-founder and game director Chad Grenier] alluded to, we have a year's worth of content that's near completion that is going to engage an audience for quite a bit of time. So we're excited to be able to bring that. We have the experience, but that said, we're humbled, and we hope people love this--but we're ready to engage with them.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/highguard-devs-are-confident-its-not-going-away/1100-6537665/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-27T12:23:57.086919

Bizarre TGA Closer Highguard Reaches Nearly 100K Concurrent Players Day-One On Steam,"<p>Wildlight Entertainment's free-to-play shooter <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/highguard/"">Highguard</a> is finally out on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S after weeks of silence, and already, the game has almost eclipsed 100,000 concurrents on Steam.</p><p>If you check out the Most Played chart on Steam, <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed"">you'll see that Highguard is clutching the number 10 spot (97,249 current)</a>, fending off the 2023 RPG <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/"">Baldur's Gate 3</a> (84,313 current) at the time of this writing. It's <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/US"">nowhere to be found in the PC gaming distributor's Top Sellers chart</a>, but that's probably because this list tracks the best-selling games by revenue, and <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/highguard-takes-a-refreshing-approach-to-microtransactions/1100-6537656/"">while Highguard's monetization strategy is pretty standard stuff for a free-to-play game</a>, it doesn't appear to have set the charts on fire.

Highguard Studio Isn't Concerned With Accruing Massive Player Counts On Launch Day,"<p>One of the developers behind Highguard says the concurrent player count for the new first-person shooter does not need ""to be super huge in order to be successful.""</p><p>As Highguard launches, previews are rolling out across a variety of different publications, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/highguard-is-a-fresh-enough-combo-that-it-could-be-the-start-of-a-whole-new-thing/1100-6537648/"">including GameSpot</a>.

""We're a small team. A six-player match [Highguard's max player count at launch] is not hard to find. What we're really hoping for is a core group of fans that love us. That will allow us to grow.

Highguard Is A Fresh Enough Combo That It Could Be The Start Of A Whole New Thing,"<p dir=""ltr"">While it is not the next game from the studio that brought us the likes of <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/titanfall-2/"">Titanfall 2</a> or <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/"">Apex Legends</a>, <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/highguard/"">Highguard</a> is coming from many former members of the Respawn team--developer Wildlight is about 100 employees and more than 60 worked on Titanfall 2 and/or Apex Legends. Highguard does not look anything like those games, though. <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-titanfall-devs-trade-in-mechs-for-horses-in-new-fantasy-raid-shooter-highguard/1100-6536921/"">The reveal trailer for Highguard</a> saw you riding a horse, not piloting a mech, and casting fantastical magic instead of utilizing sci-fi tech. But the trailer did not do much to tell us what the game actually is. So for about two months now, I have been looking for the answer to one question: What is Highguard?</p><p dir=""ltr"">Having now finally played Highguard, I am <em>still </em>unsure if I can actually classify it. If put on the spot, I would probably describe Highguard as a first-person shooter that follows both the attacker-versus-defender structure of <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/"">Rainbow Six Siege</a> and the lane-focused bomb-planting format of <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/valorant/"">Valorant</a>, but within the much larger objective-focused, base-destroying scope of the space battles of <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-battlefront-ii-2005/"">Star Wars Battlefront 2</a>. And on top of that, the game features an upgradable armament system that combines how looting works in Apex Legends with the ""shopping"" mechanic of Call of Duty's Zombies mode, as well as hero-character archetypes seen in a ton of different shooters. You have played or experienced pieces of Highguard in other games, but I feel very confident in saying that you have probably not played this exact chimera of pieces before.</p><p dir=""ltr"">You remember that sensation the first time you ever played a battle royale, or looter shooter, or extraction shooter? There are pieces of those genres we can identify in many different games that came before them, but with the earliest games in each of those genres, there was this sensation of novelty and inventiveness. They could not easily fit into the established boxes of the existing genres that inspired them.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/highguard-is-a-fresh-enough-combo-that-it-could-be-the-start-of-a-whole-new-thing/1100-6537648/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-27T12:23:57.086919

"Expedition 33 Studio Won't Scale Up For Next Project, Even Though It Can","<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was one of 2025's biggest breakout hits, and the game's commercial success has afforded developer Sandfall Interactive the opportunity to scale up for its next project. However, the company is not going to do that--and for what sounds like a good reason.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=""https://newsletter.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=99B77395-C1C6-4F52-AF3E-415FC009F6B1&amp;sid=7C18806E-AF5A-4F78-A29B-F02783429FF1"">Edge</a>, studio boss Guillaume Broche said he does not feel tempted to grow the company in the wake of the success of Expedition 33, which was the studio's debut title. Why not? He said (<a href=""https://www.gamesindustry.biz/clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-sandfall-says-expansion-isnt-tempting"">via GI.biz</a>), ""I think it's good to have limitations when you are creative.""</p><p>""It's the best way to be the best version of yourself. We could scale up now we have a lot more money, but I would say it's not tempting for us, because even the management team and myself, we'd have to be hands-on and doing things for ourselves,"" he said. ""We love making games more than we love managing, so we want to keep doing that. These past five years were some of the best of my life, and I want to be happy like that again.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-studio-wont-scale-up-for-next-project-even-though-it-can/1100-6537141/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-23T00:52:33.153039

"Arc Raiders Is My Game Of The Year, But Its Use Of Generative AI Really Sucks","<p dir=""ltr"">These past two months with Arc Raiders have been the most fun I've had with games all year. It represents the most exciting and unpredictable multiplayer landscape I've jumped into since Sea of Thieves in 2018, which I consider my favorite game ever made. It's safe to say I really love Arc Raiders. But it's become difficult to fully espouse those feelings as we learn about Embark Studio's use of generative AI.</p><p dir=""ltr"">According to the studio, Arc Raiders' voice acting was initially performed by humans, then used to ""train"" AI so that it could speak in the actors' voices while addressing any possible circumstance. For Embark, the team doesn't need to bring in the voice actors each time new content is added to the game. The AI voices learn to speak in the voices of the actors, which the actors are said to have agreed upon when they were hired, and the tools take it from there. Maybe it shouldn't have come as a surprise, since the team's previous game, The Finals, uses generative AI in a similar way. In an <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use"">interview</a>, Embark assured players that the game's visual artwork is entirely human-made, but admitted to using this text-to-speech training to bring voices to the game's shop NPCs, emotes, and other character barks. Knowing this has left me conflicted when I think to sing the game's praises.</p><p dir=""ltr"">On one hand, I can't deny the hold Arc Raiders has taken over me. The heart wants what the heart wants, and Embark's extraction shooter, rich in emergent, player-driven drama, has lit my heart on fire in a way few games ever have. At the same time, I've already written <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arc-raiders-review-us-against-the-world/1900-6418435/"">my review</a>. Though it was a glowing one that I don't regret, I also feel it's my job to call out this disappointing practice. In recent weeks, similar practices or plans have arisen in several high-profile examples. <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/"">Larian Studios' boss vouched</a> for it in some cases. Nexon's former CEO said <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-nexon-ceo-says-aaa-games-are-in-end-of-days-and-ai-is-about-to-rewrite-everything/1100-6536651/"">AI is about to rewrite everything</a> in the games industry.

Expedition 33 Actor Says The Game Awards Best Performance Award Doesn't Credit Everyone,"<p>The actor who provided the motion capture for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's Gustave has spoken out to say it would be ""more logical"" to have a Best Character category at awards shows to help give credit to everyone who contributed to bringing a character to life in a game.

"Paramount Sweetens Its Offer For Warner Bros., Including Massive Guarantee From Larry Ellison","<p>Despite Netflix announcing a deal with Warner Bros. Discovery to acquire the media and entertainment behemoth, Paramount has not given up on its own attempt to acquire the company by going directly to shareholders. Now, Paramount has announced that it has further sweetened its proposal in a bid to make a deal.</p><p>Paramount, which is run by David Ellison, has offered an ""irrevocable personal guarantee"" from his father, billionaire Oracle founder Larry Ellison, of $40.4 billion. Additionally, Paramount announced that it would increase and match Netflix's fee of $5.8 billion to be paid to WBD if the deal gets struck down in the regulatory process. Paramount's previous breakup fee was $5 billion.</p><p>What's more, Paramount said its revised proposal includes ""further improved flexibility to WBD on debt refinancing transactions, representations, and interim operating covenants."" The updated offer also includes the publishing of records that show the Ellison family trust owns 1.16 billion shares of Oracle stock, which is an attempt to show WBD shareholders that the Ellisons can indeed finance their $40.4 billion of the proposed $108 billion all-cash offer.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paramount-sweetens-its-offer-for-warner-bros-including-massive-guarantee-from-larry-ellison/1100-6537130/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-23T00:52:33.153039

The physical release has a reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork, a double-sided fold-out poster, and a booklet featuring new writing on the film by film journalist and screenwriter Michael Gingold.</p><p>On the disc, you'll find eight newly filmed interviews with the cast and crew of the film, including actors Alyssa Sutherland, Gabrielle Echols, and special make-up effects designer Luke Polti. The Blu-ray also includes featurettes on the movie, concept artwork, and promotional materials.</p><p>The film is presented in Dolby Vision and HDR10 with support for the original DTS-HD 5.1 master audio track and Dolby Atmos.</p><p><strong>Evil Dead: Rise Special Features</strong></p><ul><li>Reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Waldemar Witt</li><li>Double-sided fold-out poster featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Waldemar Witt</li><li>Collectors' booklet featuring new writing on the film by Michael Gingold</li><li>Audio commentary with director Lee Cronin and actors Alyssa Sullivan and Lily Sullivan</li><li>Eight New cast and crew interviews</li><li>Raising a New Evil Dead featurette</li><li>Ghost Train: 2013 short film directed by Lee Cronin</li><li>Behind-the-scenes video clips and still gallery</li><li>Concept artwork gallery</li><li>Storyboard gallery</li><li>Trailer and TV spots</li></ul></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Evil-Dead-Rise-Limited-Cronin/dp/B0FYQS3HN2?tag=gamespot-preorders-20"">Preorder at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>   </div> </div><p>Evil Dead: Rise was a big departure for the horror film franchise, as the movie swapped the creepy woods for a seemingly normal LA apartment building. Once again, the cursed Necronomicon features prominently in a tale about estranged sisters, giving rise to flesh-possessing demons and forcing one family to take on the most nightmarish version of motherhood imaginable.</p><p>If you don't feel like waiting for the new Arrow Video version of Evil Dead: Rise, you can pick up the older Blu-rays from Amazon. It's worth noting that the 4K and standard Blu-rays come with no special features whatsoever, but if you want the movies on their own, these are cheap alternatives. We'd still recommend waiting for the Arrow Video release, given that the price difference is slight and you're getting much content in return.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evil-dead-rise-limited-edition-blu-ra-preorder-guide/1100-6537127/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-23T00:52:33.153039

Thankfully, Arcade1Up's NBA Jam cabinet offers an authentic way to revisit the best entries in the series. </p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/ARCADE1UP-2-Player-Control-Machine-Cabinet-Classic/dp/B0D7JG6FFD?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                                                      <div>                        <a href=""https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/xLBRak"">See at Best Buy</a>           </div>                                                     </div>      </div>   </div> </div><hr /><div title=""[Amazon Hub] [Arcade1Up] Arcade Machines (December 2025)"" data-embed-type=""buylink"" data-ref-id=""4762"" data-template=""2"" data-size=""buylink__large"" data-title=""[Amazon Hub] [Arcade1Up] Arcade Machines (December 2025)"" data-collection="""" class=""norewrite"">    <div class=""buylink__container"">                                                                                                                                                                                               <div class=""buylink__item"">                  <div class=""buylink__image-container clickable"">                                            <img class=""buylink__image"" src=https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4588925-pac-manclassic.png alt="""">                                 <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&isPreview=1&asins=B0DF3KQXS3,B0DJGHWD1G,B0FM8L7BDJ,B0FM8KVTZB,B0FM8H6QDQ,B0FM8LCZWS,B0D7JG6FFD,B0BYQNPTCF,B0CHWWLPML,B0DG44KFVL,B0BYQ7CNHD,B0FH7JCFPT,B0CNKD3DFP,B0CBNPXDL8,B0FM8J2C8S,B0C1HSJW3C,B09B1FNZJJ,B0BYQ7S68P,B0CZCR7ZYT,B0CCPR398D,B0CJSRJRBQ,B09TS7V3ZS,B0BNK7Y6SQ&tag=gamespot-promos-20""></a>                              </div>                   <div class=""buylink__text"">                      <p class=""buylink__title text-bold"">                        <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&isPreview=1&asins=B0DF3KQXS3,B0DJGHWD1G,B0FM8L7BDJ,B0FM8KVTZB,B0FM8H6QDQ,B0FM8LCZWS,B0D7JG6FFD,B0BYQNPTCF,B0CHWWLPML,B0DG44KFVL,B0BYQ7CNHD,B0FH7JCFPT,B0CNKD3DFP,B0CBNPXDL8,B0FM8J2C8S,B0C1HSJW3C,B09B1FNZJJ,B0BYQ7S68P,B0CZCR7ZYT,B0CCPR398D,B0CJSRJRBQ,B09TS7V3ZS,B0BNK7Y6SQ&tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Arcade1Up Cabinets and Countercades</a>           </p>                                                       <p class=""buylink__deck"">                          <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&isPreview=1&asins=B0DF3KQXS3,B0DJGHWD1G,B0FM8L7BDJ,B0FM8KVTZB,B0FM8H6QDQ,B0FM8LCZWS,B0D7JG6FFD,B0BYQNPTCF,B0CHWWLPML,B0DG44KFVL,B0BYQ7CNHD,B0FH7JCFPT,B0CNKD3DFP,B0CBNPXDL8,B0FM8J2C8S,B0C1HSJW3C,B09B1FNZJJ,B0BYQ7S68P,B0CZCR7ZYT,B0CCPR398D,B0CJSRJRBQ,B09TS7V3ZS,B0BNK7Y6SQ&tag=gamespot-promos-20"">Check out all deals and in-stock products.</a>             </p>                                              </div>                  <div class=""buylink__links"">                                                       <input               class=""buylink__extra""               type=""checkbox""             />                                                                                                                          <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&isPreview=1&asins=B0DF3KQXS3,B0DJGHWD1G,B0FM8L7BDJ,B0FM8KVTZB,B0FM8H6QDQ,B0FM8LCZWS,B0D7JG6FFD,B0BYQNPTCF,B0CHWWLPML,B0DG44KFVL,B0BYQ7CNHD,B0FH7JCFPT,B0CNKD3DFP,B0CBNPXDL8,B0FM8J2C8S,B0C1HSJW3C,B09B1FNZJJ,B0BYQ7S68P,B0CZCR7ZYT,B0CCPR398D,B0CJSRJRBQ,B09TS7V3ZS,B0BNK7Y6SQ&tag=gamespot-promos-20"">See at Amazon</a>                                                                                                                                                                           <a href=""https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/6yvQLQ"">See at Best Buy</a>                                                                                                                                                                           <a href=""https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https://www.walmart.com/search?q=Arcade1Up&subId1=subid_value"">See at Walmart</a>                     </div>                         </div>                     </div> </div><p>NBA Jam debuted exclusively in arcades in 1993 and was ported to consoles the following year. The Tournament Edition, which launched in 1994, is essentially an updated and expanded version of the original NBA Jam. As the name suggests, the main addition was Tournament mode. It's still 2v2 basketball, but Midway added a third player to each team, allowing you to make substitutions throughout each game. The Tournament Edition also expanded player stat categories.</p><p>NBA Hangtime was developed by the same team at Midway, just with a different title because the NBA Jam moniker was sold to Acclaim Entertainment. Midway once again expanded the rosters to five players and introduced a custom player creator, but NBA Hangtime is still very much an NBA Jam game.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nba-jam-arcade1up-deluxe-home-arcade-cabinet-best-deal/1100-6537125/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-23T00:52:33.153039

"Nex Playground Boss Says The Console Solves The Wii ""Problem""","<p>While Sony and Nintendo have expanded their lead over Xbox, a dark horse console had <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kinects-revenge-nex-playground-outsells-xbox-hardware-in-the-us/1100-6537053/"">a very strong showing</a> in third place in November. The Nex Playground has emerged as a breakout hit, and CEO David Lee believes that one of the reasons why its been so successful is because the console has solved the Wii ""problem.""</p><p>Nearly two decades ago, the Wii powered Nintendo's post-GameCube comeback with its motion controls and unique games. Lee argues that the scope of Wii's success made it difficult to sustain in the long term. Instead of trying to sell games like Wii, Nex Playground is offering its titles as part of a subscription service.</p><p>""One of the most important things we should do is learn from history and try not to commit the same limitations, and that's why we have a subscription model,"" Lee told <a href=""https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-want-a-nex-playground-in-every"">The Game Business</a>. ""Nintendo expanded the audience with Wii. When you expand the audience, and they want different things, and they only buy Wii Fit, Wii Sports and not many others … that's a bit of a problem.""</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nex-playground-boss-says-the-console-solves-the-wii-problem/1100-6537124/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-23T00:52:33.153039

The 1988 movie raised the bar for film animation and is widely credited with introducing mainstream audiences outside Japan to the medium. However, the anime adaptation is only part of the tale. Like innumerable other anime projects, Akira is adapted from a much longer--though lesser-known--manga series.

It's currently sold out, but it gets restocked periodically at Amazon, so it's worth checking back to see if it's available.</p><p>Set in a dark future timeline, Akira first began publication in 1982 and ran for 120 chapters. Taking place in the post-apocalyptic city of Neo-Tokyo, the series examines the after-effects of a mysterious explosion that almost destroyed the city. Thirty years later, teenage biker gang leader Shotaro Kaneda finds himself in the middle of a plot that involves militant revolutionaries, psychically gifted individuals, military forces, and his childhood friend, Tetsuo Shima, who has begun to develop dangerously destructive psychic powers of his own. Akira manga was critically acclaimed for its mature themes, well-developed characters, intriguing storylines, and Otomo's artwork. In the years since its publication, it's become regarded as one of the pioneering works in the then-burgeoning Cyberpunk sci-fi subgenre.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/akira-hardcover-manga-deals/1100-6537101/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2025-12-23T00:52:33.153039

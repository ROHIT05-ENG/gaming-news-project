"Download The Hytale Launcher Now, As Hypixel Estimates ""Over 1 Million"" Players At Launch","<p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/hytale/"">Hytale</a> has been on quite a development journey. After being acquired and subsequently shuttered by Riot Games, the original development team bought the Minecraft rival back and recommenced development in November 2025. On January 13, the title goes into early access, which the team acknowledges will be unpolished and full of bugs. Still, Hypixel--the developer behind one of the most popular Minecraft servers of all time--is expecting mammoth launch-day numbers, estimating ""over 1 million"" players. To that end, the studio is encouraging users to download the game's launcher ahead of time in order.</p><p>Hypixel's CEO, Simon Collins-Laflamme, <a href=""https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010458001455640636?s=20"">posted on X</a> stating, ""We expect over 1 million players on the early access release day for Hytale ... Please download the launcher today and log in now to help us significantly reduce launch-day stress."" Hypixel's preorders have been open since early December, so the team has had around a month to gauge interest, meaning this player estimate is based on those figures and not just speculation.</p><p>Hypixel has already allowed mod creators early access to the game so they can research and develop the <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-hytale-mods/2900-7397/"">best Hytale mods</a> for the early access release. Modders are adding new game modes, cosmetics, items, and quality-of-life improvements to the game, with more being added daily.

Diablo 4 Leaderboards Are Coming,"<p>Leaderboards have previously been a part of the Diablo franchise, and starting today, they're back. Blizzard is releasing a new <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/"">Diablo 4</a> update across all platforms that reintroduces leaderboards as well as the multi-level dungeons known as The Tower.</p><p>Blizzard's <a href=""https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24247514/dominate-the-tower-and-leaderboards-beta"">official site</a> states that The Tower and the leaderboards are both in beta, with more refinements to come in future seasons. The leaderboards will be divided by the seven playable classes--Paladin, Rogue, Druid, Barbarian, Sorcerer, Necromancer, and Spiritborn. Additionally, the leaderboard rankings will only be set for two weeks periods rather than the entire season. Essentially, everyone gets a chance for a fresh start while Blizzard works out any kinks in the system.</p><p>The leaderboard's rankings are directly linked to The Tower as players' scores are tabulated based on their performance when fighting monsters and bosses. Experienced players with refined character builds should be right at home in the chaos. For less experienced players, The Tower provides enhanced damage levels when players destroy the numerous pylons in the complex. That may not be the equal of having incredibly powerful characters, but it means that players of all skill levels are far from helpless against the onslaught of creatures coming for them in The Tower.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-leaderboards-are-coming/1100-6537318/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-13T00:49:30.351844
Nintendo's Switch Game Voucher Program Will End Permanently This Month,"<p>Nintendo is discontinuing the sale of Switch Game Vouchers, a program that allowed Nintendo Switch Online members to get a discount on first-party Switch games by purchasing two game vouchers for $100. While existing vouchers will remain valid, no new vouchers will be sold after January 30, 2026.</p><p>With precious few discounts available for first-party Switch games, Nintendo's game vouchers allowed players to save a little cash by purchasing two vouchers for $100, saving $10 per game as long as both were $60 titles.

Luxo Jr. can stand next to the buildable Pixar Ball or balance on top of it by making a couple of simple adjustments.</p><p>Lego designed Luxo Jr. as a fully articulated model capable of being displayed in poses from the iconic Pixar production logo and short film starring the semi-anthropomorphic lamp. The light bulb doesn't actually work, but Lego did a good job of making it look realistic.</p><p>As a Lego model, Luxo Jr. is quite different than the vast majority of Disney Pixar building sets. Designed for experienced builders and collectors, the model has an interesting build process thanks to its multi-hinged arm, modifiable base, and the many Easter Eggs Lego worked into the authentic recreation.</p><p>There are dozens of references to Pixar movies hidden throughout the Luxo Jr. and Pixar Ball builds. For instance, the Pizza Planet truck from the first Toy Story movie is included inside the light bulb. The lamp's base has a miniature build referencing Marlin &amp; Dory from Finding Nemo as well as clever allusions to Inside Out, Cars, Coco, WALL-E, A Bug's Life--and possibly others that we missed.</p><p>The instruction booklet calls out the Finding Nemo character builds as well as the mini-builds found in the Pixar Ball. The interior of the colorful ball features multiple characters from five different Pixar movies:</p><ul><li>Toy Story - Woody &amp; Buzz</li><li>Up - Carl &amp; Russell</li><li>Monsters, Inc. - Mike &amp; Sully</li><li>The Incredibles family</li><li>Ratatouille - Linguini &amp; Remy</li></ul><p>As mentioned, one of the display modes is Luxo Jr. ""deflating"" the toy ball, just like in the production logo's animation sequence. Once you remove two of the rounded plates from the ball, Luxo Jr. can connect to the top. It's a quick and easy modification. The Pixar Ball has its own buildable stand, so the model still feels stable with Luxo Jr. on the ball.</p></div>                <div class=""item-buttons"">                  <div>                      <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRW73TRY?tag=gamespot-promos-20"">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>   </div> </div><figure data-align=""center"" data-size=""large"" data-img-src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4633547-luxojr.legothumbnail.png"" data-ref-id=""1300-4633547"" data-ratio=""0.563"" data-width=""1000"" data-embed-type=""image"" style=""width: 1000px""><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4633547-luxojr.legothumbnail.png""><img alt=""Lego Ideas: Disney Pixar Luxo Jr. (21357)"" src=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4633547-luxojr.legothumbnail.png"" srcset=""https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4633547-luxojr.legothumbnail.png 1000w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1595/15950357/4633547-luxojr.legothumbnail.png 480w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" data-width=""1000""></a><figcaption>Lego Ideas: Disney Pixar Luxo Jr. (21357)</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>Luxo Jr. was the star of Pixar's first short film in 1986.

Fans can watch the original theatrical edition on 4K as well as the Director's Cut on 4K and 1080p. The Director's Cut (112m) is approximately eight minutes longer than the theatrical release (104m).</p><p>The upscaled 4K Blu-ray editions support Dolby Vision and HDR10. Audio formats include Dolby Atmos and Dolby TrueHD 5.1/7.1 surround sound.</p><p>The two Director's Cut discs have the special features from previous Blu-ray editions, including the three alternate endings. The theatrical 4K Blu-ray disc also has a brand-new featurette titled Don't Enter 1408. <em><br /></em></p><p>The exclusive steelbook case features new artwork by graphic designer Gary Pullin (Ghoulish Gary). The front of the case is a rendering of the door to the eponymous hotel room, while the back features protagonist Mike Enslin's daughter Katie with manuscript pages floating around her and the name of the hotel (The Dolphin). The interior artwork recreates the memorable scene inside the torn apart hotel room where Mike sinks to his knees and reaches out toward Katie. The slipcover features a stylized and modified version of the original promotional image featuring Cusack and Jackson. The new artwork looks fantastic, and it'd be great to see more limited-edition steelbooks opt for a more creative design like Lionsgate has here.</p><p><strong>1408 Amazon Exclusive Edition Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Exclusive steelbook case</li><li>Exclusive slipcover</li><li>2 Cuts / 3 Discs  <ul><li>Theatrical (4K)</li><li>Director's (4K &amp; 1080p)</li></ul></li><li>Upscaled 4K (2160p)</li><li>HDR: Dolby Vision / HDR10</li><li>Audio: Dolby Atmos / Dolby TrueHD 5.1/7.1</li></ul><p><strong>Special Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Don't Enter 1408 featurette (New)</li><li>Audio commentary with director Mikael Håfström and writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski</li><li>Alternate endings</li><li>Deleted scenes with optional commentary</li><li>The Secrets of 1408 (22 minutes)  <ul><li>Behind-the-scenes look at the making of 1408.

The 1,201 piece model is based on Gandalf the Grey's battle with Durin's Bane in the movie adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring.</p><p>Once fully built, the frame resembles the stone pillars and archways of the First and Second Halls in the Mines of Moria. The buildable stand for the Gandalf the Grey minifigure represents the narrowest point on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm.</p><p>With the Book Nook closed, as shown above, the model is 5.5 x 6.5 x 9 inches and captures the moment Gandalf confidently blocks the Balrog's path and exclaims, ""You shall not pass!"" The memorable line of dialogue is quoted on the Book Nook's front plaque. Lego Gandalf wields his signature staff in one hand and Glamdring (his sword) in the other.</p><p>The buildable Balrog figure is essentially an articulated action figure, because you can pose his wings, arms, hands, legs, and fingers. Balrog comes with a whip accessory, and flame elements attach to his back. Lego used flexible sheets of translucent plastic to make the wings. It's only been included with one other Lego set: the 269-piece Fell Beast, which was a purchase bonus Lego Insiders when the massive Barad-dûr building set launched in 2024.</p><p>You can disconnect the bridge from each side to open the Book Nook. This alternate display mode showcases the Balrog's imposing presence with its wings fully unfurled. Flame elements decorate the left and right archways, which is a reference to the Balrog of Moria's ability to start a fire by flapping its wings.</p><p>With the Book Nook fully unfolded, the wider model is 17.5 x 6.5 x 9 inches.

"RAM Shortages May Lead To More Expensive TVs And Devices, Warns Samsung","<p>The increasing demand for AI among tech companies is one of the reasons why the global shortage of memory chips remains an ongoing issue. And while it's expected to adversely affect the production of smartphones, Samsung Electronics co-CEO T M Roh has warned that TVs and home appliances may also be hit by shortages and increased prices.</p><p>""As this situation is unprecedented, no company is immune to its impact,"" said Roh via <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/world/china/samsung-double-mobile-devices-powered-by-googles-gemini-800-mln-units-this-year-2026-01-05/"">Reuters</a>. According to the report, Roh noted that TVs and home appliances will also feel the pinch from the shortages and he didn't rule out price hikes to compensate for them. Samsung is the biggest manufacturer of TVs in the world, and Roh said it the impact of the RAM shortages will be ""inevitable.""</p><p>The rise in consumer-electronic prices would also throw a large wrench in Microsoft's ongoing ""This Is an Xbox"" strategy, as smart TVs, including those made by Samsung, are among the growing list of platforms capable of playing Game Pass titles.</p><a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ram-shortages-may-lead-to-more-expensive-tvs-and-devices-warns-samsung/1100-6537306/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/"">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",2026-01-13T00:49:30.351844

"Penises set Dispatch apart, and I mean that quite sincerely","I think a lot of Dispatch can be distilled into a single moment at the beginning of the game when the player comes face to face with a penis. There it is, dangling visibly between the legs of an unclothed, toxic-drenched super-villain you're about to fight. The camera all but centers on it. There's no way you can miss it unless you've flipped the nudity switch off, in which case it's replaced by an even more conspicuous black box that only amplifies the naughtiness of the part hidden within. But most people don't turn nudity off because they're expecting boobs. That's what we usually see. In Dispatch, however, it's a penis we see waggling unavoidably on our screens. Read more"

End-game boss? Spoiled. Every collectible location and what happens after you've collected every magic hat or whatever? Spoiled. Plot twists, because I might as well go all in at this point? Spoiled.

Skin Deep was this year's reminder that it's a privilege to recognise a developer's handwriting,"Out in space there are objects that orbit one another for so long, and at such a stately pace, that when they both eventually arrive at the same point, they don't collide with some kind of awful explosion.

Blades of Fire and Hideo Kojima showed me I can still be surprised by a video game and that originality is essential,"I am pretty confident in my ability to judge video games. I've been playing them (increasingly badly over more recent years!) for almost 40 years and writing about them for over 20, so it's rare that something blindsides me. But that's exactly what happened with Blades of Fire , the action soulslike adventure from Mercury Steam. I loved the studio's Castlevania rethink, Lords of Shadow, but was so-so on its output since, including the Nintendo-published Metroid Dread . My expectations for Blades of Fire were low to moderate. Incredible, then, that I've not played another game released this year that I enjoyed more. Read more"

"Balatro and Silksong ""Don't Make Sense Financially"" And Are ""Deeply Loved,"" Says Analyst","Balatro and Hollow Knight: Silksong ""shouldn't exist,"" according to industry analyst Joost van Dreunen. He elaborated that, ""They don't make rational sense financially, and yet somehow they are deeply loved."" Their commercial viability is an undeniable fact. However, the scale of their success baffles industry conventional wisdom. Van Drunen is professor at the NYU Stern School of Business and a strategic advisor for the community development agency ELO. In an interview with GameIndustry.biz , van Dreunen discussed how the shifting macroeconomics of video games is creating space for smaller projects to become massive successes. He compares the shift to the way television challenged the Hollywood business model. Free-to-play games like Candy Crush compete with, and even undermine, big-budget blockbusters like GTA or Call of Duty. Yet, there are an increasing number of games that skirt outside either model, such as Silksong. The lower-tech production values of some indie games may also be a big asset. Van Dreunen said, ""I'm a big fan of the idea that low tech is a much more interesting design factor than high tech. I think, demonstrably, whenever new technology comes out, what studios tend to do is just increase the final product. They make it more complex, and therefore they negate the productivity gains."" Perhaps Balatro and Silksong can be impressive with smaller budgets and development teams because they leverage the productivity shifts bigger studios would use to expand their efforts.

Rhythm Games Are Marching To The Beat Of Their Own Drum,"Unbeatable introduces itself with a simple, yet punchy premise: we find a group of teens in a band, on the run from and getting into fights with the local authority. The twist? Instead of playing out as a traditional story-driven game, the beating drum of the experience is structured around rhythm-based gameplay. Sequences such as dreams and combat encounters are all guided by Unbeatable's take on the classic Guitar Hero notes-on-a-fretboard style gameplay, in which prompts tell you which buttons to press in time with the music. Here, it's only two buttons: up and down. And while there are more traditional gameplay moments--like minigames where you must memorize movement patterns and react to the beat of different tempos--in a similar fashion to Rhythm Heaven, it's the harmonious intersection with all the game's other sections, which would normally play out as mere cutscenes, that makes Unbeatable stand out. A decade ago, right around the time that Rock Band and Guitar Hero launched their respective swansongs marking the decline of the domestic rhythm game era, it would have been novel to see a studio blend rhythm game mechanics into a narrative adventure. But Unbeatable is just one example of this approach; dozens of studios have been toying with the intersection of music games with other genres. Now, 10 years after the rhythm game heyday, they're basking in a renewed appreciation of those elements. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Arc Raiders Snap And Salvage Quest Guide,"If you're working your way through Stella Montis, Arc Raiders ' first post-launch map, you may have the Snap and Salvage quest. This multi-step quest requires you to find multiple spots of interaction, as well as recover some specific pieces of loot. It can take some time to figure all of this out on your own, so we've put together a step-by-step process to get you through it. Note that each part of this quest can be completed across multiple runs, so there's no need to wrap it all up in a single raid. That being said, you'll need to extract with the Magnetron and Flow Controller items once you find them, so it's probably best to bring in an augment that has a safe pocket or two to ensure you don't accidentally lose these precious items if you find them during your raid. Here's how to complete Snap and Salvage in Arc Raiders. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"Obsidian Was The Only Choice For Fallout: New Vegas, Says Todd Howard","This year marks the 15th anniversary of Fallout: New Vegas , the beloved spin-off that was developed by Obsidian Entertainment. Bethesda hasn't entrusted the franchise to many other developers, and according to studio boss Todd Howard, Obsidian was the only choice to take on New Vegas. ""They were the only choice,"" Howard told Game Informer (via GamesRadar ). ""They had done something similar with [Star Wars] Knights of the Old Republic 2, and we knew them really well. We knew we were going onto Skyrim, the franchise was back, but we knew there was going to be a long break until Fallout 4--how can we keep this going?"" Obsidian was founded by ex-Interplay and Black Isle Studios devs who previously worked on the original Fallout as well as a canceled version of Fallout 3. That made the studio a natural home for New Vegas. Howard also said that the only note Bethesda had ahead of development was to focus on the game's warring factions and the players' ability to choose between them. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"Razer's New Holographic AI Assistant Sits On Your Desk And Promises Help, Not Judgement","A lot of interesting technology has been revealed at the Consumer Electronics Show 2026 this week, but one of the strangest might be Razer's Project Ava, an AI-powered desktop companion.

These New Lego Star Wars Smart Play Sets Mix Bricks With Tech,"At CES 2026 this week, Lego introduced its brand-new Smart Play system--a series of high-tech Lego bricks, tiles, and minifigures equipped with sensors, accelerometers, light and sound sensors, a miniature speaker with an onboard synthesizer, and more. The company says these pieces can communicate to enhance interactivity. The system will launch in March with three Star Wars sets, available for preorder starting January 9. While this isn't the first time Lego has experimented with electronic components, there are key differences with Smart Play pieces. For starters, they can detect nearby NFC-equipped smart tags.

Here's a closer look at what you can expect, starting with the new Lego Star Wars sets that will make use of this technology. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"Penises set Dispatch apart, and I mean that quite sincerely","I think a lot of Dispatch can be distilled into a single moment at the beginning of the game when the player comes face to face with a penis.

There's no way you can miss it unless you've flipped the nudity switch off, in which case it's replaced by an even more conspicuous black box that only amplifies the naughtiness of the part hidden within. But most people don't turn nudity off because they're expecting boobs. That's what we usually see. In Dispatch, however, it's a penis we see waggling unavoidably on our screens. Read more"

End-game boss? Spoiled. Every collectible location and what happens after you've collected every magic hat or whatever? Spoiled. Plot twists, because I might as well go all in at this point? Spoiled.

Skin Deep was this year's reminder that it's a privilege to recognise a developer's handwriting,"Out in space there are objects that orbit one another for so long, and at such a stately pace, that when they both eventually arrive at the same point, they don't collide with some kind of awful explosion.

Blades of Fire and Hideo Kojima showed me I can still be surprised by a video game and that originality is essential,"I am pretty confident in my ability to judge video games. I've been playing them (increasingly badly over more recent years!) for almost 40 years and writing about them for over 20, so it's rare that something blindsides me. But that's exactly what happened with Blades of Fire , the action soulslike adventure from Mercury Steam. I loved the studio's Castlevania rethink, Lords of Shadow, but was so-so on its output since, including the Nintendo-published Metroid Dread . My expectations for Blades of Fire were low to moderate. Incredible, then, that I've not played another game released this year that I enjoyed more. Read more"

These New Lego Star Wars Smart Play Sets Mix Bricks With Tech,"At CES 2026 this week, Lego introduced its brand-new Smart Play system--a series of high-tech Lego bricks, tiles, and minifigures equipped with sensors, accelerometers, light and sound sensors, a miniature speaker with an onboard synthesizer, and more. The company says these pieces can communicate to enhance interactivity. The system will launch in March with three Star Wars sets, available for preorder starting January 9. While this isn't the first time Lego has experimented with electronic components, there are key differences with Smart Play pieces. For starters, they can detect nearby NFC-equipped smart tags. They're also wirelessly charged. This is a big improvement compared to the Lego Super Mario toys, which required AAA batteries to function. All of the pieces work with standard Lego bricks. Each piece contains a custom-made chip that is smaller than a standard Lego stud. So what do they do exactly? Lego says the Smart Bricks will respond to actions with appropriate sounds and behaviors. Here's a closer look at what you can expect, starting with the new Lego Star Wars sets that will make use of this technology. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
8BitDo Reveals Ultimate 3E Modular Controller For Xbox And PC,"8BitDo unveiled the next generation of its flagship Ultimate controller series at CES 2026--and it now makes sense why the manufacturer hasn't released an Xbox version of the Ultimate 2 .

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's Files Flat Out Explain All Its Naming References And Meanings,"Fans digging into the files of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 have discovered explanations and sometimes even external links outlining the meaning behind the names of the RPG's various characters and enemies. As spotted by Reddit user Responsible-Race-575 , the game's asset files have detailed descriptions that explain why specific characters and enemies are named what they are, including genders, additional context behind the origin of their names, and sometimes even links to Wikipedia to help further explain related concepts. Many are derived from French, the home country of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 developer Sandfall Interactive. For example, the Machinapieds enemy is simply ""Machine with feet"" in French, while the Licorne enemy is French for unicorn. Some enemies are a combination of French words or a wordplay on French phrases. Barbasucette is a combination of the French words for beard and lollipop, for example. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Someone Dressed Up As Pac-Man To Play Pac-Man During AGDQ Livestream,"Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ), a bi-annual charity livestream, kicked off this week with an assortment of speedrunners playing new and old games, from Jet Set Radio to Wuchang: Fallen Feathers . A wacky event that tends to attract all sorts of characters, someone made a surprise appearance during AGDQ on January 5: Pac-Man, who played Pac-Man World 2 . Well, it wasn't really Pac-Man. The day started with speedruns of games like Final Fantasy X , Mega Man Battle Network , Nuclear Throne , and Wolfenstein: The Old Blood . As the multi-hour livestream went on, the event's organizers booted up Pac-Man World 2 for Minecraft content creator DThaiPome to play. If the event raised $10,000, then Pac-Man--really, DThaiPome in a blow-up Pac-Man costume--would speedrun his own game. That fundraising goal was easily crushed, and DThaiPome, in a Pac-Man outfit, played some Pac-Man. Playing a remastered version of the classic 2002 platformer, DThaiPome managed to beat Pac-Man World 2 in approximately 30 minutes, employing all kinds of skips and tricks to get to the end as quickly as possible.

Nvidia Reportedly Combatting GPU Shortages By Bringing Back Discontinued Graphics Card,"As GPU prices continue to skyrocket and stock becomes increasingly scarce, rumors are swirling that Nvidia might be about to resurrect a previously discontinued line of hardware.

"Resident Evil 4 Remake Scrapped An Opening Chapter Starring Ashley, Files Show","Resident Evil 4 Remake's opening moments could have played out much differently if Capcom had not opted to cut an opening referred to as ""Chapter 0,"" in which players would have controlled Ashley and witnessed her kidnapping at the hands of the Los Illuminados. At least, that's according to datamined files spotted by an eagle-eyed fan. Using leftover pieces from ""Chapter 0"" found in the game's files, YouTuber Thekempy has pieced together what the game's lost opening might have looked like in a recent video. Players would have controlled Ashley alone in a forest at night as she encountered a Los Illuminados ritual, something which can actually be briefly seen in a story trailer for the game released in October 2022. After witnessing the sacrifice, Ashley would have made her way to the center of the game's village, potentially having to use the light of her phone to navigate and sneak past deadly enemies like the Ganado. Her running would become more frantic as the chapter continued, eventually witnessing a Ganado kidnapping another character, Luis Serra. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Red Dead Redemption 2 Players Have Discovered A Long-Hidden Mystery,"Red Dead Redemption 2 has been out since 2018, but Rockstar Games' blockbuster title apparently still has some secrets hidden away. RDR2 players have uncovered a pattern of web that only shows up on the map at a certain time of day, and the ultimate destination of this mystery hasn't been fully solved yet. The Strange Man YouTube channel (via IGN ) shared the first video guide to the webs, and credited the discovery to three players: goldenplaysterraria, pariah87, and u/FL4VA-01. Like the dreamcatchers quest in the game, players can shoot the webs and get them to release a feather. However, there's only a one-hour window in-game to find a web, and each web only appears at a specific time throughout the in-game night cycle. In a follow-up video, Strange Man reveals the location of a ninth web in the middle of the spider puzzle, which leads to a telephone pole and more clues. The search is currently centered on a guitar symbol, and players are combing over Fort Wallace, since it's the closest location with guitars to the newly discovered symbol.

"Arc Raiders Now Features ""Aggression-Based Matchmaking,"" Dev Confirms","If you've been noticing that recent matches of Arc Raiders are ending in a lot more PvP skirmishes than usual, there's a high likelihood that you might've had it coming. In a recent interview with GamesBeat's Dean Takahashi, the CEO of Embark Studios, Patrick Söderlund, confirmed that the popular extraction shooter has recently been employing a kind of ""aggression-based matchmaking"" to group up more like-minded players. During an inquiry about the studio's approach to matchmaking, Söderlund said, ""Since a week ago or so, we introduced a system where we also matchmake based on how prone you are to PvP or PvE. So if your preference is to do PvE, and have less conflict with players, you'll get more matched up."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Steam Smashes New Concurrent-User Record With More Than 41 Million Online,"Steam hit a major milestone already this year, setting a new record for concurrent users. According to SteamDB, the platform peaked at 41,816,052 users online at the same time actively playing games. Not only that, but a new record for actively gaming users was also set, with that figure reaching almost 13.4 million as compared to March's 13.2 million record. The timing of the record is likely no coincidence. Steam's annual Winter Sale , which wraps up later today, offered steep discounts on a wide range of popular titles, along with more modest deals on newer releases. Sales events have long been a reliable driver of traffic on Steam, pulling in both longtime users and players returning to pick up games they missed throughout the year. Steam's growth has been steady for well over a decade, but it has accelerated sharply in recent years. A notable spike occurred in early 2020, when COVID-19 lockdowns pushed concurrent users past 23 million, later climbing to 28 million just a couple of years later . The company even offered a bundle of games, which went to COVID relief at the time . Since then, the rise of live-service games and consistently strong seasonal sales have helped keep players logged in, especially during holidays. Games like Arc Riders continue to grow, hitting over 3 million concurrent players this week . Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Rainbow Six Siege Players Hit With 67-Day Ban After Another Apparent Hack,"Following a hack that happened over the Christmas weekend, Rainbow Six Siege players are finding themselves in the ban house thanks to yet another hack that references the nonsensical and popular 6-7 meme. According to The Gamer , Ubisoft's tactical shooter is being hacked by some unknown force that's handing out bans for 67 days. Players are reportedly posting on social media that their accounts have been flagged for an unexplained "" harassment offence ,"" leading to their accounts being suspended from matchmaking. Content creator VarsityGaming, who's been memeing the hack since it happened on January 4, corroborated the 67-day ban on their social media, suggesting that Siege may be down for two more days.

The Last Of Us Star Discusses Neil Druckmann's Exit From The Show,"The Last of Us Season 3 is on the way, but Neil Druckmann--who helped created the game's universe that the HBO show adapts--is not going to be part of it. He dropped out after Season 2, saying he wanted to focus on his work at Naughty Dog. Bella Ramsey, who plays Ellie on the show, has shared more insight into the series going ahead without one of its key creatives. Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter , Ramsey said that while Druckmann has exited the hit HBO show, he's not really gone because his world will live on. ""I think he left us in such good stead. And he still will always be a part of the fabric of it--it's literally his creation; the whole world. He's still there, even though he is not. So I think it will be fine,"" Ramsey said.

"Arc Raiders Continues To Be A Huge Hit, Reportedly Achieving These New Records","Arc Raiders was a breakout hit in 2025, and it's still growing. New data from Alinea Analytics states that the game enjoyed its biggest day ever on Sunday, January 4, when it came to daily active users. It was reported to have had 3.2 million daily active users on January 4 across platforms. Additionally, the research group said Arc Raiders passed 12 million copies sold over the weekend. The number of Arc Raiders copies sold daily began to ""stabilize"" in early December, but the recent 20%- off sale--which brought the price down to $32--along with a boost related to people being off from school and work for the holidays, helped pump up daily sales figures, the report said.

Arc Raiders Dev Defends Use Of AI Yet Again,"Arc Raiders was one of the most successful games of 2025, but it was also criticized for its use of AI-based text-to-speech systems . Patrick Söderlund, the head of Arc Raiders studio Embark, has now shed more light on the situation, saying the studio's goal in implementing AI into its development processes is to make better games more efficiently. He also pushed back against the idea that using AI systems in game development would lead to lower employment at Embark. ""We don't use AI to not have to hire people or replace people or job groups or voice actors,"" Söderlund told GamesBeat . ""People have to take a step back and understand what it is and how it can be a big help to developers and be a tremendous benefit to players. I realize it is an intricate subject and discussion.""

Arc Raiders Player Screaming For Help Gets Frantic Visit From Real-Life Neighbor,"Sometimes you get so into a game that you scream uncontrollably. Whether that be a curse word or an SOS, if you yell loud enough, someone will come to your rescue. At least that's what happened to one Arc Raiders player, whose door was kicked in by a concerned neighbor after he heard the player yelling for help. Redditor dreamthorp posted a 16-second clip of the incident on the Arc Raiders subreddit on January 3. They said they were playing a night raid on the Dam Battlegrounds, the game's very first map. While trying to extract from an elevator, a Leaper reportedly pounced on and downed them before the elevator doors shut. ""I just wanted to get stabilized so I could leave,"" dreamthorp said in the comments of their Reddit post. It's at this point that they started screaming, ""Somebody help me."" Well, somebody did come to help. As displayed on the door's Ring camera, a concerned neighbor walked over, knocked, and asked if they were ""all good."" Dreamthorp screamed for help again, at which point the concerned neighbor--a firefighter, according to dreamthorp--stepped back, assumed a stance, and kicked the door in, an action that allegedly corrupted the Ring camera's file.

"It's The Final Countdown For Anthem, With Only One Week Left To Play","Time is running out to play Anthem, BioWare's live-service game that originally launched in early 2019. In just one week, EA will take the online-multiplayer game offline, meaning it won't be playable starting January 12. EA officially announced that Anthem would be shut down in July 2025. This gave players roughly half-a-year to return to the RPG and to spend any leftover currency they had for the title. Eurogamer is looking at whether any sort of in-game event is planned to make the occasion, but that seems very unlikely at this point. After that announcement, former BioWare producer Mark Darrah discussed what went wrong with Anthem --at least from his point of view. For instance, Darrah noted that Mass Effect director Casey Hudson pitched Anthem to EA as a whole new direction for BioWare, but then Hudson left the studio and couldn't lead that proposed transformation. Hudson is now overseeing the team that's working on the recently revealed Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic . Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Code Vein II Tells A Time-Traveling Story That Will Tug On Your Heartstrings,"The souls-like genre has exploded in popularity since the dawn of From Software's Souls franchise, with multiple companies taking a stab at the format--and some companies taking multiple stabs. Bandai Namco, who publishes FromSoft's Souls games as well as Elden Ring, dropped an anime-style version of the genre in 2019's Code Vein, and now it's back for more in Code Vein II. We spent a few hours with the next Code Vein adventure during The Game Awards week, and we came away impressed with its improved combat system and a new and interesting take on the genre's ""summon"" mechanic, but what surprised us most was an original story that carries some emotional weight. The original Code Vein was a solid first effort, but Code Vein II shows that the franchise may have, pardon the pun, cracked the code. Code Vein II A new code Code Vein II takes place in a world on the edge of ruin, and where humans and Revenants, a human-like species of beings with vampiric abilities, live amongst one another. Our demo picks up in the present, as the effects of the Resurgence--a cataclysmic event that slowly morphs Revenants into mindless beasts--are wreaking havoc on the world.

Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora Got A Major Player-Count Boost After Fire And Ash,"Over two years after its release, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is enjoying an all-time peak on Steam, likely in large part due to the game's new DLC that ties in directly to the film franchise's latest installment. Data from SteamDB showed that the Ubisoft-published open-world game hit a record number of 15,283 players this week--a gain from its previous peak of 12,496 players last month when Avatar: Fire and Ash hit cinemas on December 19. With the release of the movie came a DLC expansion for Frontiers of Pandora on the same day --titled From the Ashes, the story expansion takes place weeks after the events of Fire and Ash and is thematically linked to the film. The DLC costs $25, though a From the Ashes edition of the game that includes the base game retails for $40. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Would You Like To Play More Saw Video Games? Lionsgate Wants You To,"Fans have had over 20 years of the Saw franchise, and John Wick is already celebrating over 10 years, with a fifth installment possibly on the way. Saw has become a contemporary iconic horror series that has spun off into a slew of merchandise, had its own Halloween Horror Nights house, and even a video game back in 2009 and its sequel. While Wick doesn't have the level of crossover appeal--though both Wick and Jigsaw's puppet have appeared in Fortnite --Lionsgate is looking to take both Jigsaw and Wick into video games for a new generation. On a recent earnings call, Lionsgate chairman Adam Fogelson mentioned that there is ""increased interest and increased opportunity"" to make new AAA games based on Lionsgate IPs. Fogelson specifically mentioned Wick and Saw. ""Our AAA game opportunities and other gaming opportunities around John Wick and Saw and some others that we'll be announcing soon, we're seeing increased interest and increased opportunity, and we remain on schedule,"" he said (via Seeking Alpha ). ""So I think in totality, you are going to see a meaningfully additive financial opportunity coming in the coming years."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Dev Doesn't Just Want To Be People-Pleaser With Next Game,"To say Sandfall Interactive has gained a few fans after releasing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 would be a wild understatement. In fact, the RPG wasn't just GameSpot's Game of the Year , but also made history at The Game Awards . This all means expectations will be sky high for the developer's next project. However, Sandfall wants to avoid appealing to the masses and continue focusing on ""what we think is cool."" Speaking with Edge magazine , Sandfall lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen noted that ""it's always in the back of my mind that we have a lot of fans now, and they have certain expectations and certain feelings toward the game."" The goal for the team is to avoid that noise. ""Creatively, we've always let our North Star be our own personal taste in terms of what we think is cool--what it is we enjoy and want to see. I've seen too many TV shows and books be swayed trying to please a lot of people, and in the process you end up losing the heart of what's there,"" Svedberg-Yen said. ""So [we] feel like we need to trust our instincts and continue to trust the vision behind the studio."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"

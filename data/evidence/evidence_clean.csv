Coordination with others is less of an immediate issue than it was, so even playing with random players is no longer a chore. Read more"

Skate Story review,"It's been almost twenty years since I lived in New York City, but there's something sorcerous about meeting art that can so fiercely resurrect such a deeply personal time and place for an audience of one. Skate Story is one of these experiences; and for even more reasons, it's easily an all-timer of a game. Sure, my hands are two rigid claws, my pre-arthritic joints are flaring up like a Guy Fawkes bonfire. My janky left shoulder is twinging, as it does when I get caught up doing computery things, and my heart is beating in the heels of my palms from deathgripping my controller. Frankly, this is just how movement-intense, combo-centric gaming feels when you're not a svelte, well-oiled machine anymore. I'm a desk jockey made of SSRIs and pain, and I must skate. Read more"

While all three games in the series were originally released as standalone digital editions between 2018 and 2023, they were recently collected into the physical The Turok Trilogy Bundle, which launched for PS5 and Nintendo Switch on October 31.

"Diablo 4: Lord Of Hatred Brings Back Everyone's Favorite ""Hot Mom,"" Amazons, And Lorath","After two and a half years, eleven seasons, and one massive, game-changing expansion, Diablo 4's Age of Hatred is finally coming to a close. Announced as part of 2025's The Game Awards, Diablo 4's next expansion, Lord of Hatred, marks the end of the game's ongoing saga--one which has seen Lilith, Inarius, Mephisto, and the humans of Sanctuary engage in an epic struggle to gain control of the world and its future. But while the upcoming expansion promises a ""satisfying"" conclusion and an ""epic, final showdown"" with the game's big bad, Mephisto, it also promises a number of other exciting features, too. Prior to the expansion's announcement, GameSpot, IGN, and PC Gamer were invited to attend an exclusive interview with two key members of Lord of Hatred's narrative team: lead narrative designer Matt Burns and narrative designer Eleni Rivera. The pair were eager to answer our questions about Lord of Hatred, even those that were, admittedly, both thirsty and bizarre. We left the Q&A session with a better understanding of Mephisto's plans, the lore behind the revamped Paladin class, and the Skovos Isles, as well as a great deal of anticipation--anticipation for more personality-filled dialogue options, plenty of ""Jedi mind tricks,"" and the return of Amazons, Lilith, and Ralph Ineson's velvety voice. IGN: Vessel of Hatred felt like you guys were holding your breath. Was that a Band-Aid or a part of the story that you always wanted to tell? I'm sure you guys heard a little bit of the feedback that Vessel of Hatred was good and also felt like it was teasing out of the showdown that we were all really waiting for. I'm wondering how much of that was planned versus you guys just taking longer to produce this big showdown. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Lost Sega Channel Games Saved In Latest VGHF Project,"Over 140 ROMs from Sega's long defunct Sega Channel, including service-exclusive games that were thought lost to time and never-before-published prototypes, have now been recovered thanks to the latest efforts of the Video Game History Foundation. Sega Channel launched in 1994 and was one of the first subscription-based, digital game services, beaming new games and content directly to players' consoles through a television cable. The service shut down in 1998, and since then many of the exclusive games and content available on the service were thought to be gone forever. That is, until the Video Game History Foundation embarked on a quest to see the channel's unique history, and its content, preserved. Alongside former Sega Channel VP of programming Michael Shorrock and a passionate Sega fan who had acquired a collection of Sega Channel backup tapes, VGHF sought to tell the full story of the Sega Channel.

Preorders for the It: Welcome to Derry Limited Edition Steelbook sold out within an hour at Amazon , but you can still secure a copy for $40 at Gruv . We also expect Walmart to open preorders soon. If you're a Stephen King fan, it'd probably be wise to preorder ASAP. Steelbook Editions of the two-part It film adaptation sold out fast, and Welcome to Derry is the first TV series based on a Stephen King novel to get a 4K Blu-ray edition. At this time, the Limited Edition Steelbook is the only way to get the series on 4K Blu-ray. Welcome to Derry: Season 1 is available to stream in full on HBO Max . Alternatively, you can buy Season 1 on other streaming platforms like Amazon Prime Video for $22 . Welcome to Derry holds an 80% on Rotten Tomatoes , and I think many longtime fans of King's legendary horror novel would say Season 1 was pretty great. HBO has yet to renew the series for a second season, but director Andy Muschietti has a three-season arc in mind. Season 1 tells the story of Pennywise's reign of terror in 1962. Season 2 would rewind the clock 27 years to Pennywise's previous feeding cycle in 1935, and Season 3 would be set in 1908. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
New Assassin's Creed Shadows Update Will Add Some Truly Grisly Finishers,"You would think stabbing a foe with a sword was enough.

It's pretty gnarly, and it's part of title update 1.1.7, which is planned to start arriving December 16. On the Ubisoft website , the patch notes highlight the bloody new finishers, saying they ""bring more flair to your encounters."" The official Assassin's Creed account on YouTube shared a video--seen below--showcasing the gruesome maneuvers for Naoe and Yasuke.

Ubisoft says that frame rate issues have been addressed, along with ""various visual issues."" However, this title update will come a day later, December 17, on Switch 2.

One Of Steam's Most-Wishlisted Games Gets A Movie Deal Before It's Even Out,"Yet another video game is getting a movie deal, as a report today states that Netflix has bought a movie idea for a film based on the upcoming game Kingmakers. For anyone unaware, Kingmakers is an action-strategy game set in medieval times that allows players to use AK-47s, grenade launchers, and attack helicopters in battle. The game is developed by Redemption Road Games and published by tinyBuild. It was due to launch in October this year before being delayed indefinitely due to its ""incredibly ambitious"" setup. Kingmakers is among the top five most-wishlisted games on Steam . So far, it's only been announced for PC. Deadline reported that Netflix bought a movie pitch for the game, with writer Christopher MacBride (Flashback, The Conspiracy) attached to write the script. The report added that Stranger Things director Shawn Levy's production company, 21 Laps, is producing the Kingsmakers movie, while Story Kitchen's Dmitri M. Johnson, Michael Lawrence Goldberg, and Timothy L. Stevenson are also producing. Story Kitchen is also behind the Sonic movie series, along with the upcoming Tomb Raider and Life is Strange TV shows, among other gaming projects. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Diablo 4 Paladin First Impressions: Much More Than A Diablo 2 Copycat,"Paladin is finally playable in Diablo 4 , and after a weekend with the ARPG's newest class, it's clear the holy-magic wielding warrior is a force to be reckoned with and more than just a copycat of its Diablo 2 counterpart, even if I personally wished it leaned into its namesake a little more. After two and a half years of waiting, Blizzard shadowdropped Paladin for Diablo 4 during a reveal for the game's new Lord of Hatred expansion at The Game Awards . Preordering the expansion grants early access to the Paladin, with the full expansion also set to add a second, still unannounced class. Diablo 4's Paladin is a fascinating mix of old and new. While the class bears the Paladin name from Diablo 2 , it arguably shares just as much, if not more, in common with the Crusader from Diablo 3 , with a number of similar abilities and over-the-top holy magic. Taken all together, the Diablo 4 Paladin is a new concotion combining two different flavors of light-slinging, with a splash of originality tossed in for good measusre. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Marathon Release Timing And Price Announced,"Bungie's new game, Marathon , will launch in March 2026, priced at $40 USD.

These Four Bleach Characters Are Coming To Fortnite This Week,"Epic Games loves collaborating with anime series for Fortnite , and it's no mystery why to anybody who's been constantly battling Gokus, Narutos, Gojos and All Mights in Battle Royale for years. Anime skins are clearly popular, so it makes sense that more are coming. Next up is Bleach, the beloved show that began in the 2004, and which is currently running a revival series to finish telling the manga's story, called Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War. This first collaboration with Bleach will, according to posters that have been spotted in the wild , include four skins: Ichigo Kurosaki, Rukia Kuchiki, Orihime Inoue, and Uryu Ishida. And presumably at least one gigantic sword. Message received. I can feel it. Something is coming… pic.twitter.com/wpifS7zyvD — Fortnite (@Fortnite) December 14, 2025 We have no further details about the collab, which has only been teased by Epic rather than fully revealed. But since this collab will be released during the holidays and Fortnite's Winterfest event, there's a decent chance there will be some kind of Bleach component added to Battle Royale, Blitz Royale, or Reload, since Fortnite has included tons of mythic weapons and powers based on anime series in the past--particularly at the end of the year.

The patch notes also point to a laundry list of bug fixes and balancing adjustments. The Spooky update was initially ""going to be a small Halloween update,"" according to Vedinad on Steam . That checks out, per the free DLC's name, but the developer added the desire ""to make it a bit bigger."" As such, the update is arriving for the festive season, with the Megabonk account on X promising a ""new meta."" Megabonk launched in September, sharing similarities with Vampire Survivors and Risk of Rain. It's a roguelike game where you do your best to survive against an onslaught of enemies on randomized maps. While doing so, you level up and find various items. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Exodus Is Using Matthew McConaughey's Real Voice, Not AI","Last month, Matthew McConaughey became one of the most prominent actors to endorse artificial intelligence by signing a deal with AI company ElvenLabs that will allow it to utilize his voice. McConaughey is also lending his voice to Exodus , an upcoming sci-fi title from BioWare veterans at Archetype Entertainment. But given the timing of McConaughey's new deal, Archetype co-founder Chad Robertson wants players to know that the actor really is lending his voice to the game. ""Everything that's in Exodus ... is bespoke VO recording just for us,"" Robertson told Eurogamer . ""He has a completely separate deal of his own design that he's worked out with Elevenlabs, which happens to be one of the most prominent, AI voice-generation tools, that is being used by other video game companies. Such that people could leverage his voice in non-bespoke VO sessions in a different way. He has a bunch of really strict rules around how it could be used."" Robertson went on to note that Archetype is not using generative AI in the production of its game, but added that using it in the future is a possibility under the right circumstances.

Call Of Duty Movie - Everything We Know About The Activision/Paramount Film,"A Call of Duty movie is now in the works at Paramount with big names attached to write and direct. It's been a long time coming, as Activision first announced plans for a Call of Duty movie--and an entire universe of Call of Duty films--more than a decade ago. But now the project is progressing. In this post, we're rounding up everything we know about the Call of Duty movie. We'll update this post in the future as more details are divulged. What is the Call of Duty movie about? This is one of the biggest questions people have about the Call of Duty movie, and we don't yet have an answer. In the original announcement, Paramount and Activision said they were ""committed to honoring the brand's rich narrative and distinctive style,"" going on to promise an ""authentic and exciting experience"" that can appeal to longtime fans and newcomers. These are marketing buzzwords and don't tell us much of anything about what the Call of Duty movie will actually be. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
President Of France Takes A Turn Congratulating Clair Obscur: Expedition 33,"The accolades keep rolling in for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.

Star Wars: Fate Of The Old Republic - Everything We Know So Far,"At The Game Awards, Lucasfilm and Mass Effect veteran Casey Hudson announced a brand-new Star Wars game called Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic . It was one of the biggest, most unexpected reveals from the event, and people are pretty hyped for it. The game is in early development and still a long way off ( but reportedly due before 2030 ), and there is plenty we still don't know about pretty much all facets of the game. But for now, here's what we know so far about Fate of the Old Republic. We will continue to update this post as more details become available. Table of Contents [ hide ] When will Fate of the Old Republic be released? When will Fate of the Old Republic be released? Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic does not have a release date. Immediately following the game's announcement, people theorized that the game was a long way off, in part because Hudson only just started the studio making the game, Arcanaut, back in July 2025. His previous studio, Humanoid Origin, opened in May 2021 and closed in December 2024; the studio never released a game. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Tomb Raider Actor Shares Her Heartfelt Farewell To Lara Croft,"At The Game Awards , the future of Tomb Raider was revealed in the form of two new games, and a new actor, Alix Wilton Regan, taking over the role of Lara Croft . Now, Camilla Luddington--who voiced Lara in the 2013 Tomb Raider reboot, Rise of the Tomb Raider , and Shadow of the Tomb Raider --has shared her farewell to Lara as well as a nod to her successor.

"Star Wars Fate Of The Old Republic Director Says The Game Will Launch Within The Next 1,477 Days","Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic was one of the big highlights of The Game Awards last week, but will it launch before 2030 ? Game director Casey Hudson has stepped in to address these reports-- which may stem from Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier's speculation about when the game will be released -- confirming that the spiritual successor to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic will arrive before the current decade is up. ""Don't worry about the 'not till 2030' rumors,"" Hudson wrote online . ""Game will be out before then. I'm not getting any younger!"" There's no concrete release date yet for Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, and it's still very early days for the project. The reveal trailer at The Game Awards was a CGI teaser for the game-- similar to how Quantic Dreams revealed Star Wars Eclipse at The Game Awards 2021 --and the developer behind Fate of the Old Republic is Arcanaut Studios, a company founded by Hudson and his partners in July. While it's not impossible, properly staffing a new studio and developing a game expected to be a AAA Star Wars experience will be challenging. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

It was featured in Amazon's Cyber Monday sale for $80. For the best value, check out The James Bond Collection , a 24-film Blu-ray box set for only $55 (was $120)--the same deal offered during Cyber Monday. Lastly, The Daniel Craig 5-Film 4K Blu-ray Collection is available for $38, which is only three bucks higher than its Black Friday price.

Unlike some budget-friendly box sets with a ton of movies, every film in The James Bond Collection is on a separate Blu-ray disc. The movies alone would be a bargain at this price, but The James Bond Collection also comes with over 120 hours of special features. The discs are packaged in a slipcase with three oversized plastic cases. The box comes with a white slipcover featuring each of the six James Bond actors in their title card poses. The only Bond movie from the Eon Productions catalog not featured in this box set is Daniel Craig's final appearance as 007, the 2021 film No Time to Die.

This is the only one of the three box sets that still comes with digital copies of the movies, but unlike the Daniel Craig Collection, it does not include standard Blu-ray discs. The films were restored in native 4K (2160p) resolution from the original camera negatives. All six movies support Dolby Vision and HDR10 as well as three audio formats: Dolby Atmos, Dolby TrueHD 7.1, and DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 Mono.

The PS5 and Xbox editions are up for grabs for $50, which is the all-time low for those platforms, too. Considering the two-game collection launched October 30, we wouldn't expect the $40 deals to remain in stock for long. You can complete the original trilogy by picking up Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake for $35 on Switch 1/2 or PS5 ; the Xbox edition is a few bucks cheaper at Amazon. The $35 deal matches Amazon's Black Friday price. Fans should also check out Amazon's 50% discount on the hardcover art book Dragon Quest Illustrations . Dragon Quest I & II HD-2D Remake (Switch 1/2, PS5, Xbox) $40 (was $60) Like all Square Enix games for Switch 2 so far, the Nintendo Switch 2 version is a Game-Key Card that requires a 17GB download. If this bothers you, the Nintendo Switch version has the full game on the card and is fully playable on Nintendo's new console. Dragon Quest I & II HD-2D Remake earned favorable reviews from critics; it holds an 84 Metascore on GameSpot sister site Metacritic. Just like Square's other HD-2D remakes, the first two Dragon Quest games look and run beautifully on all platforms. The updated visuals are bolstered by the new orchestral soundtrack. Square Enix implemented a bevy of welcome gameplay changes to give players more customization options. You'll also find new dungeons, meet new characters, and watch a more cohesive story unfold between the two games and DQIII. The first game is still a solo adventure for the Hero, but a new playable character in the sequel gives you the chance to have a ""modern four-member party. If you're in the mood for a couple of thoroughly retro turn-based RPGs that don't feel like a full-time job, this collection is well-worth checking out.

Dragon Quest I & II HD-2D Remake completed Square Enix's Erdrick Trilogy--also known as Roto/Loto Trilogy--remake project that started last year with Dragon Quest III. The remakes were released in this order, because the third numbered entry actually takes place before DQ1.

Dragon Quest III was the first entry in the series to feature a job system and emphasize working alongside your companions as a true party.

"The 50 best games of 2025, ranked","It's been another strange, difficult, and yet somehow also brilliant year for video games in 2025. Triple-A releases have been sparse again, compared to the boom times of old, with a great big GTA 6 -shaped hole left in the final few months of the year. And yet once again, every gap left by the established order has been filled twice over with something brilliantly new. Read more"

"Eurogamer readers' top 50 games of 2025 - ""It made me cry three times""","2025 has gone by in a flash, hasn't it? Well, apart from the days I've spent tabulating all your Game of the Year votes and presenting the results here - that has felt like an eternity and I think has given me permanent neck pain. But, let's not worry about that. I'm sure you'll agree it was worth the sacrifice. Read more"

"Despite a load of great games in 2025, No Man's Sky is the happy place that keeps drawing me back in again","If we're plotting out the year based on unexpected obsessions, mine were (in no particular order) weird Italian genre cinema of the 60s and 70s, an unhealthy appetite for unnecessarily elaborate physical media collector's editions, folk horror in literally any form I could consume, and, apparently, No Man's Sky . According to Steam's usual end-of-year thing, the exploratory space sim is by far my most played game of 2025, accounting for - somewhat incredibly - nearly 20 percent of my total playtime.

"Penises set Dispatch apart, and I mean that quite sincerely","I think a lot of Dispatch can be distilled into a single moment at the beginning of the game when the player comes face to face with a penis. There it is, dangling visibly between the legs of an unclothed, toxic-drenched super-villain you're about to fight. The camera all but centers on it. There's no way you can miss it unless you've flipped the nudity switch off, in which case it's replaced by an even more conspicuous black box that only amplifies the naughtiness of the part hidden within. But most people don't turn nudity off because they're expecting boobs. That's what we usually see. In Dispatch, however, it's a penis we see waggling unavoidably on our screens. Read more"
"Donkey Kong Bananza might not be the best game of the year, but it's surely the one I loved the most","I think these days, after years of Nintendo outright eschewing the console power rat race and focusing instead on different ways to play and honing their core craft, we forget that Nintendo is still a pretty sharp company in terms of technical innovation. Raw power went aside with the Wii, but the company's dedication to tinkering around the edges to create stand-out original experiences in other ways remained - or perhaps even intensified. There's been a lot of examples over the years, of course, from clever game design innovations to zany peripherals - but Donkey Kong Bananza has to be one of the finest showcases of that thinking from Nintendo in years.

"Despelote showed me the year's greatest intro sequence, and its greatest advert for video games full stop","I'm going to spoil the opening of Despelote here - an opening which I think, as you can probably tell, is pretty glorious. It's not a spoiler so much as a contaminator, a finger on the scales of something it'll feel wonderful to go into unweighted. So go away right now if you want to experience it for yourself.

"In 2025, Deltarune reminded me of the joy and importance of secret hunting","A guide writer talking about how her favourite gaming related moment of 2025 was uncovering secrets? Who saw that coming… Seriously though, let me tell you about a little downside of my job: if we're covering a game, or considering doing so, I have to spoil everything for myself for planning purposes. End-game boss? Spoiled. Every collectible location and what happens after you've collected every magic hat or whatever? Spoiled. Plot twists, because I might as well go all in at this point? Spoiled. If I don't learn it before the game comes out, I'll certainly know about it shortly after release thanks to research. (I learned what happened to Zelda in Tears of the Kingdom via Google Trends. Google bloody Trends .) Read more"
Skin Deep was this year's reminder that it's a privilege to recognise a developer's handwriting,"Out in space there are objects that orbit one another for so long, and at such a stately pace, that when they both eventually arrive at the same point, they don't collide with some kind of awful explosion. Instead, they just touch. They graze. They fuse. It's all very gentle. And then, over time, the two objects become one. Read more"
"In 2025, Winter Burrow showed how a little kindness goes a long way","In a loud world where everyone is battling to be heard, it's easy to forget that the quiet and smaller moments of kindness hold the most power. A lot of the time, it's easy to think that keeping to yourself is the easiest way to deal with things, whether you're dealing with your own pain or trying to find the right way to navigate someone else's. It's never easy to know what to do, we're all trying our best - after all this is all our first time being human. But one truth remains:a little kindness goes a long way. Winter Burrow, the intrepid little mouse game, shows this more than anything else I've played in 2025. Read more"

Eurogamer's Alternate Game Awards 2025,"The year is over! Or near enough. Sound the refrain that has become all too familiar over the last few years: What a: year for videogames/nightmare/success/disaster. This might be the only time on Eurogamer I can get away with using the old cliche 'mixed bag', hey. As everyone else is putting their minds together to come up with awards in a range of arbitrary categories, we thought it was only right that we did the same in celebration of this strange old year and some of the great, funny, wild, stupid, and bad things that have happened in it - with our tongue firmly planted in our cheek.

How I learned to stop worrying and love the anime horse racing game,"Of all the games released this year, all the triple-A blockbusters and genre-defining smash hits, nothing shook me as much as Umamusume: Pretty Derby.

It is fair to say it is a beloved title, and at this year's The Game Awards, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 made history becoming the most awarded game of all time . It scooped up a record nine accolades, including the coveted Game of the Year. Read more"

Blades of Fire and Hideo Kojima showed me I can still be surprised by a video game and that originality is essential,"I am pretty confident in my ability to judge video games. I've been playing them (increasingly badly over more recent years!) for almost 40 years and writing about them for over 20, so it's rare that something blindsides me. But that's exactly what happened with Blades of Fire , the action soulslike adventure from Mercury Steam. I loved the studio's Castlevania rethink, Lords of Shadow, but was so-so on its output since, including the Nintendo-published Metroid Dread . My expectations for Blades of Fire were low to moderate. Incredible, then, that I've not played another game released this year that I enjoyed more. Read more"

Viture Luma Pro XR Glasses For Switch 2 On Sale For $75 Off,"Viture Luma Pro XR Glasses $424 (was $499) | Free 8BitDo Ultimate 2C See at Amazon Viture Pro Mobile Dock $99 (was $129) | Free Switch or Switch 2 Mount See at Amazon The Viture Luma Pro XR Glasses are back on sale at Amazon for the same price we saw during Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales last holiday season.

Lego Lord Of The Rings Book Nook Gets First Discount At Amazon,"Lego Icons: Lord of the Rings - Balrog Book Nook (1,201 Pieces) $117 (was $130) See at Amazon Lord of the Rings fans can save on Lego's Balrog Book Nook for the first time at Amazon. Released last June, the 1,201-piece Lord of the Rings building set is on sale for $117 (was $130). While it's only a 10% discount, deals on Lord of the Rings Lego models are exceedingly rare. The LOTR Book Nook can wedge between your various collectible editions of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit to add a fun flourish to your Tolkien shelf. Or you can open the Book Nook and display the buildable Balrog figure alongside your other Lego sets. Lego Icons: Lord of the Rings - Balrog Book Nook (1,201 Pieces) $117 (was $130) Lego picked a rather fitting scene from The Lord of the Rings for the brick-built Book Nook. The 1,201 piece model is based on Gandalf the Grey's battle with Durin's Bane in the movie adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring. Once fully built, the frame resembles the stone pillars and archways of the First and Second Halls in the Mines of Moria. The buildable stand for the Gandalf the Grey minifigure represents the narrowest point on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm. With the Book Nook closed, as shown above, the model is 5.5 x 6.5 x 9 inches and captures the moment Gandalf confidently blocks the Balrog's path and exclaims, ""You shall not pass!"" The memorable line of dialogue is quoted on the Book Nook's front plaque. Lego Gandalf wields his signature staff in one hand and Glamdring (his sword) in the other. The buildable Balrog figure is essentially an articulated action figure, because you can pose his wings, arms, hands, legs, and fingers. Balrog comes with a whip accessory, and flame elements attach to his back. Lego used flexible sheets of translucent plastic to make the wings. It's only been included with one other Lego set: the 269-piece Fell Beast, which was a purchase bonus Lego Insiders when the massive Barad-dûr building set launched in 2024. You can disconnect the bridge from each side to open the Book Nook. This alternate display mode showcases the Balrog's imposing presence with its wings fully unfurled. Flame elements decorate the left and right archways, which is a reference to the Balrog of Moria's ability to start a fire by flapping its wings. With the Book Nook fully unfolded, the wider model is 17.5 x 6.5 x 9 inches. Since neither the Balrog figure or Gandalf minifigure need to be connected to the frame, you can display them without the Lego Book Nook, too.

Detective Pikachu 4K Steelbook Edition Is Only 20 Bucks At Amazon,"Pokemon Detective Pikachu Steelbook Edition (4K Blu-ray) $20.49 (was $33) See at Amazon See at Gruv ($28) See at Walmart ($31) Pokemon fans can catch a great deal on Detective Pikachu's Limited Edition Steelbook at Amazon. Normally $33, the collectible 4K Blu-ray edition is on sale for only $20.49. The discount probably won't stick around for too long, and it's worth noting this edition has sold out multiple times since its release last April. The 2025 Steelbook Edition is also in stock at Gruv ($28) and Walmart ($31) , but Amazon is the only retailer offering the substantial discount. Detective Pikachu originally released on Blu-ray back in 2019. At the time, Best Buy had an exclusive edition with a steelbook case. Outside of overpriced listings on eBay and other marketplaces, the original steelbook is long gone. The 2025 Steelbook Edition's design is based on one of the Pikachu posters used to promote the theatrical release. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Fortnite Quests For Chapter 7 Season 1: How To Earn Lots Of XP And All Free Cosmetics,"A new season of Fortnite means a whole new slate of quests to help you grind your way through the battle pass--and you're gonna need it, because progression through the Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 battle pass is slower than it was during Simpsons season. With these quests to give you a boost, and with this guide to help you get through those quests as quickly as possible, you'll have those superstyles unlocked in no time. Relatively speaking. Meanwhile, Fortnite's crossover with South Park is now in full swing, and it came with a free event pass and quests that will net you three account levels' worth of XP. You can read about those South Park quests here . Let's take a look at the quests. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"RAM Shortages May Lead To More Expensive TVs And Devices, Warns Samsung","The increasing demand for AI among tech companies is one of the reasons why the global shortage of memory chips remains an ongoing issue. And while it's expected to adversely affect the production of smartphones, Samsung Electronics co-CEO T M Roh has warned that TVs and home appliances may also be hit by shortages and increased prices. ""As this situation is unprecedented, no company is immune to its impact,"" said Roh via Reuters . According to the report, Roh noted that TVs and home appliances will also feel the pinch from the shortages and he didn't rule out price hikes to compensate for them. Samsung is the biggest manufacturer of TVs in the world, and Roh said it the impact of the RAM shortages will be ""inevitable."" The rise in consumer-electronic prices would also throw a large wrench in Microsoft's ongoing ""This Is an Xbox"" strategy, as smart TVs, including those made by Samsung, are among the growing list of platforms capable of playing Game Pass titles.

How To Get Into The Arc Raiders Locked Gate On Blue Gate,"Various map events in Arc Raiders provide unique challenges for players to tackle, including those with built-in requirements for accessing some extra good items. One of these is the Locked Gate event on Blue Gate, which tasks the lobby with finding four codes to unlock a massive gate housing underground tunnels full of loot. Like Spaceport's Hidden Bunker event , this one will take some exploration and time to unlock, so let's dive into how it all works. Table of Contents [ hide ] How to open the locked gate on Blue Gate How to open the locked gate on Blue Gate To open the locked gate during the Locked Gate event, players in the lobby must find four security codes in four specific places on the Blue Gate map. There is one security code in each of the following POIs: Ancient Fort Pilgrim's Peak Raider's Refuge Reinforced Reception You need to find the security codes at these locations. Once you arrive at one of these POIs, loot every container there until you or another player finds that location's code, then move to the next POI. Do your best to work together with other players in the lobby to prevent unnecessary overlap--meaning that if you see someone else, always ask if they've found one of the codes, or offer to split up and find codes at different POIs to keep things moving efficiently.

How To Open Security Breach Lockers In Arc Raiders,"Arc Raiders is all about looting and shooting your way through a map and hoping to make it back home safely to Speranza. Every moment counts, and every container in the game could end up having that item that makes all the stress of the run worth it. So, it makes sense you may be disappointed to come across a Security Breach locker you can't open. Anything at all could be in there just waiting for you to take it home, right? Well, you might need to put in some time to make it happen, but here's how you can get to opening Security Breach lockers in Arc Raiders. How to open Security Breach lockers in Arc Raiders Before you'll be able to open any Security Breach lockers you stumble across, you'll first need to buy the aptly-named Security Breach skill from the skill tree. You can access the skill tree by selecting Raider > Skill Tree while in Speranza. The Security Breach skill is in the Survival path of the skill tree. The Security Breach skill is the final node in the Survival (red) path on the right of the skill tree. To unlock this skill, you'll need to place at least 36 points into the Survival path, which is a hefty investment. We'll get into whether it's worth it or not a bit further down.

"Sims Team Says ""Values Are Unchanged"" Ahead Of Potential Saudi EA Deal","Electronic Arts' $55 billion deal to sell itself to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and the private equity firm Silver Lake still has to receive regulatory approval before it's finalized. However, some Sims fans and creators have been concerned about how Saudi Arabi's potential control over the company will affect the inclusive nature of the experience. To alleviate those concerns, the developers behind The Sims franchise wants players to know their core values haven't been changed by this deal. ""The values of The Sims are unchanged,"" reads the statement on the franchise's official page . ""Our Sims team's creative control, guided by our values of inclusivity, choice, creativity, community, and play, has not changed. These values inspire the decisions we make each and every day as we plan for today, tomorrow, and the future."" Given Saudi Arabi's history of human rights abuses, the worried reactions from The Sims community appear to be understandable. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren have both raised their concerns about ""foreign influence"" on EA if the deal goes through. Subsequently, EA has asserted that it will retain creative control of the company following the sale. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Donkey Kong-Themed Wireless Controller With Lenticular Art Gets Massive Discount,"Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller: Donkey Kong Edition $41.61 (was $60) | $31.20 with coupon See at Amazon Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 owners can save big on officially licensed wireless controllers with eye-catching lenticular or glow-in-the-dark designs.

"This AI VTuber Just Beat A Huge Twitch Record, But It's Not Who You're Expecting","Sometimes, I feel like writing the same article four times could be considered a bit of a meme. But then I remember that this is a pretty phenomenal achievement for any streamer, let alone an AI VTuber. First Neuro-sama beat the Twitch Hype Train world record ... then it happened again . And again . This time around, her ""sister"" Evil Neuro, who has her own distinctive voice, model, and attitude, led the calls to beat the Hype Train record for a fourth time. In the process, she also helped her creator Vedal987 become the third-most-subscribed Twitch channel of all time. After becoming the third most-subscribed channel, Vedal joined Evil on stream to ask his community to ""Give it a rest."" He added, ""In all seriousness chat, you have given me and the twins more than we need, so it's okay."" Evil wasn't happy with this though, retorting, ""No Vedal! Please can we raise the timer, just a little bit? Don't you think it's a bit cruel to just cut it off here?"" Evil was referring to the timer that's currently running for Neuro's third birthday subathon, where each subscription gifted to the channel adds time to a countdown clock that determines when the stream will end. It has been running since December 19, 2025, and has around 22 hours left at the time of writing. Regardless, shortly afterwards the Hype Train did come to an end at level 72--although not a fourth world record, it's still a hugely impressive achievement, and leaves Vedal's Twitch channel with more than 328,900 subscribers. It's hard to nail down an exact figure, since that number continues to rise as the community attempts to extend the subathon. What that does mean, however, is that Vedal, Neuro, and Evil have overtaken streamer Jasontheween and fellow VTuber Ironmouse 's positions as the third and fourth most-subscribed channels on Twitch . The only two channels that have ever beaten that achievement are Evelone2004 , with 459,924 subscribers, and KaiCenat with 1,112,947 subscribers. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Fortnite X South Park Quests: How To Ride 5 Rides At Cartmanland And Complete Every Quest,"During Fortnite Chapter 6, most every cosmetic you could unlock from a pass or for free was earned simply by gaining XP in any mode. But Epic has returned to the old ways in Chapter 7, with unlockable cosmetics that require completing specific quests. Case in point is the Born in Chaos mini pass for Fortnite's new South Park crossover , which comes with a series of quests that you'll need to complete in order to unlock the otherwise-free cosmetics. That means that if you want to get those Terrance and Phillip doll pickaxes, you'll actually need to pay attention to these quests. Some of them you'll certainly complete by accident if you play Fortnite regularly, but others will require a bit of conscious effort. And we'll make it just a smidge easier by handling the thinking part for you--which is to say that we'll explain each quest in detail below. All of these quests must be completed in Battle Royale or Zero Build, and they provide pass progress only. The quests themselves don't offer XP directly, but there are three level skips you can unlock as you progress the event pass, and you can already earn one of them (worth 80,000 XP) by completing five quests. Completing four quests from a batch will award a Memberberry--collecting six Memberberries awards the Imaginationland Airship glider. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Manor Lords Publisher Has Banned AI Assets In Its Games, Calls Them ""Cancerous""","The publisher behind strategy games Endless Legend 2, Terra Invicta, and Against the Storm has officially banned the use of AI-generated assets in all its products. Hooded Horse has had a significant presence in the strategy game space over the last few years, thanks to hits like Manor Lords. Now, when many publishers and developers are evaluating (or touting) their relationship to generative AI, Hooded Horse is rebuking its use for art generation. Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender discussed the ban in an interview with Kotaku , emphasizing that restrictions on AI art are part of every contract Hooded Horse signs. He said, ""It is now written into our contracts if we’re publishing the game, 'no f**king AI assets.'"" He also expressed personal exasperation with how GenAI has made his job harder. He said, ""If I sound frustrated, it’s because, like, honestly, all this thing has done is made our lives more difficult."" This frustration comes from the fact that GenAI usage can be difficult to catch. Even if the intention is to use a generated asset only as a placeholder, those assets can easily make their way to the final product. ""We’ve gotten to the point where we also talk to developers and we recommend they don’t use any gen AI anywhere in the process,"" Bender elaborated. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Divinity Will Have Co-Op At Launch,"You will be able to play Divinity with your friends and family. Developer Larian Studios has confirmed co-op will be included for the RPG when it comes out, whenever that may be. During a Reddit AMA , Larian technical director Bert van Semmertier gave the thumbs-up to co-op in Divinity, stating that the feature ""will be available for release."" What's intriguing, however, was how the developer discussed how many people might be able to team up in the game. ""The amount of players playing together will be depending on the final party size,"" van Semmertier responded. ""But since modding is planned for this project as well, player[s] will be essentially free to extend this. There is no hard limit to the amount of co-op players."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"The Division 3 Is Gearing Up ""To Be A Monster,"" Says Series Executive Producer","Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment seem to be feeling pretty good about the development of Tom Clancy's The Division 3. Julian Gerighty, who oversees the franchise as executive producer, says the game is ""shaping up to be a monster."" In an interview at the New Game+ Showcase (via VGC ), Gerighty opened up just a bit about the next major installment in the online action-RPG series. ""The Division 3 is in production, right? This is not a secret; it's been announced,"" Gerighty said. ""It’s shaping up to be a monster."" In 2023, Ubisoft officially announced that The Division 3 was in development , so of course Gerighty is correct that it's not a confidential matter at this point. ""Within these walls at Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will have as big an impact as Division 1 was,"" Gerighty added. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Fortnite Now Lets Creators Publish Islands With In-Game Transactions,"Epic Games may have opened a can of worms by fully enabling developers in Fortnite Creative to implement in-game purchases into their experiences. Developer tools for in-game transactions were available in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) in a preview state since November, letting creators charge V-Bucks for digital items in their unpublished Fortnite Creative modes and games, or ""islands."" Epic Games has just flipped the switch, allowing for these islands to be published. The implementation of these developer tools for monetization in Fortnite Creative has raised complaints and worries, with players comparing this development to Roblox's revenue model. Concerns about pay-to-win practices and predatory microtransactions have emerged in Fortnite communities since Epic Games first announced its plans to implement this approach.

"Lawsuit Alleges Fortnite, Roblox Structurally Changed A Child’s Brain","Fortnite and Roblox have been named in a new lawsuit filed in San Francisco by a Louisiana mother who's alleging her child may have experienced structural brain changes due to prolonged exposure to online games. Descheca Jackson claims in the lawsuit brought to the US District Court for the Northern District of California on December 30 that her child, a minor only identified by the initials ""MA,"" has developed symptoms consistent with internet gaming disorder (IGD) since playing video games at a young age. This includes behavioral challenges such as her loss of impulse control, withdrawal symptoms, irritability, anxiety, and difficulty disengaging from gameplay. The lawsuit also alleges that MA suffered addiction, social isolation, depression, loss of friends and relationships, and damage to her grades, leading to ""an academic dismissal from school."" According to a February 2025 study reported on by About Lawsuits , IGD is described as a pattern in which gaming negatively impacts a person's daily activities, including school, work, relationships, and family life. The symptoms tend to include nonstop gaming, irritability when access to games is restricted, and continued use despite its negative consequences. The research suggests IGD affects one in 10 adolescent boys, with Minecraft and Roblox often the culprits of the disorder. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Larian Studios Draws Harder Line On AI, Clarifies Stance In Reddit AMA","Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke, as well as creative directors, recently participated in an AMA on Reddit to set expectations for the studio’s upcoming Divinity game , particularly about its stance on generative AI--a hot-button topic in the industry right now. Responding to a fan question about the role of generative AI in game development, Vincke was rather blunt: ""There is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity."" His comments arrive amid wider debate over how and whether AI should be used in creative processes, especially as some high-profile games have faced backlash for such use. One notable example is Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the acclaimed RPG that had two Indie Game Awards (including Game of the Year and Debut Game) rescinded when it was revealed the title had included AI-generated assets during development, violating strict no-AI rules--even though those assets were patched out later. In the AMA, Vincke acknowledged that previous discussions about experimenting with AI tools for concept-art had been confusing . To make its intentions clear, the studio has elected to avoid generative AI entirely in concept-art creation for Divinity. As Vincke put it, there should be no doubt about where the art came from.

Fire Emblem: Path Of Radiance Joins Switch Online’s GameCube Classics Library,"Ahead of the release of Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave later this year, Nintendo has added Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance to the Switch 2's library of GameCube classics. Regarded as one of the best entries in the entire franchise, Path of Radiance will be available for all Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers. First released in 2005, Path of Radiance earned critical acclaim for its dark storyline, mature themes, and for being the first 3D Fire Emblem game. Set on the fictional continent of Tellius, the game follows the mercenary Ike and his companions as they set out to rescue a princess and save the kingdom of Crimea from the invading nation of Daein. Like previous Fire Emblem games, Path of Radiance is a turn-based tactical RPG that features permadeath: Any character who falls in battle is permanently lost for the rest of the game. A sequel--Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn--was released for the Nintendo Wii in 2007. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Arc Raiders Dev Promises New Anti-Cheating Measures Are Coming Soon,"The extraction shooter Arc Raiders has proven to be one of the top hits of 2025, which has in turn attracted some unscrupulous players who aren't above cheating to win. After the rule-abiding Arc Raiders players became vocal about their displeasure, Embark Studios has announced that new anti-cheat measures are on their way to the game. ""We've seen the discussion around the topic of cheaters in Arc Raiders,"" reads the message shared on Arc Raiders' Discord server via PC Gamer . ""Please know that we are taking this issue very seriously and are listening to, and acting on your feedback. Over the next few weeks, we are implementing significant changes to our rulesets and deploying new detection mechanisms to identify and remove cheaters. This includes updating our Anti-Cheat systems for improved detection and bans, as well as applying client-side fixes specifically addressing the 'out of map glitch.' Furthermore, we are introducing tools for streamers to help mitigate stream sniping."" A firm timetable for the anti-cheat measures wasn't disclosed. However, Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund recently revealed that Arc Raiders has quietly introduced "" aggression-based matchmaking ."" Söderlund went on to clarify that matchmaking is still skill-based, but it will also match players ""based on how likely you are to engage in fights with fellow players.""

PUBG: Blindspot Is Heading To Early Access Next Month,"Nearly a year ago, Krafton launched the beta test for PUBG: Blindspot , the first-ever spin-off from PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (not counting PUBG Mobile). Now, Krafton has announced that Blindspot is getting an early-access release on February 5. This title differs from its predecessor by embracing a top-down perspective and focusing on 5v5 battles in a tactical showdown. Attacking teams are tasked with making their way through a building in order to break into a vault and install a device called the Decrypter. Specific weapons like grenade launchers and explosive hammers can break down the walls standing between the players and their goal. Defending players can set up barricades to slow down their adversaries, but these are battles that ultimately come down to gunplay. The newly released trailer shows off some of the improvements coming to the early-access build, including enhanced visuals and UI, as well as balance adjustments and control refinements. Krafton describes it as a ""launch-ready level of quality"" in support of ongoing development. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
This Star Wars Overhaul Mod Makes Starfield Really Fun To Play,"Starfield has had a somewhat divisive response from players since it debuted in 2023, but there is a Star Wars mod that transforms it into a more rewarding experience. The Star Wars: Genesis mod was released in 2024, but this year, it's adding lightsabers and a more immersive experience for Starfield PC players who want to take the plunge. Star Wars: Genesis was created by a modder who goes by DeityVengy, and it's available for free on Nexus Mods . The mod features an original story that's set between the prequel and original Star Wars trilogies. There is an update coming before the end of January that adds even more content to the mod, and DeityVengy showed off some of those new features in the video below. In the video, DeityVengy notes that using a lightsaber forces players into a first-person perspective because Starfield's melee animations weren't up to the challenge of depicting lightsaber combat. The story featured in this clip also focuses on the player's character confronting one of the Nightsisters of Dathomir before letting them decide whether to spare or slay her.

Donkey Kong Bananza Physical Edition Gets Rare Discount,"Donkey Kong Bananza Physical Edition $63 (was $70) See at Amazon See at Walmart Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller: Donkey Kong Edition $41.61 (was $60) | $31.20 with coupon See at Amazon Donkey Kong Bananza's physical edition is on sale for $63 (was $70) at Amazon and Walmart . The 10% discount discount matches the all-time best price for the Switch 2 exclusive's physical edition. And the last time Amazon discounted Bananza to $63 was in August, one week after launch. That deal disappeared fast, and we wouldn't be surprised if this one expires before the end of today (January 9). If you want to play the Switch 2 platformer with an appropriately themed controller, the Turtle Beach Rematch Donkey Kong-themed wireless controller is on sale for $41.61 (was $60), but you might be able to get it for only $31. Amazon is offering an extra 25% coupon discount to some customers. Released last fall, the officially licensed controller has lenticular artwork, two built-in back buttons, motion controls, and great ergonomics. Donkey Kong Bananza Physical Edition $63 (was $70) Developed by the team behind Super Mario Odyssey, Donkey Kong Bananza earned rave reviews, including a 9/10 from GameSpot . The 3D platformer has a 91 Metascore from critics and 9/10 from users on review aggregator Metacritic. It's currently the fourth highest-rated Switch 2 game based on Metascore. Only Hades II and Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom have higher ratings. Almost everything you see in Donkey Kong Bananza can be smashed with DK's fists. Bananza's large, colorful zones look great whether you're playing on a 4K TV or the Switch 2's 7.9-inch screen. Performance sometimes drops to 30fps during frenzied terrain destruction sequences, but Bananza targets, and often maintains, 60fps in docked and handheld modes. It's probably Nintendo's most impressive Switch 2 game from a technical perspective. The physical edition includes the full 8.9GB game file on the card, so you're saving a small chunk of storage space by opting for physical over digital. All Nintendo-published games available now have genuine physical editions. But this will change in March when Pokemon Pokopia launches with a Game-Key Card, meaning players will need to download Pokopia's 10GB data file from the eShop. The $63 deal is only at Amazon and Walmart . DK Bananza is price at $70 at Best Buy , Target , and GameStop as well as on the Switch eShop. See at Amazon See at Walmart For reference: Bananza has been priced slightly lower than $63 before, but that discount applied to the digital edition. During Amazon's Game Awards Sale last month, the digital edition was $59.49 and the bundle with the Emerald Rush DLC was $76.49. Those deals are long gone, though. Amazon also offered a $10 discount on the Donkey Kong & Pauline Amiibo around the same time, but that deal expired, too. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Save Over 50% On David Lynch's Dune Adaptation On 4K Blu-Ray,"David Lynch's Dune: Special Edition (4K Blu-ray) $21.80 (was $50) See at Amazon A Masterpiece in Disarray: David Lynch's Dune, An Oral History $20.50 (was $30) See at Amazon If you're a big fan of Frank Herbert's Dune and/or movies made by legendary director David Lynch , check out Amazon's deal on the 4K UHD restoration of the late filmmaker's highly ambitious and divisive 1984 adaptation. Arrow Video's stellar 4K Blu-ray edition of David Lynch's Dune is up for grabs for only $21.80 (was $50). Dune is one of many 4K Blu-rays in Amazon's 50% off Arrow Video movies promotion ; it's also not the only Dune adaptation on 4K Blu-ray for super cheap right now. Save over 50% on Dune 4K Blu-rays: David Lynch's Dune -- $21.80 ( $50 ) Dune: Prophecy Season 1 -- $17 ( $40 ) with coupon Dune: Part One -- $14.49 ( $30 ) Dune: Part Two -- $15 ( $30 ) The ultra-violent and often disorienting film was exceedingly unpopular with critics and fans, but it has garnered a cult following over the years. It's a fascinating adaptation that's worth revisiting, and Arrow Video's 4K Blu-ray edition is the best way to watch it today. If you're at all interested in Dune or David Lynch or the filmmaking process, I'd highly recommend pairing the 4K Blu-ray with the massive behind-the-scenes book titled A Masterpiece in Disarray: David Lynch's Dune, An Oral History . The 560-page, limited-edition book is thoroughly entertaining--and it doesn't hurt that it doubles as a stunning display piece. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Xbox Exclusive RPG Avowed Is Coming To PS5 With New Features,"Avowed , Obsidian's 2025 RPG originally released on Xbox Series X/S and PC, is coming to PlayStation 5.

Microsoft remains the game's publisher, having purchased Obsidian in 2018. The game, a first-person action RPG set in the world of Pillars of Eternity, tasks players with investigating a mysterious plague, fighting their way through a sprawling world with a mix of weapons and magic.

The PS5 version will also contain all post-release content and updates that the game has received thus far. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Overwatch 2 Season 20 Midcycle Introduces Showdown Shuffle,"The middle of Overwatch 2 Season 20 has arrived, and the midcycle is bringing the chaos with new modes, new loot, and new in-game collectibles. One of the most notable new additions is Showdown Shuffle, which runs January 13-26. This mode is going to change which character you're controlling, often at random intervals. Showdown Shuffle locks players into a role, but not a particular hero. Instead, hero swaps can occur when players reach certain milestones for kills or assists, or even when players are eliminated. According to Blizzard, this was done to encourage players to experiment with new characters and adapt on the fly. Showdown Shuffle will be a 5v5 battle available in Control, Hybrid, Escort, Push, and Flashpoint. Match modifiers will also change throughout the battle for more unpredictable outcomes. Starting today through January 11, Assault will return during a Quick Play Hacked event that brings back classic Overwatch maps Temple of Anubis, Hanamura, and Volskaya Industries. It's a fitting start the year, considering that 2026 will mark the 10th anniversary of Overwatch. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Rockstar's Battle With Union Over Fired Devs Goes To Court,"Near the end of October 2025, Rockstar fired over thirty devs in the United Kingdom and Canada over what it called ""gross misconduct."" The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain accused Rockstar of union busting for laying off workers who were organizing with the union. Both sides have held firm since the initial accusations, and now the battle has gone to court in the UK. As reported by Video Games Chronicle , Rockstar and the IWGB went before the court earlier this week, where the latter requested that the fired workers be given ""interim relief"" while the legal drama plays out. If granted, that would place the affected workers back on Rockstar's payroll and allow some to keep their visas that were reliant on their jobs. The court will reportedly decide on the matter before the end of the week. The IWGB pledged to continue fighting for the workers regardless of the court's decision, while Rockstar reiterated its position that the workers broke the company's policy.

New Switch 2 Joy-Cons Are Here And They're Extremely Underwhelming,"Nintendo has revealed its first set of new Joy-Con controllers for the Nintendo Switch 2 and I'll be honest, I'm a bit disappointed. To be clear, I'm not disappointed (or surprised) by the $100 price tag, as the original Switch Joy-Cons are still $90, the standard Switch 2 Joy-Cons are $100, and all gaming hardware is pretty expensive right now. No, it's not the cost that bothers me, but rather how little these new Joy-Cons differentiate themselves from the pair that already exist. Similar to the original Switch's Joy-Cons, it appears that the various colorways for the Switch 2 versions will feature two different colors; in the case of these newly announced Joy-Cons, those colors are a bright, pastel purple and a vibrant aqua that the company refers to as ""Light Green."" Despite not fully agreeing with Nintendo on what constitutes light green, I actually really like these new colors. It took a long time for me to care for any of the original Switch's Joy-Con colorways enough to purchase them, as the vast majority are extremely saturated and don't feature color combinations that I feel pair well together. I was so starved for options, in fact, that I purchased the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch largely because I thought it featured the best Joy-Con colors available. In that sense, these new Joy-Cons definitely feel like an improvement. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"New GTA 6 Delay Rumor Shot Down By Reporter, Says Statement Was Misconstrued","Grand Theft Auto 6 is still a little over 10 months away, assuming its November 2026 release window holds. Earlier this week, GTA 6 watchers were unsettled when Bloomberg's Jason Schreier noted that the game might not be as ""content complete"" as Rockstar has said in the past, and he didn't rule out another delay. Some fans took that as if GTA 6 was already pushed back again, which is why Schreier has stepped forward to clarify his comments. During a recent appearance on the Button Mash podcast, Schreier said, ""The last I heard, [GTA 6] was still not content complete. That is to say people were still finishing things up, still finalizing levels, and missions, and seeing what is going to make it into the game."" He added that he doesn't ""think anyone at Rockstar can tell you, with 100% certainty, that they will make it out in November."" Schreier responded to reports based on his comments by reiterating that he ""wouldn't be shocked if GTA 6 'does' come out this fall, following the same delay pattern as [Red Dead Redemption 2]."" He also characterized some of the reports as, ""a complete misunderstanding of what I said."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"Markiplier's Iron Lung movie might be getting all the attention, but the horror game it's based on is a masterclass in the power of suggestion","Perhaps you recently glanced at the internet and saw the fuss about Iron Lung. The indie horror movie got off to a rip-roaring start last week , elbowing Melania aside to take the number two spot in the US box office charts, thwarted only by Send Help, the latest from horror movie king Sam Raimi. Iron Lung's success can almost certainly be attributed to its links with mega-popular YouTuber Mark Edward Fischbach - better known as Markiplier - for whom the project's clearly been a labour of love, given he not only self-funded it, but wrote it, directed it, and starred in it too.

Still, aim perfect, hands steady, they can't possibly miss, you think. Then they do, they always do. 100 percent guaranteed. F**k you, XCOM! I love you. Read more"
"Difficulty done differently: Cairn and Baby Steps deliver kinder, more generous masocore","For the past week, instead of actually relaxing in the evenings, I have been ascending the gnarled brute of a mountain in Cairn . The onerous journey has left the toes of its alpinist star Aava bloodied; I've pushed the tendons of her rangy fingers to snapping point. With more frequency than I care to admit, I've caused this hell-bent climber to tumble down the same part of rock face over and over again, saved only by a piton. At other times, lacking such safety measures, she has bounced all the way down to Kami's base off jagged, life-ending shards of rock. I curse the game, mountain, and myself with each major and minor tumble, every lost metre and handful of minutes. Read more"

"Don't sleep on Nioh 3's wonderful asynchronous multiplayer, a life-saver and unexpected death bringer in equal measure","Nioh's weird multiplayer has always been one of the most unique quirks of the Soulslike-cum-masocore series. I'm not talking about the needlessly complicated suite of co-op options that pals can use to run through the game together, I'm talking more about the asynchronous multiplayer that's woven into the DNA of the series itself. If you wander out into the 'open field' of Nioh 3 , for example, you will find red graves littered around the area. Each of these marks a place where a fellow player has died - and inspecting it will tell you the bloody fate they suffered. Read more"

Mewgenics is an infernal machine that runs on cats,"One of the greatest things on earth is when you're talking to someone you sort of know and they quietly switch from talking about human friends or family members to talking about their cats. It's great because there's often no meaningful alteration in tone to tell you something has changed. Cats are frequently introduced into conversation the same way a person might start talking about an intermittently beloved uncle who's just out of prison. Cats are often delightful reprobates and oddballs. They're needlessly, inventively cruel, or inhumanly calm and forbearing, or they're ostentatiously silly. One will sit on the landing and swipe at everyone. Another will hide under a bath mat, certain that they have attained complete invisibility. They are known by their names but also by their behaviours. Read more"

"""What would I change if we could go back?"" Inside Blizzard's big plan to put Overwatch back on top","Overwatch 2 had a problem. It's a problem a lot of live service games have, to be fair. It wasn't particularly exciting any more. It had a chance at launch a few years ago to excite people, to create a wave of momentum to surf thereafter, but it floundered, beset as it was with identity problems and a misguided obsession with PvE, which sounded lovely on paper but never really worked in practice. Plenty of good work was done since on the game but most people outside of Overwatch 2 don't care - or don't know, because they're not looking anymore. They've moved on, they're playing other things. Incremental updates weren't enough to turn their heads. As far as many people were concerned, Overwatch 2 was yesterday's news, been and gone. How, then, does Blizzard make people care again?

Marathon Leaks Tease A Whole Lot Of Guns,"Bungie's next live-service game, Marathon , is just a few weeks away. Preview events are already lined up around the world, including one in China, which reportedly showed off a ton of weapons and guns that will be available at launch. According to MarathonGameHQ (via Eurogamer ), there will be 28 guns in Marathon, each with two or more skins. Some of the skins will alter the weapon model.

"Best Terraria Accessories For Melee, Ranged, Magic, And Summoner","If weapons are the stars of Terraria , accessories are the quiet directors backstage. A single slot might not seem like much on its own, but with up to seven of the right trinkets equipped, your humble pixelated self transforms from target practice to terror incarnate. There’s no shortage of options, especially once you start combining effects or tinkering with modifiers. So, rather than flood you with 37 “great picks” and a dozen situational caveats, we’re cutting through the fat and crowning the best-in-class endgame accessories for each of Terraria’s four core playstyles: Melee, Ranged, Magic, and Summoner. Simple as that. And yes, you should absolutely still stack damage, crit, and movement speed modifiers like your life depends on it, because it does. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Magic: The Gathering Revenue Increased By An Astonishing Amount Last Year,"Hasbro has released its financial results for 2025, revealing a standout performance from Magic: The Gathering that saw the TCG franchise earn over $1.7 billion--an increase of 59% from the previous year and MTG's strongest year ever. Wizards of the Coast, the Hasbro subsidiary that oversees MTG, Dungeons & Dragons, and Hasbro's digital gaming projects, grew a record 45% in 2025, and was largely responsible for Hasbro's overall revenue increase of 14%. The company's other two segments, Consumer Products and Entertainment, both decreased by 4%. While Hasbro is aiming to evolve its product-heavy catalogue into a digital-first business over the coming years, tabletop gaming is still a major driver of revenue, bringing in $1.7 billion and making up over 75% of Wizard's total 2025 revenue. Across both tabletop and digital sales, Magic: The Gathering was a standout franchise in Hasbro's stable, earning $1.7 billion and making up over 60% of Hasbro's total gaming-related revenue.

Dev Gets 3D Visuals Working On Game Boy Color,"The Game Boy Color was an 8-Bit system that debuted in 1998 nearly a decade after the original Game Boy. Given the technical limitations of that era, few would have believed it was possible to create 3D images with a Game Boy Color. And yet nearly three decades after its release, a fan modder has successfully done so. Danny Spencer created real-time 3D images on the Game Boy Color and shared a blog post (via PC Guide ) where he explained at length how it was done. The short version is that Spencer had to come up with a workaround for the Game Boy Color's inability to calculate 3D graphics. His solution was to include the completed calculations and convert the resulting vectors into spherical coordinates. For the purposes of this demo, Spencer only created a 3D model of a teapot and a Game Boy Color. It's not a full-fledged game, but it works and it allows players to manipulate a 3D image from all angles in real time. In addition to the video above, a browser-based playable demo is available on Spencer's blog that utilizes a Game Boy Color emulator. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Major Diablo 2 DLC Adds Features Fans Have Waited Decades For--But It'll Cost You,"Diablo 2 fans are finally receiving new content for Diablo franchise's 30th anniversary, as Blizzard has revealed a new DLC for Diablo 2: Resurrected that will add a new class alongside some of the community's most-requested features, albeit for a price. Starting today, players will be able to purchase the Reign of the Warlock DLC for $25. While the new Warlock class , which uses summoned demons both to fight and to sacrifice in order to gain buffs, is the most notable inclusion, the community is likely to be just as excited about some of the other additions coming as part of the Reign of the Warlock: a loot filter and enhanced stash tabs. Both have been among the top features requested by the community for decades. Players have long resorted to using third-party mods or external tools for loot filters, but that will no longer be required going forward. Blizzard notes that players will not only be able to set up their own loot filters, but they will also be able to share or select custom loot filters made by others in the community.

"If You Thought Diablo 4 Didn't Have Enough Skill Trees, You're In Luck","Diablo 4's endgame is getting another radical overhaul, this time in the form of its new War Plans progression system that will add skill trees for each endgame activity, letting players customize and power-up each one. War Plans are coming as part of Diablo 4's upcoming Lord of Hatred expansion and will let players make a ""playlist"" of five activities drawn from existing endgame modes like Infernal Hordes, the Pit, Helltides, Nightmare dungeons, the Kurast Undercity, Lair bosses, and the Tree of Whispers. The more a player runs a specific type of activity, the more they will progress new activity-specific skill trees that allow players to customize them in a variety of ways. That could mean tweaking how many monsters spawn during that activity or changing the specific types of rewards it grants. Blizzard notes that players will even be able to bring aspects of some endgame activities into other ones, so players can have the best of both worlds. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Warlock Is Diablo's Newest Class, And It's Coming To (Almost) Every Diablo Game","Diablo's newest class is the Warlock, and it won't be confined to a single game in Blizzard's ARPG franchise. Instead, different flavors of the Warlock will come to all three current Diablo games: Diablo 2: Resurrected , Diablo Immortal , and Diablo 4 . Announced during Blizzard's Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight, the demonic spellcaster will first arrive in Diablo 2: Resurrected today as part of the game's Reign of the Warlock DLC, one that also introduces new endgame challenges and long-requested quality-of-life features. In Diablo 2, the Warlock will be able to summon three different demons--the Goatman, the Tainted, and the Defiler--as well as bind demons to their will. The Warlock can then sacrifice the demon to absorb their lifeforce and gain temporary buffs based on the demon consumed. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Diablo 4's Next Location Won't Be ""Grotesque, Destroyed, And Ruined,"" And Its Devs Appreciate The Break","Diablo's world of Sanctuary isn't what you'd call a hot tourist destination. Between mobs of monsters, cultists with dark designs, and a general sense of decay that permeates the landscape, Sanctuary has been forever scarred by the war between Heaven and Hell. But in Diablo 4 's second major expansion, Lord of Hatred , players will get to venture to the sacred isles of Skovos. The ancient birthplace of the firstborn civilization, Skovos is a region where humanity has thrived and has built wonders, a stark departure from the ""grotesque and destroyed"" landscape that Diablo players are used to. ""It's been fun to build a place that's not just grotesque and destroyed and ruined,"" associate game director Zaven Haroutunian said to GameSpot, explaining how the Amazons and Oracles had created a haven. ""Why is this place so safe? Why has it been able to keep all evil at bay? Because of the Amazons. They're just so f**king badass. What kind of people show up? Pirates? Whatever. Call the Amazons, they'll kill these pirates, and we'll be fine. And so it's a society that's been able to maintain its order, partly due to all its various orders, right? Amazon orders being one of them, the Oracles is another."" ""When you go to Skovos, the example I've used is, people pay their taxes, the roads get fixed, the houses aren't constantly on fire. This is a society that's taken care of, right? It is protected and is well-defended. And anytime anything goes wrong, all the Amazons show up, lock shields, and just like, f**k with anything that shows up. We wanted to pay tribute to that class and the fantasy people had when they saw it in the story. So when you go to the Skovos, you're going to see this made manifest, right? Man, when the Amazons show up, they clean up--they leave nothing, and that's how badass they are."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Diablo 4: Lord Of Hatred Puts Badass Amazons Front And Center,"Diablo 4's next expansion, Lord of Hatred, is more than just another chapter in the Diablo universe. Since its release in back in 2023, Diablo 4 has told a singular story referred to as The Hatred Saga; as its events have unfolded, we've found our character, The Wanderer, at the center of a battle between Heaven, Hell, Sanctuary, and one extremely messy family. However, all of that is about to come to a close, as Lord of Hatred sees us reunite with the game's former antagonist, Lilith, in an epic showdown against Mephisto that will both explore Sanctuary's past and settle its future. Ahead of Lord of Hatred's April 28 release date, developer Blizzard showcased the expansion--and its upcoming Warlock class--in a Spotlight presentation. Prior to the showcase, GameSpot had the opportunity to sit down with Diablo 4's associate game director Zaven Haroutunian and art director Nick Chilano to dig deeper into why players should be excited for the arc's epic finale. The pair spoke in depth about Skovos , its Amazonian guardians, what this moment means for Diablo as a whole, and how happy they are that fans love ""mommy"" Lilith . GameSpot: First things first, I would like to talk to you both a bit more about Skovos. Skovos, I feel, has been this mythological place in Diablo. It was teased back in Diablo II, we thought maybe it was going to be explored and then it wasn't, and now we're finally getting it. What is it like to realize something that has been so monumental to the community? Continue Reading at GameSpot"
How A Diablo 2 Game Manual Found New Purpose In Diablo 4's Latest Expansion,"Diablo 4 's Lord of Hatred expansion goes live in April, and one of its big draws is that players will finally get a chance to explore a location that has only been hinted at for decades. The Skovos Isles were teased in ancient texts--better known as the Diablo 2 game manual--and it's that very same pocket-sized manuscript that inspired Blizzard to create a region that has been left relatively unscathed by the doom and gloom that has befallen Sanctuary over the centuries. ""I've been playing Diablo games since the very beginning, so I had that exact same feeling of like, 'Oh my God, it's Skovos. I get to go there. I'm going to meet the Amazons.' I want to do all this stuff--meet the Oracles and so on,"" associate game director Zaven Haroutunian said to GameSpot. ""It's someplace we've never really gone in this series. No game has gone deeper than a scratch into what this place is. So it was a good opportunity to kind of sit back and take stock of the series' entire history."" ""When we were building Skovos--not just the story part, but the culture there and the characters and the history--we were going through the Diablo 2 manual trying to rediscover what we've said about this place,"" Haroutunian continued. ""We wrote everything down like, 'Oh, we didn't name all the islands. Let's name islands. Let's try to draw these things from the book.' Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Fallout Season 2's Cameo Performer May Have Bigger Role In Season 3,"Following the events of Fallout Season 2, most of the wasteland's major factions stand revealed.

Microsoft Is Considering A Big Game Pass Change - Report,"A report claims that Microsoft could merge Xbox Game Pass Premium and PC Game Pass together. Tom Warren of The Verge reported that Microsoft was considering such a move. Xbox Game Pass Premium is the $15/month version of Game Pass that comes with access to a library of 200+ games, but not day-one new releases. PC Game Pass, meanwhile, costs $16.50/month and includes access to ""hundreds"" of PC games, as well as new games on day one. The Verge's report didn't have any word on what the price of a hypothetically merged subscription would be, or any other features. The site also reported that other upcoming changes to Game Pass in the future could be more third-party services bundled in. Some of these today include EA Play, Fortnite Crew, and Ubisoft+ Classics for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The report also claimed that the rumored free Xbox Cloud Gaming offering (in exchange for ads) will not be its own separate Game Pass tier. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Even Analysts Are Having A Hard Time Predicting How Much The Steam Machine Will Cost,"We still don't know the price of the Steam Machine , and a recent interview with one of the video game industry's leading analysts shows just how hard it is to predict. Circana senior director and video game industry advisor Mat Piscatella showed that was the case in a recent interview with GamesRadar . Piscatella told the publication that he ""could see $1,000"" as the system's price tag, but also admitted that he ""could see them going nuts and going under $700 if they want to eat some of those costs."" The price of the Steam Machine is tough to predict because of factors outside of the video game industry itself. The United States' tariffs and the rising costs of components like RAM make the production of video game hardware more expensive than it has ever been in recent memory. ""If you want to bring out a new Steam Machine this year, trying to come out with an announced price point, given what's going on in all these other areas of the market, is challenging,"" Piscatella explained.

StarCraft Shooter Reportedly In Works At Arc Raiders Publisher,"Nexon, parent company of Embark and its successful extraction shooter Arc Raiders , is reportedly working on a shooter set in the StarCraft universe in collaboration with Blizzard. A recent article by The Korea Economic Daily , reported by IGN , suggests that Nexon has the project underway in one of its shooter divisions, with a former StarCraft modder at the helm. This is the second time that Nexon has been reported to be working with the franchise, with South Korean financial news outlet MTN reporting in early 2025 that the publisher had secured the license from Blizzard after pitching its ideas to the StarCraft creators. The Korea Economic Daily caveats its reporting with the fact that Nexon has previously attempted to license properties in a similar way from Square Enix, but has yet to launch a product. This isn't the first time a StarCraft shooter has been rumored, however, with reporting from earlier this year suggesting that Blizzard is planning to reveal the project at BlizzCon 2026 . The existence of a StarCraft shooter has predated that report, too, with the project being mentioned in Jason Schreier's book Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment in 2024.

"Blizzard Boss Teases ""Exciting Conversations"" About Hollywood Adaptations","Ten years ago, one of Blizzard's most-popular franchises hit the big screen in Warcraft, but there haven't been any further adaptations of the company's IP. In the decade since Warcraft hit theaters, video game adaptations have heated up again. According to Blizzard president Johanna Faries, studios are still knocking on the company's door. But it may take more than they can offer to get them off the ground. During a recent profile by Windows Central , Faries indicated that ""exciting conversations"" have taken place about new adaptations. She also noted that Blizzard is focused on the quality of any TV shows or movies based on its games. ""We just want to be responsible with the IP, right?,"" said Faries. ""We want to make sure that if we bring anything forward, whether it's gameplay or whether it's beyond that, that it represents what we want it to signify. On behalf of Blizzard, it's got to be best in class ... we have set the bar in many ways, in terms of creative excellence, and so that's really what we're going to focus in on.""

Mewgenics Just Beat The Binding of Isaac's Concurrent Player Record,"Mewgenics has already bested Binding of Isaac: Rebirth's concurrent-player record, just over 24 hours since release. This means, at least by one metric, it is co-developer Edmund McMillan's most successful release yet. As of 1:30 ET on Wednesday February 11, Mewgenics has an all-time best concurrent-player count of 74,176, which is 4,000 players above Binding of Isaac: Rebirth's record of 70,701. Mewgenics is also leagues above most of McMillan's other releases, in term of concurrent player count. The original Binding of Isaac has a peak of 12,575 players, while Super Meat Boy has a high of 5,153. Mewgenics already made back its budget just 180 minutes after release. Mewgenics is a collaboration between Super Meat Boy and Binding of Isaac dev Edmund McMillan and Bombernaut developer Tyler Glaiel. It is a roguelike-tactics game where you command a platoon of cats through three torturous acts. Any kittens who survive the onslaught become the parents to a new generation of feline warriors. The game won big praise from reviewer Jason Rodriguez, who said in GameSpot's 9/10 Mewgenics review , ""Although it can easily overwhelm you with a high degree of complexity early on, this gradually gives way to an appreciation for the many strategic layers cleverly constructed amongst the chaos.""

StarCraft’s Factions Are Getting Pocket-Sized Reinforcements,"It's been a busy month for Blizzard as it reveals what's next for game franchises like Overwatch, Warcraft, and Diablo, and for StarCraft fans, the big news is that it's coming to toy shelves soon. Toy manufacturer JoyToy has officially announced that it will produce collectibles based on the sci-fi real-time strategy series, and it has teased several Terran, Zerg, and Protoss figures to kick off this line. Like several of its other toys, these are ""small-scale"" action figures measuring approximately 10cm, and the studio says it's aiming to recreate several small details. Metallic power armor for Terrans, biological Zerg details, and advanced energy armaments of the Protoss are some of the features being teased by the company. JoyToy has become a popular brand over the last couple of years, as its Warhammer 40,000 action figures have been very well received since entering production. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"GTA 6 Could Help Make 2026 Gaming's Biggest Year Ever, Analysts Say","GTA 6 and ongoing Switch 2 sales could make 2026 a massive year for the video game industry. Marketing data firm Circana has predicted that GTA 6 will help fuel a record-breaking year, projecting a total income of $62.8 billion. That number would exceed 2021's previous record of $61.7 billion and would represent a 3% growth over 2025, which broke $60.7 billion. GTA 6 represents the highest ""purchase intent"" recorded since Circana began tracking the metric. The firm also predicts the game's sales will help drive accessory and subscription purchases. The Switch 2 is already the fastest-selling console of all-time ; Circana predicts the momentum will continue into 2026. Subscription services like PlayStation Plus and Xbox Game Pass were also major drivers of revenue in 2025 and are expected to continue to grow in the current year. Additionally, Circana's report emphasizes that 2026 has a set of challenges. Rising hardware costs, escalating prices in other economic sectors, and the increasing popularity of free-to-play PC and mobile games like Roblox and Fortnite could shake up the industry. The release of the Steam Machine could also represent a significant shift in the market. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Wait, Masters Of Albion Is Chapter One In A Planned Trilogy?","Despite saying last year that his upcoming god game Masters Of Albion would be his last game, English game designer Peter Molyneux has claimed that this game is actually just one chapter in a planned trilogy. Speaking to IGN on February 11 , Molyneux said that Masters of Albion will launch in early access as chapter one in a three-part ""epic."" It's a ""complete game"" that will feature the familiar beats of the hero's journey. ""So this is an epic,” Molyneux said. ""We are thinking about three epic chapters, I suppose you'd call them. Then what we'll be releasing into early access will be chapter one, and it's going to take us quite a few years to get to chapter three. But this chapter one, it has a story. It starts as a classic story of a hero coming and finding his power. There was an adversary who was doing something awful. There was a confrontation. It's a classic. This first chapter is a classic beat of that narrative story. There's going to be love, loss, hate, and betrayal in that first episode of the story. So it is a complete game. We are just thinking bigger rather than, 'Right, this is the game. That's it.' We've always been thinking about this bigger story."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"This New Starship Troopers Boomer Shooter Is Out Next Month, Do You Want To Know More?","The 1997 film Starship Troopers is a nuanced satire of fascism and ultraviolence. No one really cares about that, though, because the franchise is at its best when the focus is on squashing bugs. Developer Auroch Digital (Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun) is looking to do its part with Starship Troopers: Ultimate Bug War, a first-person boomer-shooter that looks like it was pulled straight out of the late '90s. It's launching on March 16 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2, and a PC demo is now available . Do you want to know more? Similar to its work on Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun, Auroch Digital has gone with an action-first approach and low-polygon graphics for this Starship Troopers game. Players will get to lead troops through battlefields infested with bugs, wield an arsenal of over 30 weapons--including the classic Morita autorifle, mechs, and tactical nukes--and take part in a campaign that's peppered with FMVs featuring General Johnny Rico, who is once again played by actor Casper Van Dien. Starship Troopers has maintained a video game presence over the years, with recent entries including the real-time strategy game Starship Troopers: Terran Command in 2022 and the 2024 FPS Starship Troopers: Extermination . Arrowhead's Helldivers 2 is considered to be the best Starship Troopers game currently, even if it has nothing to do with the franchise other than its on-the-nose references to the movie.

Resident Evil 4 PC Performance Drastically Worsened By New DRM Update - Report,"Following growing speculation that Resident Evil 4's latest patch has negatively affected its performance on PC, Digital Foundry has confirmed this through its own testing. The outlet tested both the current and previous version of the game (by way of a mod), with the core difference between the two being the type of DRM implemented. Previously, Resident Evil 4 made use of Denuvo DRM, while its latest update has replaced it with Enigma Protector DRM. This new version of DRM has introduced major bottlenecks when it comes to CPU performance, with Digital Foundry measuring nearly 2ms lost to CPU processing times in some instances. With its testing setup that prioritized CPU-limited scenarios, this manifested a massive decrease in output frame rate, down to 144fps from 217fps. It should be noted that these slowdowns won't be as noticeable, if at all, in GPU-limited scenarios, or in instances where the game's AI is providing a larger overhead than the new DRM features. Still, it's an example of an update measurably changing the performance of a product years after release without any real benefit to its players. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Fable Reveal Made Peter Molyneux Emotional, Feels Game's World Has ""Antiseptic"" Feel To It","Peter Molyneux, who created the Fable series and is known for hyperbole , has reacted to the recent Fable reveal , saying it made him ""incredibly emotional"" and that is he proud to know his creation is living on. He also said the game's world, in its current state, has a ""slight antiseptic"" feel that lacks character and grime. Speaking to IGN , Molyneux said he is a person who cries frequently, and he felt himself ""tearing up"" when he saw the new trailer in January. ""I felt incredibly emotional, and the reason I felt emotional was: 'F*** me. This thing that we created, it's going to live, it's going to carry on. This world, which we loved creating so much, and other people loved, has a life,'"" he said. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

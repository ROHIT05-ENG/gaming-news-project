Is a Baldur's Gate 3 TV show a good idea and does it matter that Larian isn't involved?,"Another day, another game getting the TV treatment, but this one's a biggie: Dungeons & Dragons owner Wizards of the Coast this week revealed Craig Mazin, showrunner on HBO's divisive The Last of Us television adaptation, is turning his hand to Baldur's Gate , and specifically continuing the story of Baldur's Gate 3 on TV. Developer Larian's fantasy RPG is, of course, a hugely beloved game, and responses to the news have been swift, strong, and not entirely positive. Feelings have also been floating around the Eurogamer office (well, it's more of a chat room, but you get the point), and, thus, the embers of this week's The Big Question were inflamed.

"Markiplier's Iron Lung movie might be getting all the attention, but the horror game it's based on is a masterclass in the power of suggestion","Perhaps you recently glanced at the internet and saw the fuss about Iron Lung. The indie horror movie got off to a rip-roaring start last week , elbowing Melania aside to take the number two spot in the US box office charts, thwarted only by Send Help, the latest from horror movie king Sam Raimi. Iron Lung's success can almost certainly be attributed to its links with mega-popular YouTuber Mark Edward Fischbach - better known as Markiplier - for whom the project's clearly been a labour of love, given he not only self-funded it, but wrote it, directed it, and starred in it too. But whatever there is to be said about the movie (critical opinion is mixed ), its headline-making turn has finally given me the nudge to check out the game it's based on, having languished on my Steam wishlist for so long. And, yup, it's a good 'un. Read more"

With more frequency than I care to admit, I've caused this hell-bent climber to tumble down the same part of rock face over and over again, saved only by a piton. At other times, lacking such safety measures, she has bounced all the way down to Kami's base off jagged, life-ending shards of rock. I curse the game, mountain, and myself with each major and minor tumble, every lost metre and handful of minutes. Read more"

Mewgenics is an infernal machine that runs on cats,"One of the greatest things on earth is when you're talking to someone you sort of know and they quietly switch from talking about human friends or family members to talking about their cats. It's great because there's often no meaningful alteration in tone to tell you something has changed. Cats are frequently introduced into conversation the same way a person might start talking about an intermittently beloved uncle who's just out of prison. Cats are often delightful reprobates and oddballs. They're needlessly, inventively cruel, or inhumanly calm and forbearing, or they're ostentatiously silly. One will sit on the landing and swipe at everyone. Another will hide under a bath mat, certain that they have attained complete invisibility. They are known by their names but also by their behaviours. Read more"

Pokemon Go Dev Removes Pokestop From Epstein's Island,"Until recently, Little Saint James--the private island formerly owned by convicted sex criminal and alleged human trafficker Jeffrey Epstein--had a Pokemon Go Pokestop. But following an outcry among players, the Epstein Island Pokestop has been removed by Pokemon Go owner Scopely. According to Polygon , it's unclear when the Pokestop was added to the island, although Ingress estimates that it was somewhere between 2020 and 2021. Epstein died in prison in 2019, and the island isn't easily accessible to the general public. That hasn't stopped players from fooling the game and letting Pokemon Go virtually place them on the island. Per Kotaku , the number of virtual Pokemon Go visits to Little Saint James dramatically increased this month as a way to draw attention to the Pokestop that was originally noticed well over a year ago. The release of a new round of Epstein files appears to have spurred that surge, until Scopely quietly removed the Pokestop earlier this week. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Highguard Dev Reflects On The Layoffs After Surviving The Cuts,"Highguard hasn't even been out a month yet, but the raid shooter has had an epic fall since that time.

Now, one of the remaining developers at Wildlight has shared his thoughts on what happened. Jason McCord--the creative director of Highguard--confirmed on social media that he is still a part of the company. But he added that ""yesterday was a kick to the head like nothing you can imagine. I am not affected by the layoffs, besides emotional damage."" McCord went on to offer contacts ""for some amazing devs"" if any other teams want to hire Wildlight's former employees.

"New Legacy Of Kain Game Revealed, And It’s Out Next Month","It might have taken 22 years, but at long last, a brand-new Legacy of Kain game has been announced. Developed by BitBot Media, Legacy of Kain: Ascendance is a pixel-art platformer with plenty of action at its core, and it'll launch for PC and console on March 31. Set before and during the events of Soul Reaver, Ascendance explores an era of the Legacy of Kain games that has only been briefly referenced--and before time-travel shenanigans started to make things a little confusing. Kain is in the middle of his campaign to conquer Nosgoth, while Raziel appears as a human Seraphan who fights back against the vampire clans. A third character--Elaleth from the recent Legacy of Kain: Dead Shall Rise comic book mini-series--is also playable, and she's described as a fast-paced brawler who is adept at both combat and platforming. Crystal Dynamics and BitBot estimate that it will take roughly four hours to complete this retro-inspired platformer. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
New Castlevania Game Is Coming From The Dead Cells And Rogue Prince Of Persia Devs,"Announced with a reveal trailer during the February 2026 State of Play , Castlevania: Belmont's Curse is a new 2D action platformer coming from Konami alongside Motion Twin and Evil Empire--those last two being the studios behind Dead Cells and The Rogue Prince of Persia , respectively. The reveal trailer for Belmont's Curse says the game is coming this year in 2026, but no specifics beyond that. Oddly enough, while both Dead Cells and The Rogue Prince of Persia are roguelite games (good ones, too!), it doesn't seem like Belmont's Curse is. Neither the reveal trailer nor the PlayStation Blog written by Konami promotion planner Moeko Nagaoka states the game is a roguelite. The game could still be one, but it's looking like it might just be an action platformer. According to Nagaoka, Belmont's Curse is set in Paris in 1499. The game sees you play as the successor to Trevor Belmont (who you can see in the trailer!), who brings both the family whip and a sword into battle. Nagaoka also notes that there ""will be more weapons and abilities for you to master."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"Sony Reveals New God Of War Sidescroller, And It's Out Right Now","During Sony's State of Play presentation , God of War: Sons of Sparta was officially announced. The new title is the first 2D action platformer in the long-running God of War franchise. The story explores Kratos' early years during his brutal training in the Agoge. Players will follow a young Kratos as he trains alongside his brother Deimos, learning the harsh lessons that shape his future--and it's available to play now. The game's story comes from the team at Santa Monica Studio, known for God of War (2018) and God of War Ragnarok. Original Kratos voice actor TC Carson returns to voice the adult Kratos for the first time in over a decade, serving as the game's narrator. Check out the trailer below. Developed by Mega Cat Studios, the trailer looks like the game will bring the series' fast and powerful combat into a new 2D style. Kratos fights using his spear and shield and can wield divine relics called the Gifts of Olympus. The game also features hand-drawn pixel animation, classic enemies reimagined in 2D, and new creatures inspired by Greek mythology. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Silent Hill: Townfall Shifts First-Person Survival Horror To New Town,"Silent Hill producer Motoi Okamoto recently teased more games set outside of the infamous small town. As confirmed during Sony's State of Play , the next game in the franchise is following Silent Hill f's example by leaving Silent Hill behind. However, Silent Hill: Townfall is adding its own spin and sending the franchise into first-person survival horror. Silent Hill: Townfall was previously announced in 2022 and is being developed by a studio called Screen Burn. The new protagonist's name is Simon Ordell, and he's found himself in the seaside town of St. Amelia. Although the place seems to be eerily deserted, Simon won't be by himself for long. As with other Silent Hill games, Simon's personal demons are given physical form here, and he'll have to defeat them to survive. The biggest shift for this title is the first-person gameplay, as well as the handheld portable TV that Simon uses to detect the monsters in St. Amelia. It's an updated version of the radio that previous Silent Hill games have used for the same function. It's not quite as functional as Solid Snake's Codec Radar in the Metal Gear Solid games, but the TV can be used to help Simon hide from the monsters instead of facing them head on.

"God Of War Trilogy Remake Announced, Brings Back Original Voice Actor","A remake of the original God of War trilogy is in the works, but it's still early days.

"Beast Of Reincarnation Creator Says ""Every Single Thing"" About Making It ""Has Been A Challenge""","Since its reveal at last summer's Xbox Games Showcase , Game Freak's newest venture, Beast of Reincarnation, has sparked both excitement and curiosity in equal measure. For the past few decades, Game Freak has firmly established its identity as the studio behind the Pokemon series; as such, the realistic-looking action-RPG marks a notable shift from the cartoonish creature-collection series. In Beast of Reincarnation, players take on the role of Emma, a Purifier tasked with putting a stop to an ever-encroaching and life-threatening blight. Though this is no small task, she's not alone; alongside Emma is her wolf-life companion, Koo, who aids her on her journey through an overgrown, post-apocalyptic Japan. In the game's latest trailer, we saw a bit more about what exploration and combat will look like, and while you'll still be issuing commands to a furry friend, the action-packed RPG is a far cry from what we've come to expect from Game Freak. So, why the dramatic departure from the studio's tried-and-true visual stylings and formula? That's just one of the questions GameSpot got the chance to ask Beast of Reincarnation's director, Kota Furushima. Ahead of the game's August 4 release date, we spoke with Furushima about the challenges he's experienced during production, what the game's core message is, and why--despite the company's long-standing relationship with Nintendo--Beast of Reincarnation is still not confirmed for Switch.

Legacy Of Kain Is Back With Two New Games,"Kain is deified. The fans tell tales of him, few know the truth… …because the last mainline entry in the series was released a depressing 22 years ago and, since then, the franchise has faded into obscurity. Although it reappeared as an ill-conceived multiplayer game called Nosgoth , it was quickly shoved back into Crystal Dynamics' IP catacombs. Fans, meanwhile, were left to sustain themselves on raw burning passion for the world of Nosgoth and little else. Legacy of Kain has one of the most talented self-sustaining communities I've ever encountered and, as a long-suffering fan, I have been the beneficiary of their passion. If you know where to look, you can find them creating fan art , preserving and restoring cut content , writing fanfic , building out encyclopedias , making texture updates , and producing lore videos . And you can tell just how long they've been at it because most of the websites housing that, to my delight, look like they're trapped in the '90s. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"John Wick Is Getting A 3D Action Game, Lets You Murder Gangsters With Household Objects","Keanu Reeves will take video game form once again in an as-yet-untitled John Wick 3D action game, based on the film franchise. The game's debut trailer during the February 2026 State of Play was mostly a slick, pre-rendered cinematic, but featured some gameplay footage at the end. Saber Interactive is developing the game, in collaboration with Lionsgate, Keanu Reeves (who appears to be lending both his likeness and his voice), and John Wick director Chad Stahelski. The trailer cuts between the titular assassin trying on a new suit at a tailor, interspersed with Wick besting foes across a variety of locations. In one sequence, he is fighting goons in the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant and beats one man's head in with a frying pan. In another, he swaps gunfire with henchman in a lavish manor. The trailer concludes with a flurry of quick shots of Wick murdering henchman, including, yes, Wick grabbing a pencil from a desk and stabbing a gangster he has got in an arm hold. It's clear that this John Wick adaptation is a real-time action game, but the trailers provides no hints as to exactly how it will play or how it will be structured. The game will also feature driving, though the trailer featured no footage of that gameplay element. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Here's A First Look At Resident Evil Requiem's Raccoon City Police Department Decades After RE2,"Ahead of Resident Evil Requiem 's February 27 release date, developer Capcom has shared a new trailer showcasing a healthy amount of Leon as a part of Sony's February State of Play . While we already knew the upcoming survival horror game is sending Leon Kennedy back to where it all began--the Raccoon City Police Department--the latest trailer gave us a closer look at what his former place of employment looks like today. Spoiler: It's not great! While there's no more Mr. X lurking around the building, the RPD has certainly seen better days. Though there's still no telling how much of the department we'll get to tour this time around--or even how much of it is still left standing--we can't deny that we're positively giddy at the prospect of leading a ""hot uncle"" Leon through its ruins.

The first, Dead or Alive 6 Last Round, is an update of 2019's Dead or Alive 6 for the PS5, with promises of new content and updates coming. Both full-price and free-to-play versions of the game will be available. Four characters will be available in the free version of Dead or Alive 6 Last Round at launch, and going from previous series releases, the free-to-play version will likely contain a rotating roster of playable characters over time.

The full-price package includes five previously DLC-only fighters, bringing the number of playable characters up to 29, and a selection of costumes for the whole cast. Following the trailer, however, Hayashi also teased that a new Dead or Alive project is in the works. This comes during something of a renaissance for 3D fighting games, with a new Virtua Fighter title also in development.

Legacy Of Kain: Defiance Rises Again With New Remaster,"The Legacy of Kain series is rising from its slumber once again, as today's State of Play revealed not one but two projects that will see players return to Nosgoth. Fans of the classic games can look forward to a remaster of Legacy of Kain: Defiance when it launches on March 3 for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch. Released back in 2003, Defiance was the third chapter in the Soul Reaver saga. The big twist here was that Raziel and Kain were both playable characters, allowing players to step into the boots of the vampire lord and his former lieutenant. Crystal Dynamics has been working on the Defiance remaster for several years alongside PlayEveryWare, a team with credits on several video game ports. Similar to Soul Reaver 1&2 Remastered , you can expect upgraded visuals and cinematics, remastered audio, and several gameplay changes. The combat tutorial is now an independent feature, a new photo mode has been added, and the game's fixed camera has been replaced with a new free-floating camera system. Players can also switch to the original camera angles for an old-school experience, and the canonical map of Nosgoth introduced in the previous Soul Reaver remasters is back. It has also been enhanced with a new feature, Foresight Navigation, which essentially lets players better track their objectives on the map. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Ghost Of Yotei Becomes Legendary With New Multiplayer DLC Coming In March,"After being teased at last year's Gamescom , fans have their first look at Ghost of Yotei Legends, and it'll be available in March. Legends is a free online co-op mode included with patch 1.5 for all Ghost of Yotei owners. In this mode, players team up with friends to battle powerful, supernatural versions of the Yotei Six. Players can choose from four classes: Samurai, Archer, Mercenary, or Shinobi. Every class can use a katana and ranged weapons, but each one specializes in different combat styles. The Samurai wields the odachi and uses the widest range of weapons. The Archer can fight with a spear (yari) and carry an extra ranged weapon. The Mercenary uses dual katanas and utility-focused skills. The Shinobi fights with a kusarigama and focuses on stealth abilities. Each class can unlock unique armor cosmetics by completing in-game challenges. As players level up, they can earn powerful legendary weapons and gear by taking on harder difficulties. Photo Mode returns, allowing teams to capture action moments together. Between missions, the new Legends lobby offers ways to relax, including combat and archery practice, friendly games of Zeni Hajiki, and Bamboo Strike high-score challenges.

4 Loop Has A Giant Rubik's Cube Boss And Alien Berries That Teleport Enemies,"4 Loop, the co-op shooter from Left 4 Dead designer Mike Booth and JJ Abrams' studio Bad Robot Games, has a roguelike structure, along with lots of wacky, interlocking systems like alien plant life and and a Rubik's Cube boss--and we got a new look at all of it. PlayStation's State of Play for February 2026 showed off more of what to expect from the recently announced game . The basic premise is this: Up to four players team up as part of a team fighting off a devastating alien invasion. The players will start each run of 4 Loop by voting for nodes on the Probability Map (think the map from Slay the Spire) which will determine the mission undertaken. Each mission is randomly generated. Players will tackle different objectives like rescuing survivors, collecting new resources, or hacking into alien computers. As long as just one player survives the mission, all four players will 3D-print back at base and be ready to take on the next challenge. Once the whole team is safe, they can select new weapons for their loadout and pick up upgrades. Each section of the probability map ends in a boss, a mission unto itself with a massive alien enemy. The gameplay trailer shown at the State of Play showed a gigantic Rubik's Cube-style robot with rotating sides. The Scanner boss scans the environment with laser grids that players will have to avoid. Players will have to fire at the boss from multiple sides to hit weak points, as the boss will turn its segmented parts. Players can also encounter tools out in the world, like berries that, when thrown, teleport items in the area to a far-away place on the map. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Assassin's Creed Is Doing Better Than Expected,"Business at Ubisoft continues to grow in some areas, as employees protest layoffs and game cancellations. A newly released Ubisoft earning report states that Q3's ""overperformance versus expectations was primarily driven by partnerships and the Assassin’s Creed franchise."" Net bookings for Q3 stood at €338 million (approximately $401 million), which is 12% higher than the same quarter in last fiscal year. Most of the quarter's income (€297m) came from Ubisoft's back catalog. In particular, Assassin's Creed as a franchise had 28% more total players than the same time last year, thanks in part to free DLC for Assassin's Creed: Mirage and the Switch 2 release of Assassin's Creed: Shadows . The report also names The Division 2 and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora as games that saw significant growth in Q3--in the case of Avatar, it likely saw an influx of players as hype picked up for the latest Avatar film. Overall, 130 million unique players booted up Ubisoft games during the quarter, which the report claims is evidence of ""the appeal and strength of the Group’s portfolio of franchises."" In January, the publisher closed Ubisoft Halifax, fired 70 employees, and canceled multiple in-development projects . Ubisoft also fired a 12-year veteran without stated cause , though the termination was shortly after he criticized the company's ""return-to-work"" mandate. The earnings report outlined further plans to ""reshape [Ubisoft's] HQ into a leaner and focused organization"" via ""a voluntary departure plan."" In response to the layoffs, 1,200 Ubisoft employees, primarily in France, have gone on a three-day strike ."

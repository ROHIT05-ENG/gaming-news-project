Battlefield 6 Update Improves Jet Combat And Knife Attacks,"Earlier this week, Battlefield 6 's Season 2 launch was pushed back to February 17 to give the development team more time to implement some needed changes.

Electronic Arts has announced that Battlefield 6 Update 1.1.3.5 will arrive on Tuesday, January 20, and it's bringing some good news for anyone who wanted the jet combat to be more refined. Going forward, jet cannon damage against flying vehicles has been greatly reduced, and it will take ""approximately 40% more hits"" to blow targets out of the sky. However, the air radar that was previously announced will not be included in this update. Melee combat was also a priority for this update, which aims to improve ""responsiveness, consistency, and sprint behavior for melee attacks, including knives and the sledgehammer."" The Assault Ladder should also be more functional after this update, and the patch notes indicate that it has resolved some issues with the user interface and heads-up display in Redsec and Multiplayer, in addition to better stability for the Battle Royale and Gauntlet modes.

Animal Crossing's 3.0 Update Just Killed Existing Hotel Businesses,"It’s a bad time to be in the Animal Crossing hotel business. New Horizons’ 3.0 update introduced a wave of new features, but one addition stands out above the rest: a fully fledged hotel that appears on the pier of every island. Overnight, that official beachfront resort has effectively put countless player-made hotels out of business. That might matter more if anyone besides Tom Nook--and the long-suffering players paying off his loans--actually exchanged money in New Horizons. Still, the arrival of an island-sanctioned hotel has made the decision to tear down pre-update resorts an easy one for many players who suddenly found their handmade creations obsolete. ""The fateful day has come for the new update, and the local resident-run hotel has fallen on hard times thanks to the illegally constructed hotel on the pier,"" wrote Redditor ll_LoneWolfe_ll in a post .

Some Of Monster Hunter Wilds' PC Issues Are Caused By Weird Glitch,"Earlier this month, some Monster Hunter Wilds players reported that the game actually performed better on Steam when it has more DLC installed. Word about that improvement spread quickly among the Monster Hunter Wilds community, but the real reason for the game's improvement isn't about whether the game has DLC. Instead, the problem arises when Monster Hunter Wilds checks for DLC. Digital Foundry debunked the notion that more DLC was speeding up Monster Hunter Wilds. Instead, DF discovered that there's an automatic check for DLC that greatly impacts Wilds' performance. According to the report, when the option for DLC content was offered, the game itself ""checked for DLC thousands upon thousands of times, adding to the CPU load of an already over-burdened processor"" in less than a minute. Essentially, this recurring issue in the hub area near a Support Desk Felynes has nothing to do with the DLC itself; it's happening because the game is constantly checking for DLC. That's slowing everything down, even if there isn't any DLC to be found. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

So you might see some that are smaller, and you might see some that are even grander than what we've got now."" Watkins didn't share specific details about what will be featured in the new maps, but he added that ""the ambition is to try to pair it with some new type of experience, whether that's the map conditions or weather conditions we put in that make the play feel different, enemy types or compositions feeling different, or we're escalating the types of loot available there.""

"Fallout Season 2 Viewership Numbers Are Way Down, But There Is An Obvious Reason Why","The newest Nielsen ratings have arrived, showing a gigantic drop-off for Fallout Season 2 compared to Fallout Season 1. However, there is an obvious explanation for the dip. According to The Hollywood Reporter , Fallout viewership reached 794 million minutes on Prime Video for the week of December 15-21, which covers when Season 2 debuted on December 16. Season 1 racked up 2.9 billion minutes of streaming time during its own opening week in April 2024. That's a 72% decrease, but the massive downturn was no doubt attributable to how the two seasons were released. Season 1, many may recall, was released in a binge format with all episodes arriving at the same time. Season 2, meanwhile, is adopting a weekly release schedule. What's more, just one episode of Fallout Season 2 was released on December 16, compared to two or three that Prime Video does for some of its other shows. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Online Auctions For Cory In The House DS Game Are Asking For Hundreds Amid Meme Campaign,"As part of a joke that is perhaps going too far, the markedly terrible Cory in the House game is not only closely trailing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 in user ratings, but sealed copies of it are priced for hundreds of dollars online. There are numerous listings for the Nintendo DS game on eBay , with prices ranging from $50 to $1,420.69 (har, har). One listing even has 44 bids and currently prices the game at $1,025.00. This bizarre event appears to stem from the Best Games by User Score list of GameSpot sister site Metacritic, which currently has 2025 Game of the Year winner Clair Obscur sitting at the top with a 9.6 user score. But because the internet loves a good gag, Cory in the House has recently surfaced as the runner-up with a score of 9.3, tied with The Witcher 3, two versions of Metal Gear Solid 3, the original Silent Hill 2, and a couple of other classics.

Helldivers 2 Is Letting Players Vote On Which Planet Gets Hit By Its Not-A-Death-Star,"Helldivers 2 prides itself on the concept of Managed Democracy, and in the latest example of crowdsourced decision-making, the game is asking players to choose a planet to blow up with a shiny new not-a-Death-Star superweapon. Fortunately, these planets aren't home to any brave Helldivers and are instead populated by the undemocratic factions that refuse to yield to Super Earth. The latest twist in the Helldivers 2 saga kicked off last week when Super Earth announced that it was upgrading the Democracy Space Station with the Star of Peace weapon. The platform can now fire a ""macro-scale laser"" optimized for ""mass Freedom dispensation"" that collapses an entire planet into a black hole. Helldivers players are now being asked to boot up the Democracy Space Station voting panel from their Galactic Map and choose one of three planets: Zagon Prime, Penta, or Valmox. These are held by the Terminids, Automatons, and Illuminate, respectively. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Hytale Guides Hub,"Hytale is the long-in-development Minecraft competitor from the team at Hypixel.

All Armor Crafting Recipes In Hytale,"There are few things more important in Hytale than the armor your character equips. Armor can save you from dying to a dangerous mob when you're exploring at night or in a dark cave. It also plays a large part in how your character looks, which does play a factor in your experience if you play in third person. While you might have already figured out how to craft the most basic armor in Hytale, there are several more advanced options that offer stronger protection from mobs. The guide below shows you all of the current crafting recipes we have for armor in Hytale. As a note, some armor that you see in a Creative-mode world might not be available in Survival yet, similar to our guide on all Hytale weapons . Table of Contents [ hide ] How to craft armor in Hytale How to craft armor in Hytale A character donning some rare armor in Hytale If you view your character from the inventory screen in Hytale, you'll see that you have four available slots to equip armor. These slots are for your Helm, Gauntlets, Cuirass, and Greaves. For some reason, there is no dedicated boot slot, but maybe that will be added in a future update. You also have a slot for a shield, but that's not necessarily armor, so we won't be covering those crafting recipes. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
How To Increase Inventory Space In Hytale - Backpack Upgrade Guide,"Your starting inventory space in Hytale is likely all you need early on.

While you might think you'll always be left with the default inventory size, that's not the case in Hytale. How to unlock the backpack in Hytale To increase the size of your inventory, you need to unlock and use the backpack in Hytale. The backpack is a separate item from the default inventory, but its sole goal is to give you more slots to put items.

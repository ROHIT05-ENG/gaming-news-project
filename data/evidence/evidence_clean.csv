Horses review,"One thing that's probably got a bit lost in all the controversy preceding Horses' release is the fact it's surprisingly funny. Its humour is pitch black, yes, and its comedic moments often dance on a knife's edge between laughter and revulsion, but writer and director Andrea Lucco Borlera's first-person narrative horror - his debut game, created in close collaboration with Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione - is a fascinatingly singular vision. It's singular enough, in fact, that it's not an easy thing to effectively describe, but if you can imagine a sort of thematic reinterpretation of Animal Farm by way of Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salo on one side, and a meme-able Garry's Mod video on the other, then Horses gleefully oscillates between them, landing somewhere in the middle.

Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's chatty space marine companions aren't so bad - it's Samus who is this game's narrative problem,"As Metroid Prime 4: Beyond hits storefronts, I'm pretty sure you're going to see a whole lot of fevered debate online about the game's curious choice to place Samus, famously quiet Bounty Hunter, as the de facto head of a squad of Galactic Federation soldiers. Does it still feel like Metroid, famed for its sense of creepy, atmospherically rich isolation, if Samus has a buddy in her ear or - worse - alongside her physically?

Metroid Prime 4: Beyond review,"Taken as a whole, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond feels like something of a composite. On one hand, it is clearly a follow-up to 2007's Metroid Prime 3: Corruption , drawing close many of that game's greatest triumphs and fumbles with a fascinating reverence. On the other, it is something new for the series, structurally most comparable not to other Metroid games but rather to a different Nintendo adventure franchise (more on that shortly). Then there is how the game is built, feeling almost modular, with different modes and moods of play stitched together with visible seams. With all that said, it certainly - at least broadly - works rather well. Read more"

What makes a great remake?,"Remakes, you either love 'em or hate 'em! Or, more probably, you like some of 'em, aren't too keen on others, and are largely ambivalent to the rest. Whatever your perspective, it's obvious remakes - beloved of risk-averse publishers across the industry - aren't going anywhere. They offer the perfect maelstrom of nostalgia bait and brand recognition, meaning they're an easier sell compared to entirely new games, and if players love them, why stop now? But not all remakes are created equally; for every Resident Evil 2 or Silent Hill 2 , there's an XIII - a remake so bad its publisher was forced to remake it .

"I've returned to last year's brilliant Silent Hill 2 now it's finally on Xbox Series X/S, and it's exactly what a remake should be","I realise I'm probably in the minority here, but I don't love Bluepoint's approach to remakes. Sure, they're pretty, they're technically accomplished, and mechanically faithful to the originals, but the studio's artistic liberties too often rankle. I admit I'm a purist and grumpy old man in the making who hates change, but I still think remakes should, fundamentally, play within the boundaries of the original's creative vision. A colour palette shift - swapping the bleached-out ethereal hues of Shadow of the Colossus on PS2 for a more natural lighting, say - might add a bit of beautification, but it can radically alter the intended tone. More egregiously, Bluepoint's decision to redesign chunks of Demon's Souls using a completely different architectural style isn't just an artistic choice, it has significant ramifications for world-building.

PSVR 2 Horizon Call Of The Mountain Bundle Is Still On Sale For All-Time Best Price,"PSVR 2 Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle $299 (was $400) See at Amazon See at PS Direct See at Walmart See at Best Buy See at Target See at GameStop PSVR 2 PC Adapter $60 See at Amazon See at PS Direct See at Best Buy See at Walmart See at Target See at GameStop There's never been a better time for PS5 owners to add the PlayStation VR 2 to their entertainment center. As part of PlayStation's Holiday Sale , the PSVR 2 Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle is on sale for only $299 at Amazon/Walmart and $300 at PS Direct and other major retailers. Officially, this is a $100 discount, but at the start of 2025, this bundle still carried its original $600 price point. PlayStation permanently dropped the price of the PSVR 2 to $400 in February, and the current deal is the best ever for the impressive virtual reality headset for PS5 and PC. This deal runs through December 18 while supplies last. If you don't yet own a PlayStation 5, you can also save $100 on several different models , including the PS5 Pro , the new PS5 Slim Fortnite Bundles , and even the Ghost of Yotei Limited Edition Bundle with black or gold artwork . If you have a powerful enough gaming PC, you don't actually need a PS5; the PSVR 2 can play SteamVR games if you have the official $60 adapter . PSVR 2 Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle $299 (was $400) This PSVR 2 bundle comes with the headset, two PlayStation Sense Controllers, and a pair of wired earbuds, and a USB-C cable--everything you need to connect and play on PS5. Inside the box, you'll also find a voucher for Horizon Call of the Mountain, one of the platform's most impressive technical showpieces. From a tech perspective, the PSVR 2 is a marked improvement over its predecessor. The the headset has 2000 x 2040 resolution OLED lenses, a 110-degree field of view, eye tracking, 90/120Hz refresh rates, four cameras, and six-axis motion sensing. PlayStation's Sense Controllers utilize the immersive haptics and adaptive triggers found in the PS5 DualSense Controller . It also offers 3D Audio with games that support it. The PSVR 2 isn't wireless like Meta's headsets, but you only need to use one USB-C cable to use it--a stark contrast to the mess of cords needed to operate the PSVR on PS4. Despite its impressive tech, the headset hasn't garnered as wide of an audience as PlayStation likely had hoped. This is apparent when looking at the relatively small lists of upcoming games at any given time. PlayStation itself has only published a few games for the platform, though there are some notable AAA PS5 games with cool PSVR 2 modes, including Gran Turismo 7 and the Resident Evil 4 remake. That said, the PlayStation VR 2 does have a pretty big library thanks to ports of VR games from other platforms. The PlayStation Store has more than 350 compatible games. The library expands exponentially if you have a VR-compatible PC and the accessory below. See at Amazon See at PS Direct See at Walmart PSVR 2 PC Adapter $60 PlayStation added PC support to the PSVR 2 last year, which instantly made the headset one of the most enticing options for PC players. To connect the headset to a gaming PC, you need the PSVR 2 PC Adapter . Once you have the adapter, you can download the free PSVR PC app from Steam to start playing PC VR.

"Roblox Blocked In Russia For ""Negatively Impacting"" Children","Russia has decided to restrict Roblox 's access across the country over child safety concerns, which apparently includes the dissemination of LGBTQIA+ content.

You Probably Won't Guess What Just Outsold Every PS5 And Xbox Console Model In The US,"The Nex Playground is probably the most popular video game console in the US that most people don't even know exists. Case in point: Circana senior director Mat Piscatella has revealed that the cube console focused on motion controls has topped every single PS5 and Xbox SKU for units sold in the US for a holiday week. Nex Playground - The Active Play System $249 See at Amazon See at Walmart See at Target See at Best Buy On BlueSky , Piscatella posted the possibly shocking video game hardware statistics for the week ending November 22. The top-selling hardware option was Switch 2 bundled with Mario Kart World , with the Nex Playground at No. 2. Meanwhile, the PS5 Slim digital edition with 1TB came in third place. Obviously, there are multiple options when choosing a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S--various bundles and hard drive configurations--and each one represents a SKU. So one caveat with Circana's info is that the list isn't showing overall Switch 2, PS5, or Xbox Series X|S units sold. US best-selling hardware SKUs for week ending Nov 22, 2025, ranked on units sold: 1) NS2 Mario Kart World Bundle 2) NEX Playground Interactive Gaming System 3) PS5 Slim Digital 1 TB So that's neat.

Battlefield 6's Winter Offensive Update Is All About Combat Consistency And Responsiveness,"Battlefield 6 is getting a new update called Winter Offensive on December 9, bringing a handful of combat improvements focused on reliability, consistency, and responsiveness in the shooter's various modes.

The 2,651-piece retro arcade cabinet model is on sale for $190 (was $270) at Amazon and Walmart while supplies last. Target actually matched this deal but has since sold out. Technically, the $190 price isn't the all-time low, because Amazon sold it for $189 over the weekend, but it's close enough.. The Pac-Man Arcade launched in June 2023 and almost always sells for full price. Most previous deals sold out fast, so it's somewhat surprising Amazon and Walmart aren't out of stock like Target.

Walmart-Exclusive DualSense Icon Blue Controller Is Back In Stock For $64,"Icon Blue Limited Edition DualSense PS5 Controller $64 (was $85) | Walmart Exclusive See at Walmart The Walmart-exclusive Icon Blue DualSense Controller is back in stock and on sale for $64 (was $85). Launched in October, this eye-catching edition of the official PlayStation controller was first discounted to $64 on November 20 when PlayStation's 2025 Holiday Sale kicked off. Walmart sold out before Black Friday weekend and then restocked it at full price--but now it's back on sale alongside other DualSense models. This deal is supposed to run through December 18, but there's no guarantee Walmart will still have units available by then. Icon Blue Limited Edition DualSense PS5 Controller $64 (was $85) | Walmart Exclusive Inspired by the PS5's LED light when powered on, the Icon Blue DualSense is meant to capture the ""feeling of anticipation and wonder"" whenever you boot up the PlayStation 5. Other small flourishes include Katakana characters on the back and PlayStation's face button shapes (icons) on the touchpad. See at Walmart Icon Blue Limited Edition DualSense Controller The Icon Blue DualSense launched alongside a handful of Walmart-exclusive PlayStation collectibles, including a few Astro Bot products like this 7-inch Golden Captain Vinyl Figure for $20 and a Pillow Plush for only $16.88 . Walmart's listing states the plush is 15 inches, but we bought one and are pleased to report that it's actually 25 inches. If Walmart sells out--the retailer says it has low stock--it's worth noting Amazon has an Astro Bot plush and throw blanket bundle for $25 (was $30) . Walmart-Exclusive Official PlayStation Gear Icon Blue DualSense Controller -- $64 ( $85 ) PlayStation Baseball Jersey -- $20 Astro Bot 25"" Pillow Plush -- $16.88 Astro Bot Golden Captain 7"" Vinyl Figure -- $20 Astro Bot Lenticular Lunchbox -- $20 Astro Bot Mystery Mini Vinyl Figures -- $10 The Last of Us Ellie Mini Backpack -- $30 Twisted Metal Meltz Vinyl Figures -- $12 ( $15 ) If Walmart sells out of the $10 Astro Bot Mystery Mini Figures , you can get one of these figures by picking up the CultureFly Astro Bot Collector's Box at Target for $35. You'll also get a blanket, a beanie, an enamel pin, and a travel tumbler. Target also has an exclusive 16-inch Astro Bot Youtooz plushie for $50 and a Youtooz 4.5-inch Vinyl Figure for $30.

Elden Ring: Nightreign Adds New Patch Ahead Of The Forsaken Hollows DLC,"This week, From Software's Elden Ring Nightreign is expanding with The Forsaken Hollows DLC, which adds two new playable characters , two extra bosses, and a fresh Shifting Earth event. But if you want to play that DLC, then you'll need to add the new Nightreign Version 1.03 patch across PC and consoles. One of the primary changes in this patch is that the trigger conditions for Relic effects have been broadened. The game's passive effects have been increased, which include greater attacking power when using two-handed weapons or armaments, as well as chain attacks, charge attacks, and jump attacks. The Wrath of Gold incantation has been given a power boost, while decreasing the cost to players' FP consumption. There are a number of bug fixes in this patch as well, including one that was teleporting players to the wrong area during the Augur invasion if they were performing a critical hit at the time. Under certain conditions, players weren't able to activate Sites of Grace or Churches, but the notes say the issue has been ""mitigated."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack Restocked At Amazon For $25,"Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack $25.31 (was $30) See at Amazon See at Walmart Another Metroid Amiibo launches this week with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. The third and final Metroid Prime 4 Amiibo, Sylux , is available to order for $30 at Amazon and other major retailers. Like other Amiibo released during the Switch 2 era, all three Metroid Prime 4 Amiibo are more expensive than collectors were used to before 2025. That's why it's refreshing to see Amazon restock the Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack for $25.31 (was $30) . The Dread Amiibo set isn't difficult to find for around MSRP, but it's rare to see it sold by a major retailer. Usually you need to buy it from a third-party seller, but this restock is sold and shipped by Amazon. Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack $25.31 (was $30) The Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack is cool for multiple reasons. For Samus fans, it's one of the few collectibles featuring the bounty hunter's regenerating Varia Suit. The blue-tinged sections on the suit are organic matter from the Fusion Suit. This directly ties back to the events of Metroid Fusion. In the 2002 Game Boy Advance game, Samus was infected by the X parasite. She received the Metroid vaccine, but when Dread starts, her Varia Suit is still in the process of regenerating to its normal form. This Samus Amiibo is cool, but the E.M.M.I. Amiibo might be cooler. One of the most unsettling enemies in franchise history, the Extraplanetary Multiform Mobile Identifier--better known as EMMI--is robot nightmare fuel. Like Samus, the EMMI Amiibo's pose matches official key art. If Amazon sells out, you can buy the Metroid Dread 2-Pack from a third-party seller on Walmart Marketplace for roughly the same price.

Escape From Tarkov Players Are Finally Escaping From Tarkov,"For a game that's been in development since 2012, it was a surprise when Escape from Tarkov finally emerged from early access in November.

"Skyblivion Is Delayed To 2026, But It Already Looks Very Good","The dream of Skyblivion goes back over a decade as a team of fans came together to use The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's engine to fully recreate and re-imagine Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion as a modern RPG. At the beginning of 2023, the team set a 2025 premiere for Skyblivion . However, that's no longer the plan and Skyblivion has been pushed to next year. The good news is that the latest dev video shows off how much has been finished and what remains to be done. Skyblivion lead Rebelzize narrates the video as he offers a guide to where things stand. According to Rebelzize, most of the work has already been done and over 70 volunteer contributors are still hard at work trying to get the ambitious mod across the finish line. When this project was started, The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion was far out of date. Earlier this year, Bethesda released Oblivion Remastered, which could have taken the wind out of this team's project. Instead, Rebelzize and others praised the remaster as a ""win-win"" for the community . In recognition for their work, Bethesda gave copies of Oblivion Remastered to the entire Skyblivion mod team.

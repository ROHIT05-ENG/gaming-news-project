Reanimal review,"It's impossible to talk about Reanimal without talking about Little Nightmares . Developer Tarsier's first game since departing the series that put it on the map (part three was handled elsewhere with middling results ) is so Little Nightmares coded it's difficult to ignore. This is a game of two spindly limbed moppets, Boy and Girl, lost in a hellish, hostile world. Play is structured around recurring boss characters and inevitable crescendo pursuits. And Reanimal even shares many of its predecessor's affectations, from the enigmatic opening tease - here the mouldering mouth of a well opening onto a threatening sky - to the way our precocious protagonists return from death huddled together, as if woken from a premonitory dream.

An hour with Pokopia suggests it might be the best Pokémon spin-off ever - and it's more Viva Pinata than Minecraft or Animal Crossing,"When Pokopia was announced, most people drew a couple of quick comparative conclusions from its first cutesy trailer .

It quickly transpired, also, that the game shares development staff with Dragon Quest Builders, a Minecraft-inspired spin-off of another major turn-based Japanese role-playing franchise. Read more"

Next, a stop-motion animated intro over a glorious town of miniatures. Then! Cut to the interior of a police car; a zombie attack; our hero's gruesome death; a portal opening onto the space-time continuum and a granddad on a motorbike. Romeo Stargazer's resuscitation via the medium of eyeball syringe and big spacehat. More zombies! A love story told in flashback, relayed by an energetic camera gliding across a beautifully illustrated comic book. Romeo's dimension-hopping evil girlfriend Juliet, and his Doc Brown-like granddad inexplicably reborn as a sentient jacket patch.

The first is a detailed stats page, which can be accessed from the inventory, which will let you dig into all the stats relating to your loadout at a micro level. If you want to examine exactly how much damage you can do, all the buffs you've assigned and really examine your equipment's cumulative effects, this will make doing so much easier. Critical hits are also getting a visual upgrade. The enemy health bar flashes on a critcal hit now, and animations are a little ""snappier"", so you'll have a better sense of how often your weapons are doing huge damage.

Call Of Duty: Warzone Mobile Shutdown Date Announced And It's Not Far Away,"Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile will soon be going offline. Activision has announced, through their support site , an end date for the mobile battle royale game, with servers set to shut down on April 17, 2026. That means that the game will remain active for two more months, but will not be playable after this time. This does not come as a huge surprise--Activision ended support for the game in May 2025, and the game has not been available for new players to download since then. Players have not been able to purchase anything in the game since then, and new content has not been made available. In an FAQ posted alongside the announcement, Activision clarified that the game is being taken offline because it ""did not meet our expectations with mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences.""

High On Life 2 Devs See PlayStation As Its Primary Platform Despite Game Pass Deal,"While High on Life 2 and its predecessor both had substantial Xbox Game Pass deals, developer Squanch Games still sees PlayStation as the primary platform for the series. ""That was a no-brainer, like our lead platform is Sony, Steam is right behind it as far as units sold,"" Squanch Games CEO Mike Fridley said of the simultaneous PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC launch for High on Life 2 in an interview with TechRadar . ""Shockingly, even after a delay on the Sony launch [on PS4 and PS5]--because of an exclusivity clause with the first game that Microsoft had--it's [PlayStation] still our lead platform,"" he said elsewhere in the interview. That's surprising when you consider the High on Life games' connection to the Xbox platform and Xbox Game Pass. High on Life was released on Game Pass and as a timed Xbox Series X|S console exclusive in December 2022 before coming to PS4 and PS5 seven months later. Meanwhile, High on Life 2 launched simultaneously on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 on February 13, with the Xbox and PC versions being available through the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate tier .

"Weapons Director Zach Cregger Was Given ""Carte Blanche"" To Reinvent Resident Evil For The Big Screen","Zach Cregger's Resident Evil movie could be a fresh break from its source material, as the Weapons director has been given ""carte blanche"" to do whatever he wanted with the IP. According to Constantin Film CEO Oliver Berben--the company is the primary rights holder and producer of live-action Resident Evil movies--explained that the movie is ""far away from everything that is connected to Resident Evil,"" as the company is aiming to tap into Cregger's unique style for this project. ""With Resident Evil, we have had an incredible journey with one of the most successful international IPs of more than a billion dollars in box office for many years and now we are creating something new, not just a new story idea, but to allow a new generation to take the IP into their own hands and form something different,"" Berben said to Deadline . Usually, video game adaptations cherry-pick from the source material to create something that looks and sounds familiar, but still tells an original story. There are exceptions to the rule--like HBO's The Last of Us TV series, which is mostly faithful to the video games--but most of these projects deviate from the video game IP.

"Yes, God of War Sons Of Sparta Dev Takes Its Name From A Real, Adorable Cat","A God of War 2D action platformer probably wasn't on anyone's bingo card for the recent State of Play livestream , but not only is the game real, but it's also out right now for PS5. God of War: Sons of Sparta is a new project from Mega Cat Studios, a developer with a very cool name and a storied history since its founding in 2015--as well as a heartwarming story behind how it settled on its studio name. On the PlayStation Blog , Mega Cat Studios founder and CEO James Deighan revealed that a real feline helped inspire the identity of the studio. ""We had a beloved cat that I had as a pet that passed. One of our [team members' now-wife] volunteers at a local animal shelter here, and she was serving a few bottle babies. [Bottle babies] are whenever the shelters are completely overburdened with animals, the trained [certified] volunteers can take [cats] home and help raise them,"" Deighan explained. ""I was dealing with some pet-loss heartbreak, as you do, and [the shelter had] this one, really aggressive runt in the litter that we ended up taking home and bottle feeding and spending some time with. That was Mega Cat."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
PS6 Plans Reportedly Thrown Into Uncertainty By AI Hardware Demand,"The ongoing shortage of memory chips--which has been primarily attributed to AI companies buying up available stock--could push the launch of the PS6 console toward the end of the current decade, analysts believe. Speaking to Bloomberg , experts who claim to be familiar with Sony's strategies say that the current demand and rising costs of RAM have led to a ""major upset"" to Sony's plans, as it is now considering pushing the PS6 launch to 2028 or even 2029. This lines up with a January report where a senior analyst claimed that there is a ""high likelihood that the PS6 launch will occur after 2028."" Recently, Sony confirmed that it has enough memory to meet demand for PS5 consoles throughout 2026, but it is planning to negotiate with various suppliers to secure a reliable supply going forward. ""As for securing a supply of memory, we are already in a position to secure the minimum quantity necessary to manage the year-end selling season of next fiscal year--October to December 2026,"" Sony CFO Lin Tao said.

"After 500,000 In Sales, Mewgenics Dev Reiterates Plans To Release On Console; Here's What We Know","Mewgenics is out now on PC, and it's crushing it, with more than 500,000 copies sold in its first 36 hours . The game not only scored positive reviews, but is racking up thousands of concurrent players and in fact made enough money to recoup its development budget after just 180 minutes of availability. But is the game coming to console? No official announcements have been made, but developer Edmund McMillen said back in October 2025 that console ports are coming ""next year,"" referring to 2026. After the big breakout success of Mewgenics recently, McMillen reiterated that Mewgenics is coming to console, and it's getting DLC. The developer has also begun selling merch , which is a smart thing to do given the game is taking off in a big way with more than 100,000 concurrent users on Steam. That's all there is to go on at this stage, so it remains to be seen which specific console platforms may be supported. McMillen's most famous game, 2010's Super Meat Boy, was released on console at launch for Xbox 360, before coming to PS4 in 2015, Wii U in 2016, and Switch in 2018. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Dead By Daylight Movie Will Have ""Relentless Genre Intensity,"" Says Jason Blum","Jason Blum and James Wan's Blumhouse and Atomic Monster lined up a film adaptation of Dead by Daylight in 2023. Nearly three years later, the movie is finally going forward with two screenwriters attached, David Leslie Johnston-McGoldrick and Alexandre Aja. According to Blum, these scribes are bringing the intensity. ""What David and Alexandre bring to Dead by Daylight is a rare balance of character driven storytelling and relentless genre intensity,"" said Blum in a statement via The Hollywood Reporter . ""Drawing from survival horror and psychological terror, their work establishes a world where fear is not just experienced, but earned. It is a cinematic blueprint designed to attract a director who can elevate that vision through performance and scale."" As alluded to by Blum, the project doesn't currently have a director even though Aja has two decades of experience behind the camera. Aja previously wrote and directed Crawl, Piranha 3D, and the 2003 remake of The Hills Have Eyes. He is unavailable to direct Dead by Daylight due to his commitment to helm Under Paris 2 for Netflix. Johnston-McGoldrick has written or co-written three of the Conjuring movies, both Aquaman films, and the upcoming sequel, Insidious: The Bleeding World. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Spider-Man To Xbox? ""Not Likely,"" Says Insomniac","The console wars may not be as heated as they used to be, but it doesn't mean Sony is going to let key franchises like Spider-Man go to Xbox Series X|S. When asked about the possibility about bringing the Spider-Man games to Xbox, Insomniac--the studio behind all three of Sony's Spider-Man titles to date--had a blunt response: ""Not likely."" Although the original post posing the question was deleted from X, Insomniac's reply is still online. Insomniac Games say it is “not likely” that Marvel’s Spider-Man will come to Xbox https://t.co/bH09zK7CIf pic.twitter.com/6eDV85Pytj — Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) February 14, 2026 An Xbox port may not be in the cards, but the Spider-Man games have come to PC.

Layers Of Fear 3 Announced With A Spooky Live-Action Trailer,"A third mainline game in the Layers of Fear series, Layers of Fear 3, has been announced by developer Bloober Team. The sequel was announced in a video celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the original Layers of Fear . It contains a lot of tone-setting footage, set to a spooky rendition of ""You Are My Sunshine"" - there's nothing particularly scary in the video, but it's a little unsettling. Bloober Team CEO Piotr Babieno promises in the video that the Layers of Fear series is ""still alive, still evolving, and still finding new ways to haunt"".

All Skills In The Sims 4 And How To Improve Them,"Just like with human beings, there are a lot of different things a Sim can be good at. These things are known as skills, and The Sims 4 has amassed more than four dozen of them over the past decade, with new expansions and game packs gradually adding in new ones. At this point, the options are legion--there are more skills than most of us probably even remember. And each new expansion adds more of them--the new fairy-focused expansion, Enchanted by Nature, even added two surprisingly novel new skills for your Sims to train in. Even without adding more using The Sims 4 mods , we're practically drowning in skills these days. Every skill in The Sims 4 has related activities that your Sims can do to improve that skill, but there are also things a Sim can do that will increase their gains in any skill. There are several aspiration rewards you can take that will make your sim gain skills faster--Night Owl and Morning Sim will increase your skill gains at night and in the morning, respectively, and Savant will give you a 25% boost to all skill gains permanently. Taking these perks is always recommended. Likewise, there are skill books that will help you Sim learn a skill by reading about it. But your Sim won't max out any skills that way. Theory is good, but it can't beat actually doing it. So if you want your Sims to master a skill, they'll need to get their hands dirty. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
How MGS's Solid Snake Joined Rainbow Six Siege,"Solid Snake is coming to Rainbow Six Siege. Not as a skin for an already-existing character, but a fully-fledged operator with his own unique loadout and play style. When GameSpot talked to Ubisoft Montreal about the future of Siege for our 10th anniversary documentary , we didn't quite imagine a crossover of this magnitude. Although Ubisoft's Siege team has done crossovers in the past, this is the first time a character outside of Ubisoft's Tom Clancy universe has joined Team Rainbow. I sat down with key developers from Ubisoft and Konami to learn how a collaboration like this comes about and why Solid Snake is a perfect fit for Rainbow Six Siege. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
David Hayter Will Voice Solid Snake In Rainbow Six Siege Crossover,"David Hayter, the actor who originated the voice of Solid Snake in the Metal Gear Solid franchise, will reprise his role for the character's upcoming appearance in Rainbow Six Siege .

""For us, it was really a core objective to get Hayter for the English VO,"" creative director Joshua Mills told GameSpot. ""Because it's just, again, very iconic, and we really wanted to be able to deliver that as far as the English VO."" Mills and content director Christopher Budgen confirmed that the team tried to incorporate Snake's signature cardboard box into the game. It just didn't quite work very well in the world of Rainbow Six Siege. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"All Careers In The Sims 4: Jobs, Tips, And How To Get Promoted","There are a lot of different jobs to choose from in The Sims 4, including a pretty robust group of careers included with the base game and plenty more that have been added via DLC over the decade-plus that The Sims 4 has been out. What jobs you have your sims sign up for is totally up to you, but there are a lot of factors that can affect your performance, like whether your sim's skills are appropriate for the job you want. If you want your sims to be successful, some knowledge and effort are required--just like it is with a real job. And that goes triple for the new Noble career in The Sims 4: Royalty & Legacy, which works differently than any previous Sims 4 career . While there are specific things you'll need to know about each individual career that can help you get ahead, there are also some universal tips that can help your sims climb their corporate ladders. Table of Contents [ hide ] General tips for any Sims 4 career Pick an active, self-employment, or rabbit hole job General tips for any Sims 4 career Pick an active, self-employment, or rabbit hole job There are three main types of careers in The Sims 4. Most of them are rabbit hole-type jobs, where your sims just go offscreen and do their thing without any meaningful input from the player. But there are also ""active"" careers, where you follow your sim to their place of business and you'll have to make them do various tasks (though you can also play these as rabbit hole jobs if you'd prefer), and self-employment and freelance careers where your sim will complete individual gigs from the comfort of their homes, like writing a book, painting a picture, or building furniture.

Capcom Restores Free Viewing Option For Street Fighter World Championship After Backlash,"Capcom has announced that its plan for the Capcom Cup finals and Street Fighter League World Championship as a $40 pay-per-view have been reworked to include a cheaper price and a free viewing option following a backlash from Street Fighter 6 fans. Prior to this year, the Capcom Cup finals and Street Fighter League World Championship were free-to-watch events. However, Capcom's decision to move the event to pay-per-view only triggered an angry response from fans. In the face of that response, Capcom backed down. Capcom's eSports business department manager Tetsuya Tabuchi made the announcement on X (via GamesRadar ) that the pay-per-view price is now $10. Players who own Street Fighter 6 will also be able to stream the Capcom Cup finals and Street Fighter League World Championship in-game.

How To Become Ruler In The Sims 4: Royalty And Legacy,"The newest expansion for The Sims 4 , Royalty and Legacy, introduces some major new wrinkles to the way this digital world works. The main one is that your Sims can now become ruler of the city they live in and start a dynasty that can solidify the family's power for generations. Since the Royalty and Legacy expansion is fueled by pretty much entirely new mechanics, it's not actually that obvious how to get started on the road to power. But that's what we're here for. Table of Contents [ hide ] It's all about the nobles It's all about the nobles A Sim who wants to rule must be a noble, and unless your Sim is literally a dynasty's heir to the throne, that means partaking in the Noble career. Being a professional noble is very different from any other career in The Sims 4, because it's a 24/7 gig. Everything your Sim does can hypothetically affect their status. And this career isn't one you can join with a phone call. To start things off, you'll need to one of three options: request a knighthood from a noble who likes your Sim; choose the Research Nobility option on the book The Duchess Diaries: A History of Nobility, which is stocked on every bookshelf; or buy a throne in build mode and simply declare your Sim a noble.

CoD: Black Ops 7 And Warzone Patch Notes Detail Weapon And Attachment Changes,"A new update has arrived to Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 and Warzone on February 13, and the patch notes detail weapon balancing across both games. These weapon adjustments include changes to sniper rifles and light machine guns, as well as tuning of specific gun attachments. Season 2 went live in Call of Duty on February 5, but the patch notes didn't include the usual weapon balancing pass typically found in seasonal updates. Instead, Treyarch saved the gun changes for this new update, which focuses on various guns and attachments. For Black Ops 7's multiplayer and Zombies, the update includes a notable buff for the DS20 Mirage assault rifle. This increases the damage range for the gun, and it also makes improvements to the weapon's 17.1"" Abdicator Barrel attachment, allowing for less recoil penalty when it's equipped.

"Blizzard President Looks To The Future And Admits ""Not Everything's Going To Hit""","This year marks the 35th anniversary of Blizzard, and the company already has reason to celebrate the recent Overwatch rebrand that's revitalized the hero shooter. Blizzard President Johanna Faries is very optimistic about the company's future, but she's also fully aware that not every swing at the plate will work out in its favor. ""We've set a lot in motion with respect to [the future of Blizzard], making sure we're clear on it, making sure we’re coordinated on it,"" said Faries during an appearance on the Official Xbox Podcast . ""There's sort of a reliability that players can depend on us to launch in big ways, launch in surprising ways. Maybe take some zags! Not everything's going to hit. That's gaming. But in many ways, let's understand where we are going--not only as a company, but by franchise, by game."" Faries may be referring to some Blizzard games that were in development but never saw the light of day. In 2019, Blizzard reportedly canceled a StarCraft shooter after two years in development in order to focus on Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Diablo 4: Lord Of Hatred Is Completely Removing Passive Skills,"Diablo 4's Lord of Hatred expansion is revamping class skill trees, with its most dramatic change being the removal of passive skills entirely. As revealed during an official Sanctuary Sitdown on Discord with members of the Diablo 4 development team (via Icy Veins ), Blizzard is looking to make it so class skill trees are more about offering customization than raw power spikes. As a result, passive skill nodes are being removed. Each active skill will be receiving new customizations options to help fill some of those power gaps, but overall Blizzard wants to make it so becoming more powerful is more about finding and crafting better gear, leveling up the Paragon Board, and equipping the right Legendary aspects as opposed to ticking flat damage bonus boxes on the skill tree. In total, there are 80 additional new skill options and 40 reworked ones that will be coming to all Diablo 4 players. Lord of Hatred owners will have 20 additional skill choices to choose from.

Death Stranding 2 Concept Art Reveals Sam’s Lost Turtleneck Phase,"Death Stranding 2: On the Beach isn't exactly subtle in its themes, as the story is clearly influenced by COVID, lockdowns, and travel restrictions in place during the early years of the coronavirus outbreak. Originally, game director Hideo Kojima had an entirely different story in mind, but after the COVID pandemic began in 2020, he began to rethink his approach to the topic of connection. So what did Death Stranding 2 originally look like? For starters, it would have involved a lot more high-end fashion for its protagonist, Sam Porter Bridges, and his allies. Kojima recently posted images online from the upcoming Death Stranding 2 art book , showing off a ""pre-COVID"" look at Bridges and Fragile. Bridges is wearing a stylish suit and turtleneck instead of his usual timefall resistant porter outfit--the look was inherited by another character in the game--while Fragile is decked out in some killer fashion that references her original outfit from Death Stranding.

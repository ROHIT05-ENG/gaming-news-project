Skate Story review,"It's been almost twenty years since I lived in New York City, but there's something sorcerous about meeting art that can so fiercely resurrect such a deeply personal time and place for an audience of one. Skate Story is one of these experiences; and for even more reasons, it's easily an all-timer of a game. Sure, my hands are two rigid claws, my pre-arthritic joints are flaring up like a Guy Fawkes bonfire. My janky left shoulder is twinging, as it does when I get caught up doing computery things, and my heart is beating in the heels of my palms from deathgripping my controller. Frankly, this is just how movement-intense, combo-centric gaming feels when you're not a svelte, well-oiled machine anymore. I'm a desk jockey made of SSRIs and pain, and I must skate. Read more"

And then it hit me. Not 20 minutes earlier, I'd explicitly printed out my own ID card and pinned it to my chest - all the game wanted me to do was look down. Read more"

How Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Fails The Genre Nintendo Created,"New Metroid games are few and far between, so the launch of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond should have been a monumental event for the fanbase. Instead, eight years after its announcement, and 18 years after the previous game, Nintendo’s big December 2025 release landed with a loud thud. Already, this once highly anticipated title is poised to be one of the series' most divisive games, earning a spot alongside Other M and Federation Force. This isn't for lack of polish, as Prime 4 is indeed visually stunning and perhaps the greatest first-party showcase of graphics on the Nintendo Switch and its successor. But while it has its share of enthusiasts, it’s difficult not to feel underwhelmed by the final product in comparison to prior Prime games and even other, similar entries in the Metroidvania space that has grown in Nintendo’s frequent absence. The list of Metroidvania games from independent and third-party developers in the past decade alone is astonishing, with Ori and the Blind Forest, Axiom Verge, Hollow Knight, Dead Cells, Animal Well, and others throwing new concepts and innovations into the genre’s well of ideas. Hollow Knight and its follow-up, Silksong, have captivated players with their dense worldbuilding, roaming NPCs, and optional side objectives, all of which have come to define the critically acclaimed series. Nine Sols stood out with its intricate combat system, while more out-there games like pinball Metroidvania Yoku’s Island Express have proven anything can be a Metroidvania with the right amount of determination and creativity. Even Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown changed the game with something as simple as an in-game screenshot system to help with backtracking. The Metroidvania genre is rapidly iterating with a volume of unique takes. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Star Wars: Fate Of The Old Republic Is Probably Many Years Away From Release,"The release of the upcoming RPG Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is likely far, far away. While last night's announcement trailer at The Game Awards 2025 was surely exciting for Knights of the Old Republic fans, the truth is that the game, led by original KOTOR and Mass Effect director Casey Hudson, is in a very early stage of development. According to the official Star Wars website , Hudson's new studio, Arcanaut Studios, was formed just this year, after his previous studio closed in November 2024. The studio's careers page contains listings for several senior-level positions, so the announcement trailer also doubles as a recruitment advertisement, a tactic that developers often employ . With the lengthy development cycles that high-profile games undergo these days, we're probably years away from seeing anything concrete from Fate of the Old Republic, and even further from a release. Skepticism about the game even releasing this decade is quite reasonable. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"Gears Of War: E-Day Is Still Coming In 2026, Microsoft Assures Fans","Gears of War fans hoping to see a new trailer for the upcoming prequel, Gears of War: E-Day , may have been disappointed that it skipped The Game Awards this year. That may be why the official Gears of War social media accounts have shared a message assuring fans that E-Day is still coming in 2026. The image shared on the Gears of War X account didn't share any spoilers and it was just a skull set against some haunting red and black shades. But it did confirm the 2026 release window.

Cliff Bleszinski--the co-creator of the franchise--has mentioned that he's happy that the Gears of War games are no longer exclusive to a single console. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"IWGB Union Says Rockstar's Statement Is Filled With ""Disinformation"" Over Fired Developers","The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has shot back at Rockstar Games regarding the firing of 30+ staffers, saying that the company's latest statement is ""littered with falsehoods and disinformation."" IWGB released a statement clarifying its take on Rockstar Games' justification for terminating the 30+ UK and international employees in October 2025. Parent company Take-Two Interactive explained that the GTA developer fired those workers for ""gross misconduct, and for no other reason."" More specifically, Rockstar Games told GameSpot that those developers were let go for discussing ""specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles"" and other ""confidential information"" in a public forum. IWGB took issue with that, telling GameSpot that the characterization is inaccurate. ""Rockstar's latest statement is littered with falsehoods and disinformation--they have given multiple, conflicting reasons to explain why the workers were fired, as if attempting to reverse engineer a rationale for the dismissals,"" the union said in an emailed statement. ""Once again, they have chosen to mischaracterise workers speaking about their working conditions in a private forum as 'leaking information.' It is hard to understand this statement as anything but a desperate attempt to deflect from the global scrutiny they have come under over the last month.

Nitro Deck 2 For Nintendo Switch 2 Revealed,"CRKD Nitro Deck 2 $100 | Releases Spring 2026 Smokey Black White The Switch 2 is a fun console, but one of its shortcomings is that it's not the most ergonomic device for handheld play. That's where CRKD is looking to switch things up, as the company has announced the Nitro Deck 2 for Switch 2 consoles, priced at $100. Even better, it's compatible with the Switch 1 and is scheduled to launch in Spring 2026 in two colorways: White and Smoke Black. CRKD Nitro Deck 2 $100 | Releases Spring 2026 Like the original Nitro Deck, the Nitro Deck 2 is designed to be an all-in-one add-on to the Switch 2. The cradle uses a retractable locking mechanism to ensure a tight fit with Switch consoles, and it replaces the Joy-Cons on the sides. The built-in controllers are contoured to fit more naturally in your hands, and they feature an offset right thumbstick for a more ergonomic feel. The console tablet is now held in place with a retractable locking dial located on the rear. It also comes with a legacy adapter for Switch 1 and Switch OLED consoles, as well as another adapter to enable low-latency wired handheld play. The capsticks on this model aren't Hall Effect sticks, but CRKD claims they can deliver ultra-responsive control, adjustable resistance, and immunity to magnetic interference thanks to a zero-contact design. Programmable back buttons can also be found on the rear of the Nitro Deck 2, which have been expanded to include L2 and R2 buttons. You can also customize the joysticks with swappable tops, and the triggers have been upgraded to tactile Digital Triggers. The cradle is rounded off with a durable metal kickstand and motion control compatibility. When not in use with a Switch console, it can be used as a wireless or wired controller for PC, mobile devices, and smart TVs. Smokey Black White CRKD Nitro Deck 2 If you're looking to get something right away for your Switch 1 console, the current CRKD Nitro Deck and Nitro Deck+ come highly recommended. These are priced from around $50 - $60 each, and they come in a wide variety of colors like black, PAL grey, and a retro-inspired purple. The regular Nitro Deck features full-size Hall Effect analog sticks and triggers, a conventional D-pad, four remappable back buttons, motion controls, rumble, turbo function, curved handles, and is compatible with both the standard and OLED Switch models. The Nitro Deck+ has a similar setup, but the key differences with this model include HDMI out support via the USB-C port so that you can put the Switch in docked mode without having to remove it from the cradle, a symmetrical thumbstick layout, an eject function to make removing the screen easier, and improved rumble effects.

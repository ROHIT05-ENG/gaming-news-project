"Penises set Dispatch apart, and I mean that quite sincerely","I think a lot of Dispatch can be distilled into a single moment at the beginning of the game when the player comes face to face with a penis. There it is, dangling visibly between the legs of an unclothed, toxic-drenched super-villain you're about to fight. The camera all but centers on it. There's no way you can miss it unless you've flipped the nudity switch off, in which case it's replaced by an even more conspicuous black box that only amplifies the naughtiness of the part hidden within. But most people don't turn nudity off because they're expecting boobs. That's what we usually see. In Dispatch, however, it's a penis we see waggling unavoidably on our screens. Read more"
"Donkey Kong Bananza might not be the best game of the year, but it's surely the one I loved the most","I think these days, after years of Nintendo outright eschewing the console power rat race and focusing instead on different ways to play and honing their core craft, we forget that Nintendo is still a pretty sharp company in terms of technical innovation. Raw power went aside with the Wii, but the company's dedication to tinkering around the edges to create stand-out original experiences in other ways remained - or perhaps even intensified. There's been a lot of examples over the years, of course, from clever game design innovations to zany peripherals - but Donkey Kong Bananza has to be one of the finest showcases of that thinking from Nintendo in years.

Who saw that coming… Seriously though, let me tell you about a little downside of my job: if we're covering a game, or considering doing so, I have to spoil everything for myself for planning purposes. End-game boss? Spoiled. Every collectible location and what happens after you've collected every magic hat or whatever? Spoiled. Plot twists, because I might as well go all in at this point? Spoiled. If I don't learn it before the game comes out, I'll certainly know about it shortly after release thanks to research. (I learned what happened to Zelda in Tears of the Kingdom via Google Trends. Google bloody Trends .) Read more"
Skin Deep was this year's reminder that it's a privilege to recognise a developer's handwriting,"Out in space there are objects that orbit one another for so long, and at such a stately pace, that when they both eventually arrive at the same point, they don't collide with some kind of awful explosion. Instead, they just touch. They graze. They fuse. It's all very gentle. And then, over time, the two objects become one. Read more"
"In 2025, Winter Burrow showed how a little kindness goes a long way","In a loud world where everyone is battling to be heard, it's easy to forget that the quiet and smaller moments of kindness hold the most power. A lot of the time, it's easy to think that keeping to yourself is the easiest way to deal with things, whether you're dealing with your own pain or trying to find the right way to navigate someone else's. It's never easy to know what to do, we're all trying our best - after all this is all our first time being human. But one truth remains:a little kindness goes a long way. Winter Burrow, the intrepid little mouse game, shows this more than anything else I've played in 2025. Read more"

Eurogamer's Alternate Game Awards 2025,"The year is over! Or near enough. Sound the refrain that has become all too familiar over the last few years: What a: year for videogames/nightmare/success/disaster. This might be the only time on Eurogamer I can get away with using the old cliche 'mixed bag', hey.

Blades of Fire and Hideo Kojima showed me I can still be surprised by a video game and that originality is essential,"I am pretty confident in my ability to judge video games. I've been playing them (increasingly badly over more recent years!) for almost 40 years and writing about them for over 20, so it's rare that something blindsides me. But that's exactly what happened with Blades of Fire , the action soulslike adventure from Mercury Steam. I loved the studio's Castlevania rethink, Lords of Shadow, but was so-so on its output since, including the Nintendo-published Metroid Dread . My expectations for Blades of Fire were low to moderate.

"AI VTuber Neuro-Sama Has Only Gone And Done It Again, Smashing Another World Record","Twitch Hype Train world records are a rare thing. The ultimate show of dedication from a creator's fanbase, these accumulative trains rely on a streamer's viewers donating subscriptions or Bits to the channel. Neuro-sama beat her own world record at the end of December 2024 and now, well, she's only gone and done it again. The hat trick of Hype Train world records belongs to the AI VTuber, her sister Evil Neuro, and their creator Vedal987 . For the uninitiated, or those outside of the ""Swarm""--the name for Neuro's fanbase--Neuro is an AI VTuber created by Vedal who utilizes a large language model and a VTuber model to communicate with her Twitch chat, play games, and even go on adventures in VR thanks to the 3D version of her model. Neuro was originally created to play the rhythm game OSU on Twitch, but rapidly evolved to become a series of AI systems that work in harmony. Vedal created a program that takes its input from Twitch and voice, gives that input to the LLM, which is then sent to a text-to-speech system, resulting in the Neuro we know today. It's for that reason that Neuro is widely considered far from the ""AI slop"" that many people take issue with. It's possibly a combination of the complexity of that system, the resulting effects, or the opinion that Neuro-Sama is the cutest little button, that has led Vedal to gain such a dedicated fanbase. On January 4, seemingly out of nowhere, Neuro once again began to see an impressive number of Bits and subscriptions donated to Vedal's channel. Vedal's friend and fellow VTuber Camila offered to commission a new outfit for Neuro if the Hype Train continued. She also promised to ""show feet"" but we won't talk about that. These incentives led the hype train to level 100 in a matter of a few hours, and it didn't stop there. Vedal wasn't present with Neuro on stream for this attempt, instead choosing to type in chat with sentiments such as ""Realistically wtf is going on?"" and ""I was gonna join after the train, but it's getting a bit silly.""

"Award-Winning Sci-Fi Series Children Of Time Gets New Box Set, And Amazon's Launch Discount Is Wild","Children of Time 3-Book Hardcover Box Set $29 (was $90) | Releases January 6 See at Amazon See at Barnes and Noble Children of Strife: Children of Time, Book 4 (Hardcover) $28 (was $30) | Releases March 17 Preorder at Amazon Science fiction fans can save big on a box set edition of one of the most popular series of the past decade. The first three books in Adrian Tchaikovsky's Children of Time series have been reissued in hardcover, and Amazon has marked the price all the way down to $29 (was $90). The 68% discount is one of the largest we've seen for a brand-new book box set. The Children of Time Hardcover Box Set releases January 6. Amazon's deal is especially noteworthy because Children of Time Books 1-3 were out of print in hardcover and sell for high prices on the reseller market. And with the fourth novel in the series slated for publication March 17 , fans and new readers can now have matching editions of all four Children of Time novels. Even for new readers, the box set costs less than you'd spend on the paperback editions (roughly $39). Children of Time 3-Book Hardcover Box Set $29 (was $90) | Releases January 6 Children of Time is a space opera chronicling humanity's migration from an uninhabitable Earth to a terraformed exoplanet. The only problem with this plan is that their new home has been occupied by genetically modified spiders for thousands of years. These arachnoids evolved and thrived with the help of an AI version of a human who worked on the terraforming project. The 2015 novel won the Arthur C. Clarke Award. The 2019 sequel Children of Ruin won the BSFA Award for Best Novel. Children of Memory, the third book in the series, was published in 2023, the same year Children of Time received the Hugo Award for Best Series. In addition to the strangely low price, there's another peculiar detail about the Children of Time Box Set: The advertised page count appears to be way underselling the length of the first three books. Store pages at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and several other retailers list the page count for the box set as 1,136. This is almost certainly a typo, because the total page count for the hardcover editions of Books 1-3 is 1,664. Children of Time is 608 pages; Children of Ruin is 576 pages; and Children of Memory is 480 pages. It's possible that the new hardcover editions aren't exactly the same as the originals, but the books appear to be roughly the same length and width, so the total page count should be somewhere around 1,700. Paperback Editions Children of Time -- $12 ( $20 ) Children of Ruin -- $13.66 ( $20 ) Children of Memory -- $12.89 ( $20 ) See at Amazon See at Barnes and Noble Children of Strife: Children of Time, Book 4 (Hardcover) $28 (was $30) | Releases March 17 Children of Strife, the fourth entry in the series, is available to preorder for $28 (was $30) in hardcover . The 496-page novel will also be available in ebook and audiobook formats at launch. If you'd like to listen to the audiobook versions of the first three novels , it's worth noting that Children of Time Book 1 is exclusive to Audible. Preorder at Amazon More fiction by Adrian Tchaikovsky Children of Time isn't Tchaikovsky's only ongoing fantasy series. The fourth novel in the prolific British author's dark fantasy series The Tyrant Philosophers will be published March 10, just one week before the fourth novel in Children of Time.

Dispatch's Best Surprise Is In Its Name,"Quick-time events, despite everyone's best efforts to spice them up, remain pretty meh . When you first begin Dispatch, the new episodic superhero adventure game from AdHoc Studio, you're asked if you want to enable quick-time event prompts as an optional game mechanic. It says something that these QTE prompts only really appear in the first and last episode of Dispatch's eight-episode run. But if you're worried the only input you'll have in Dispatch is pressing a button at the right time, or picking the different narrative choices that affect the game's story, you should know AdHoc has a more compelling, non-optional gameplay hook that deserves as much attention as the game's charming storytelling. And it's in the title of the game itself. Set in a fictional version of Los Angeles, California where superheroes are real, Dispatch centers on Robert Robertson III, a former hero turned dispatcher for SDN. It's a private security and service company, except instead of sending paramedics out, SDN (or Superhero Dispatch Network) sends out caped heroes to tackle clients' problems big and small. This serves as the basis for Dispatch's core minigame, and it's one that could honestly be a standalone game in and of itself. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

The Magic Of Peak Is Its Lost-like Lore,"Four scouts on an end-of-year trip, flying across the world for what should be a life-changing experience. What could go wrong? An engine malfunction. The squad crash-lands somewhere in the Pacific. They’re the only survivors on a mysterious island that only grows stranger the deeper they venture and the longer they stay. This is Peak . Sound familiar? The stories of Lost, the Emmy-winning 2004 mystery-laden drama series, and Peak feel like two parallel tracks that move in an eerily similar and magnificent way. The mystery only grows--in both depth and complexity--the further you get, whether you’re marathoning episodes or climbing up a volcano in search of rescue. Lost worked because of that mystery. A group that crash-landed on an isolated island runs into underground bunkers, hidden groups of strangers, and a smoke monster as they try to survive and find their way home. Every new discovery widens the gap between what you think you understand and what’s actually happening. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
The Mojave Wasteland Is Broken Beyond Repair In Fallout Season 2 Episode 3,"Spoilers for this week's episode of Fallout to follow. This week’s Fallout episode gave audiences a look into the status quo of the factions fighting for control of the Mojave Wasteland. While gamers might have an idea of where they ended up after finishing Fallout: New Vegas, it seems that a lot has changed in the wasteland in the 15 years since. While the meter didn’t move too much on individual stories, it was great to see what some of these fan favorite factions are currently up to. The episode opens up in a bottling plant for the infamous Sunset Sarsaparilla, the Mojave’s favorite drink. The plant is being operated under the watchful eye of none other than former Brotherhood of Steel Squire Thaddeus (Johnny Pemberton), who’s taking on a far more ghoulish look than when we last saw him. After consoling a young girl who was bullied, he reminds the children to get back to work and that normally they’d “be dead by now.” Continue Reading at GameSpot"
This Week’s Fallout Episode Brought Back A Fan-Favorite Character,"This week’s Fallout episode traded in personal stories for status updates on fan-favorite factions from Fallout: New Vegas. While we briefly saw the Khans and primary followed the Brotherhood of Steel storyline, we finally got caught up with the NCR and Caesar’s Legion. With this expansion of the Mojave Wasteland, this episode had a healthy dose of easter eggs and callbacks for fans of the video games. Let’s take a look at what this week had to offer. The Mojave’s Favorite Soda This week’s episode revealed the fate of Squire Thaddeus (Johnny Pemberton) and his new life as a ghoul. Instead of exploring the wasteland as part of the Brotherhood of Steel, he’s running a bottling plant that employs an army of abandoned children. The drink they’re bottling? Sunset Sarsaparilla, the most popular drink on the west coast in the Fallout games and a common consumable item in Fallout: New Vegas. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Lego Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse Minifigure Mystery Box Restocked At Amazon,"Lego Minifigures - Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse 6-Pack $30 | Restocked January 1 See at Amazon Sold out at Target Sold out at Walmart Sold out at Lego Store Spider-Man fans have another opportunity to pick up Lego Spider-Verse minifigure mystery boxes for retail price at Amazon. After selling out in the lead-up to Christmas and again on New Year's Eve, the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Minifigure 6-Pack is available for $30 at Amazon on January 1. Resellers have been selling Spider-Verse mystery boxes for around $50, so Amazon will probably sell out again soon. While you're on Amazon, you should also check out the newly released Miles Morales Mech vs. Spider-Man 2099 Lego set , which is only $15 and is also based on Across the Spider-Verse; it's one of 12 new Lego Marvel models and playsets available at Amazon. If you're interested in collecting this Lego minifigure series, now's the time to grab a box or two. Spider-Verse minifigures are sold out at all other major retailers and the Lego Store. Most retailers sold out shortly after the collection launched in September and never restocked the mystery boxes or singles. And with the new Lego Minifigure Animal Series 28 Collection now available, it's unlikely the Spider-Verse minifigures stick around for much longer. The Spider-Verse Lego minifigure collection includes 12 characters from the animated film series. Each minifigure comes with a stand and most also have an accessory. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

See at Amazon See at Best Buy See at Lego Store Eight new Harry Potter Lego sets launched this week at Amazon , the Lego Store , Best Buy , and other major retailers. Longtime fans of the franchise will want to pay special attention to the 25th Anniversary sets. To mark the anniversary of the Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone film adaptation, Lego designed five models and playsets that call back to the 2001 movie. The star of the lineup is the Lego Harry Potter 25th Anniversary Sorcerer's Stone Collector's Edition , a 1,571-piece display model featuring iconic characters, objects, and scenes from the movie.

"The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy Is The Ultimate ""What If"" Game","At the beginning of 2025, I fully believed I had grown tired of stories about multiple timelines. During the past decade, the Marvel Cinematic Universe pushed the classic comic book narrative device into the mainstream, fueling a film conglomerate with legally approved cameos, flashy visuals on the silver screen, and loose plots that, eventually, came together for one final pay-off. While the concept of the multiverse has been explored in film and TV even before Marvel's takeover, it quickly became the narrative foundation of choice. When done right, the potential is undeniable--works like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and Everything, Everywhere, All at Once are heartwrenching displays of interpersonal relationships, making characters face the reality of what-if scenarios, reconciling with their choices and what could have been if they had turned the other way instead. But you can only hear the same tune so many times before it starts to lose its original impact. It wasn't until The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy that my interest was reanimated. The visual novel and strategy-RPG hybrid presents itself as deceivingly linear, only to push you into a completely different story structure at the very end. It makes for a sprawling web of outcomes based on your choices, all while showcasing different perspectives on events and characters that weave absurdity and sentimentality in equal measure in a showcase of creative prowess from the development team.

Best Of 2025: Avowed's Most Controversial Feature Is Also One Of Its Best,"Obsidian's Avowed is one of the better action-RPGs released in 2025. While it doesn't reinvent any particular wheel, it benefits from an engaging campaign, fun combat systems, and charming characters. Aside from the occasional bug--a common element of Obsidian's open-world games--and an overabundance of homicidal bears, I liked nearly everything about the game. That includes Avowed's most controversial game mechanic: enemy respawns, or the lack thereof. When it comes to RPGs, players often think of a few key elements. Some sort of leveling system, quest-granting NPCs, obtainable loot that bolsters certain ""builds"" or playstyles--you know, the basics. One feature that's common but maybe not as notable, considering its use in other genres, is respawning enemies. Players often expect areas to repopulate with baddies whenever they return to a given location. Avowed isn't about that life though--at least, not entirely. Avowed is designed to respond to your actions in meaningful ways, and not just during key moments, where certain decisions can change the direction of the game's story. This also applies to Avowed's enemies. Essentially, most of the outlaws, walking mushrooms, and crazed bears you'll run into during your journey, won't return after being killed. Laid waste to a group of Xaurips while wandering through the forest? Don't worry. They'll still be dead on return trips. Slain a few dozen Spiderlings in an underground lair? They won't be resurrected anytime soon, either. Rinse and repeat--or rather, don't repeat. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

New Tom And Jerry Golden Era Anthology Is Back In Stock With A Great Discount,"Tom and Jerry: The Golden Era Anthology (Blu-ray) $46.79 (was $60) Get deal at Amazon Tom and Jerry: The Golden Era Anthology is on sale for a nice discount at Amazon. The newly released Blu-ray collection is up for grabs for $46.79 (was $60) . The Golden Era Anthology compiles over 100 classic animated shorts starring the iconic duo. The six-disc box set also comes with a wealth of bonus features and a physical sketchbook. The Golden Era Anthology is also available on DVD for $46.79 (was $55), though it doesn't include the bonus content disc or sketchbook. Warner Bros. released The Golden Era Anthology on December 2 to celebrate Tom and Jerry's 85th anniversary. Unsurprisingly, this awesome collection quickly became a bestseller when preorders opened in September. Though Amazon's store page notes a $60 MSRP, the retailer has listed the collection for as high as $66.49. Amazon previously offered the $46.79 deal in mid-December, but it disappeared within a day. Tom and Jerry: The Golden Era Anthology (Blu-ray) $46.79 (was $60) Part of the Warner Archive Collection, The Golden Era Anthology features 114 theatrical shorts across six discs. The shorts were restored in 1080p resolution and support DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0. Three of the shorts have stereo audio, while the rest are mono. The box set collects nearly 20 years of Tom and Jerry history. The animated shorts, which played before feature films, originally appeared in theaters from 1940 through 1958. All 114 shorts are presented in chronological order, and three of them--Casanova Cat, Mouse Cleaning, and His Mouse Friday--were completely remastered for the first time. The Golden Era Anthology's sixth disc is loaded with bonus content, including audio commentaries narrated by animation experts, featurettes, and extra shorts. Two of the featurettes are exclusive to this release: Lady of the House: The Story of Mammy Two Shoes and Animal Hijinks: The Friends and Foes of Tom. The included physical sketchbook features archival character art and designs. Special Features 20 audio commentaries 9 classic featurettes 2 new featurettes 3 bonus animated shorts 32-page sketchbook All told, The Golden Era Anthology includes approximately 20 hours of content. The cover art features Tom in his Zoot suit from the 1944 animated short The Zoot Cat. Get deal at Amazon Tom and Jerry: The Golden Era Anthology The Golden Era Anthology is notable for including two remastered shorts that had never received home media releases in the US: Mouse Cleaning and Casanova Cat. These are controversial Tom and Jerry episodes due to them being racially insensitive, and while they were scheduled to appear in Tom and Jerry: The Golden Collection Volume Two, that release was ultimately canceled. Older--and extremely dated--content like this has appeared in several other Warner Archive releases over the years, as the company has added disclaimers to these shorts to indicate their historical context, problematic nature, and racially insensitive jokes.

Skin Deep Is 2025's Best Cat Game,"My favorite moment in Skin Deep, an immersive sim and stealth game about rescuing cats and fighting your evil clone in deep space, was always the one immediately after a thoroughly developed plan inevitably went sideways. The skittish way that I was forced to sprint and crawl under a table or into a vent. The manner in which my strategy devolved into simply batting things off of shelves in order to incapacitate a roaming guard or noisily distract them from looking in my direction. The way that I leapt onto a guard's back, dug my claws in, and careened them into surfaces in order to knock them out. If you were to close your eyes, I'd argue you could almost hear that distinctive, feline yowl mid-action. In short, I think Skin Deep best captures the experience of being a cat, even if Nina Pasadena, the game's protagonist, is decidedly not one. And for this tremendous feat, I am rewarding it with the honor of being the best cat game of 2025. Long live Skin Deep. In a typical Skin Deep mission, I often tried to keep to the shadows, as is the norm for a game in its genre. I would relegate myself to the ventilation, the pipework surrounding it, and the undersides of tables. Like Batman, I skulked around the perimeter looking for a precise opening that'd enable me to punch a hole in the level's defenses while keeping my cover. Of course, in Skin Deep, it almost never worked out in my favor. Because I am not, in fact, Batman. I'm just a (cat) girl. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
PlayStation Plus Free Games For January 2026 Revealed,"PlayStation has revealed this month's batch of free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers. All PS Plus members will be able to claim Need For Speed Unbound , Epic Mickey: Rebrushed , and Core Keeper starting January 6 and they will remain available until Monday, February 2. NFS Unbound promo art. The most recent Need for Speed game, NFS Unbound, has single-player and multiplayer campaigns set in Lakeshore City, which greatly resembles Chicago. Street racing is a key part of the experience, but so is outrunning the cops. As your ""Heat"" index rises after each race, the police will pursue players with greater intensity as they establish their rep outside of the law. Between races, players can customize their rides and compete in weekly qualifiers to get into the ultimate street racing contest: The Grand. Mickey unleashes his paint brush in promo art for Epic Mickey: Rebrushed. Epic Mickey was a Wii exclusive upon its 2010 debut until THQ Nordic's 2024 remaster, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, brought the game to modern consoles. The visuals and gameplay have been noticeably improved as Mickey Mouse is sucked into the Wasteland where forgotten characters and concepts have languished for decades. This game is one of the reasons why Disney made a deal to gain the rights to Walt Disney's previous creation, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. And for the first time, Mickey has to come face-to-face with his brother, Oswald, and reconcile with him if he wants any chance of escaping the Wasteland. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"This Game With Rocket Trucks, Yakuza, And Sentient Mascots Is 2025's Most Radically Kind And Empathetic Game","Throughout the events of Promise Mascot Agency, I was Pinky's ride. Anywhere that she needed to go, I had to ferry her in my crappy little truck. As a matter of fact, I was responsible for the transport of any and every mascot that stumbled through the doors of the Promise Mascot Agency and came under my employ. When Kofun needed to go to a nearby graveyard, I was the guy for the job. When Trororo needed a lift to the local adult store, I begrudgingly told him to hop in. Be it by land, air, or sea, it became my responsibility, and mine alone, to make sure everyone got where they needed to go. Promise Mascot Agency is a game filled to the brim with chores and mundane tasks like this. As I traveled across the isle of Kaso-Machi, drifting in and out of decrepit villages and farm fields, I found that Promise Mascot Agency's cast was filled with folks in need of some assistance. The English teacher who worked unpaid overtime shifts to put on a night school at her underfunded workplace. The nearby mechanic with an insatiable curiosity for the occult, and no time between his job and family. If a shrine needed to be swept, I was there with a broom in a split second. Whether it was the local barkeep in a gimp suit, the streamer-turned-farmer, or of course, the disenfranchised youth, I was there with an olive branch to extend. Promise Mascot Agency probably sounds like a convoluted game. It is. In one breath, it is a title about an ex-yakuza--handsomely voiced by the same actor behind Kiryu in the Yakuza games--driving around a countryside, rounding up seemingly endless collectibles and upgrades, and sending living mascots (like a giant crying tofu block) out on jobs via a simplistic management system and card-based minigame. In the latter, you must play support cards with differing strengths and weaknesses as a mascot performs a job in order to beat a troubling interference that arises and assure the job is a success. In another breath, it is a full-throated exercise in the lengths of compassion and empathy. It is rarely sleek and sexy about it--Promise Mascot Agency doesn't feature over-the-top set pieces or hide slick new super moves to reward the player for completing its long list of chores. But real, tender empathy for your fellow man rarely does look so good, and Promise Mascot Agency's unglamorous honesty is something I've come to admire from one of 2025's best and brightest games.

Silent Hill F Has One of Horror's Most Gnarly And Profound Transformations,"What do you think of when you think of a woman in pain? There are no tidy universalisms here, but for many of us, even most of us, pain is private and domestic. You could think of a mother shouldering burdens alone while her husband is at work. The father in the waiting room while the mother screams with strangers. A woman going to the doctor about an ache, only for him to tell her to lose weight and deny the problem is even happening. All these things are simple clichés--tropes stolen from life and television. When Silent Hill f conjures a woman's private pain, it is with cutting specificity. In one of the most grisly moments of body horror in video games this year (or ever, really), protagonist Hinako turns into an emblem of her own sorrow, her own compliance, her own screaming rage. Spoilers follow. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
How Love And Deepspace Became A Viral Phenomenon In 2025,"In the cavernous convention halls of Gamescom 2025, conference attendees gawk at towering installations of fabricated castle sets and pirate ships. The massive movie set-esque booths inspire awe, but off center and to the side of these constructions rests another installation--one that has managed to draw an equally impressive crowd without a flashy monument. Wrapped around this booth are chattering fans--many who appear to be women and femmes in their 20s and 30s--all queued in a line long enough to wrap around a city block. They'll remain this way for the better part of an hour, a singular goal making this endeavor worth the wait: taking a photo with a cutout of their favorite man from Love and Deepspace. Developed by Papergames, a China-based studio known for its work on the Nikki franchise, Love and Deepspace is a narrative-focused mobile game in which players romance and bond with a cast of five men. Since its release in January of 2024--and in the past year especially--Love and Deepspace has inspired a fervor comparable to those around the most beloved boy bands. It won Best Mobile Game Award at Gamescom 2025 and surpassed $750 million in gross player spending within two years of release. Yet Love and Deepspace is more than any individual statistic or accolade. It is an absolute phenomenon--one that has also inspired a fandom characterized not just by its sheer size, but by the dedication of its fans. If you have been curious about the game,or rather what makes it so special, here is everything you need to know about the viral sensation, Love and Deepspace. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

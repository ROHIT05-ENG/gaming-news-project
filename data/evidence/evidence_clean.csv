"""What would I change if we could go back?"" Inside Blizzard's big plan to put Overwatch back on top","Overwatch 2 had a problem. It's a problem a lot of live service games have, to be fair. It wasn't particularly exciting any more. It had a chance at launch a few years ago to excite people, to create a wave of momentum to surf thereafter, but it floundered, beset as it was with identity problems and a misguided obsession with PvE, which sounded lovely on paper but never really worked in practice. Plenty of good work was done since on the game but most people outside of Overwatch 2 don't care - or don't know, because they're not looking anymore. They've moved on, they're playing other things. Incremental updates weren't enough to turn their heads. As far as many people were concerned, Overwatch 2 was yesterday's news, been and gone. How, then, does Blizzard make people care again?

Nioh 3 review,"The Nioh series isn't exactly known for its nuance: there is good and evil, strong and weak, and little in-between. From feuding clans to the machinations of political elites, this binary is at the heart of everything in Team Ninja's pseudo-historical canon. Nioh 3 takes this black-and-white worldview and applies it to the feuding Tokugawa brothers at the start of the Seventeenth Century. Your character, Takechiyo, is good: noble, just, proper . Your brother, a bitter little rat tempted by ancient powers beyond his understanding (of course), is evil. His desire for power and notoriety is so distinct, in fact, that it has somehow summoned a supernatural 'crucible' from the darkest reaches of space-time, and this consuming chaos is so profound, it has managed to seep into four major eras of Japanese history. Uh oh! Read more"

There's plenty more to say on Highguard specifically now it's out, but its arrival this week got us talking about the live service curse - the intense skepticism and innate ill-will that seems to accompany every announcement of a new contender, even before they've had a chance to prove themselves. So this week's Big Question for us and then you - are we being too hard on live-service games? Read more"

However, some of Bethesda's other games will not be getting true physical releases on Switch 2. And yes, the game is on Game Card. #IndianaJones https://t.co/jJ0cTDKLLL — Bethesda (@bethesda) February 5, 2026 It sounds like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was a tight fit for Switch 2's cartridges, because certain things like the Polish-language version will need to be downloaded separately. Players who preorder the Switch 2 version will get The Last Crusade pack, which includes Indy's Traveling Suit outfit and his lion tamer whip, as seen in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.

Microsoft Aiming To Launch Four Big Games This Year While Avoiding GTA VI - Report,"Xbox is gearing up for a busy 2026, as a new report states Gears of War: E-Day is planned for a fall launch--as is Fable --with both games trying to avoid Grand Theft Auto VI . The Verge reports that there is a concerted effort within Microsoft to release its ""four horseman"" within 2026, with each one representing a franchise that has been a driving force for the Xbox brand in the past. While a recent Xbox Developer Direct provided new looks at Forza Horizon 6 and Fable, Microsoft has yet to showcase Gears of War: E-Day meaningfully since its reveal in June 2024. Currently, Forza Horizon 6 is expected to release in May, while Fable has been given a Fall release window later into 2026. The report states that Microsoft is aiming to have Gears of War: E-Day launch in the same fall timeframe, while Halo: Campaign Evolved, which will bring the shooter franchise to PlayStation for the first time, is being prepared for a summer launch. Microsoft is reportedly aiming to avoid Grand Theft Auto VI's release in November as much as possible, which could affect the exact release dates for both Gears of War and Fable.

"Ghost Of Yotei Outperforms Ghost Of Tsushima, Sony Confirms","Sony has announced that the open-world samurai adventure sequel Ghost of Yotei has outsold Ghost of Tsushima during the comparable launch period and ""significantly"" contributed to the company's latest financial results. The company didn't provide an updated sales figure for Sucker Punch Productions' latest action-adventure game, but during an earnings call that was transcribed by VGC , Sony confirmed that Ghost of Yotei has ""exceeded the sales of the previous title in the same period of time."" In its first three days, Tsushima sold over 2.4 million units . About four months after its July 2020 release on PlayStation 4, Tsushima then went on to surpass 5 million sales , making it one of PlayStation's fastest-selling new IPs in a while. By comparison, Yotei sold 3.3 million copies one month after its October 2025 release on PlayStation 5. If Sony is saying that the sequel ""exceeded"" the sales of the original game in the same time period, then it's safe to assume that Yotei has dashed past Tsushima's 5 million-sales milestone. It remains to be confirmed if Yotei will reach the same sales figure as Tsushima, which has surpassed 8 million copies as of January 2022 . Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Resident Evil Gets Amiibos For The First Time In Franchise History,"Today's Nintendo Direct included announcements tied not only to the next mainline Resident Evil game, but also new accessories.

Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Preorders Are Finally Live,"Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream $60 | Releases April 16 Preorder at Amazon Preorder at GameStop Preorder at Target After more than a decade, Tomodachi Life is finally getting a sequel. Revealed last year, Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream is officially heading to Nintendo Switch on April 16. The quirky sim has you creating an assortment of Miis, before setting them loose on an island you've handcrafted. You'll then get to watch as their lives unfold, becoming friends, falling in love, and getting into all sorts of other hijinks. It's shaping up to be a wildly popular game--and preorders are now open if you know you'll be playing it later this year. Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream $60 | Releases April 16 This is the only version of Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream up for preorder. It gets you the base game and nothing more, with no exclusive preorder bonuses up for grabs. Oddly enough, Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream has only been announced for Nintendo Switch, and it's unclear if a Switch 2 version is in the works. However, this version should work perfectly on the latest Nintendo hardware, though you won't see any enhancements typically found in Switch 2 upgrades (such as improved visuals or expanded content). If a Switch 2 version is announced, there will likely be an affordable upgrade option for existing Switch owners. In other words, there's no harm in picking up this Switch version instead of waiting around for a Switch 2 version. Preorder at Amazon Preorder at GameStop Preorder at Target Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream is essentially a gigantic life simulator. You'll be able to create a variety of Miis, customizing almost every aspect of their physical appearance. Once you're happy with how they look, you'll set them loose on a massive island of your creation. Along with being responsible for their living space, you can provide input on what they should be doing — and who they should be hanging out with. Over time, your tiny citizens will develop relationships, explore the island, and have all sorts of hilarious interactions. It's shaping up to be a fun cozy game, with low stakes and plenty of secrets to discover. If you're looking for a game that lets you flex your creative chops without demanding gameplay, Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream is certainly worth a closer look. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Nvidia Delays Gaming Chip Amid Memory Chip Shortages,"The ongoing memory chip shortage issues are impacting Nvidia's production now, with the company reportedly planning to delay its new gaming GPU cards this year. According to The Information (via Sherwood News ), Nvidia is pushing the release of its new graphics cards this year to meet the demands for AI processors.

"Steam Machine Should Play Most Games ""Great"" At 4K / 60fps","Valve clearly feels confident in the power of the upcoming Steam Machine . The company has revealed that in testing for the system, ""the majority of Steam titles play great at 4K 60fps with FSR,"" per a new blog post about Steam hardware . For those unfamiliar with FSR, the acronym stands for FidelityFX Super Resolution and in the most basic sense helps upscale image quality. Of course, ""most"" games doesn't mean ""all."" As such, Valve adds there will be Steam Machine games that ""require more upscaling than others, and it may be preferable to play at a lower frame rate with VRR to maintain a 1080p internal resolution."" No specific games are mentioned, and there's no way to predict how future titles may perform on the Steam Machine. The company is currently focused on HDMI VRR (variable refresh rate, which helps to smooth out performance), upscaling improvements, and ""optimizing ray-tracing performance in the driver"" for the Steam Machine. When Steam Machine actually becomes available to buy is still up in the air. In the same blog post, Valve stated that Steam Machine pricing and release details have been delayed because of memory and storage shortages. The company originally planned to already reveal those details to the public. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Starfield May Arrive On PlayStation 5 With Two Versions - Report,"There have been rumors about Starfield coming to PlayStation 5 for some time now, but Bethesda has yet to confirm any of them. Now, a leaker has put forth a report that Starfield will finally get its PS5 port near the beginning of April with two versions of the game. According to Polish site PPE.pl (via Video Games Chronicle ), a leaker who goes by Graczdari has stated that Starfield will hit PS5 on April 7 with standard and deluxe editions. Graczdari has previously leaked correct information about The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered 's physical release, as well as ports for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds and Microsoft Flight Simulator on Switch 2 and PS5, respectively. Considering the flow of formerly exclusive Xbox games that arrived on PS5 in 2025, it was surprising that Starfield wasn't among them. It's been rumored that Microsoft and Bethesda held off until an additional story DLC was ready to be released on Xbox Series X|S and PC as well. Some of Starfield's new features were recently disclosed during a closed-door preview . However, Bethesda has yet to officially disclose its plans for either a PS5 port or the next DLC release.

The Mermaid's Curse is set to release for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on February 19. In addition to a new cast of characters, The Mermaid's Curse trades in The Seven Mysteries of Honjo's rural setting for something more tropical. Paranormasight's core gameplay, however, seems entirely intact, as once again you'll be tasked with investigating grisly murders, confronting supernatural forces, and exploring numerous branching paths as you try to make sense of what's happening to the island and its residents. Though this premise is fun enough in itself, what truly set The Seven Mysteries of Honjo apart was Square Enix's commitment to the game's psychological-horror elements. Similar to Metal Gear Solid, the game features multiple puzzles that extended beyond the boundaries of the game and require abstract thinking. For this reason--and quite a few others, such as its sprawling narrative and manga-inspired art style--the game received extremely positive reviews, yet never achieved true commercial success. With that in mind, it feels a bit surprising we're getting a follow up, so I'm begging you all not to sleep on this one, okay? Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"Penises set Dispatch apart, and I mean that quite sincerely","I think a lot of Dispatch can be distilled into a single moment at the beginning of the game when the player comes face to face with a penis. There it is, dangling visibly between the legs of an unclothed, toxic-drenched super-villain you're about to fight. The camera all but centers on it. There's no way you can miss it unless you've flipped the nudity switch off, in which case it's replaced by an even more conspicuous black box that only amplifies the naughtiness of the part hidden within. But most people don't turn nudity off because they're expecting boobs. That's what we usually see. In Dispatch, however, it's a penis we see waggling unavoidably on our screens. Read more"

Raw power went aside with the Wii, but the company's dedication to tinkering around the edges to create stand-out original experiences in other ways remained - or perhaps even intensified. There's been a lot of examples over the years, of course, from clever game design innovations to zany peripherals - but Donkey Kong Bananza has to be one of the finest showcases of that thinking from Nintendo in years.

"Divinity Team Says Character Creation Will Be ""Even Better"" Than Baldur’s Gate 3","Baldur's Gate 3 was the kind of game that could take hours to get started, thanks in part to a rich character customization suite that allowed players to fine-tune everything from their race to several minute details. For the upcoming Divinity , developer Larian Studios says that players can expect ""even better"" options for fine-tuning their character when the game eventually launches. ""We are planning to have an even better one! More colors, more options, more control,"" Divinity art director Alena Dubrovina wrote in a Reddit AMA session . That's a high bar for the studio to set, considering just how detailed the Baldur's Gate 3 character customization system is. Beyond the standard options, players can also tinker with unique biological traits depending on the race they choose, fiddle around with facial features, and much more. Just when you think you've got your character nailed down, the game also offers you a chance to design a Spirit Guardian for your adventurer, a character who will appear in your dreams.

Palworld Is Making A Play For The Trading Card Crowd Later This Year,"Palworld: Official Card Game, a brand-new trading card game based on Pocketpair's creature-collecting game, has been revealed by Bushiroad and developer Pocketpair. While details are light for now, the game already has a launch date penciled in for July 30. Bushiroad describes Palworld: Official Card Game as a two-player competitive card game where players can ""enjoy strategic and tactical battles"" by deploying unique Pals to the battlefield. ""Players fight alongside their Pal companions, gathering resources, and building bases as they aim for victory,"" the description reads. Each Pal also has unique traits, and cleverly utilizing them can open up a path to victory. Rumblings of a Palworld trading card game kicked off last year after Pocketpair and Animate subsidiary COS purchased shares in Japanese card game publisher Bushiroad. Bushiroad Corporation's CEO and president, Takaaki Kidani, sold his shares to the company (via Automaton ). This followed Pocketpair's formation of Palworld Entertainment, a new company arm dedicated to maximizing Palworld's merchandising opportunities. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Download The Hytale Launcher Now, As Hypixel Estimates ""Over 1 Million"" Players At Launch","Hytale has been on quite a development journey. After being acquired and subsequently shuttered by Riot Games, the original development team bought the Minecraft rival back and recommenced development in November 2025. On January 13, the title goes into early access, which the team acknowledges will be unpolished and full of bugs. Still, Hypixel--the developer behind one of the most popular Minecraft servers of all time--is expecting mammoth launch-day numbers, estimating ""over 1 million"" players. To that end, the studio is encouraging users to download the game's launcher ahead of time in order. Hypixel's CEO, Simon Collins-Laflamme, posted on X stating, ""We expect over 1 million players on the early access release day for Hytale ... Please download the launcher today and log in now to help us significantly reduce launch-day stress."" Hypixel's preorders have been open since early December, so the team has had around a month to gauge interest, meaning this player estimate is based on those figures and not just speculation. Hypixel has already allowed mod creators early access to the game so they can research and develop the best Hytale mods for the early access release. Modders are adding new game modes, cosmetics, items, and quality-of-life improvements to the game, with more being added daily. When the game launches tomorrow, January 13, all of those mods will be available via Curseforge thanks to an agreement between the modding platform and Hypixel Studios. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Diablo 4 Leaderboards Are Coming,"Leaderboards have previously been a part of the Diablo franchise, and starting today, they're back. Blizzard is releasing a new Diablo 4 update across all platforms that reintroduces leaderboards as well as the multi-level dungeons known as The Tower. Blizzard's official site states that The Tower and the leaderboards are both in beta, with more refinements to come in future seasons. The leaderboards will be divided by the seven playable classes--Paladin, Rogue, Druid, Barbarian, Sorcerer, Necromancer, and Spiritborn. Additionally, the leaderboard rankings will only be set for two weeks periods rather than the entire season. Essentially, everyone gets a chance for a fresh start while Blizzard works out any kinks in the system. The leaderboard's rankings are directly linked to The Tower as players' scores are tabulated based on their performance when fighting monsters and bosses. Experienced players with refined character builds should be right at home in the chaos. For less experienced players, The Tower provides enhanced damage levels when players destroy the numerous pylons in the complex. That may not be the equal of having incredibly powerful characters, but it means that players of all skill levels are far from helpless against the onslaught of creatures coming for them in The Tower.

Nintendo's Switch Game Voucher Program Will End Permanently This Month,"Nintendo is discontinuing the sale of Switch Game Vouchers, a program that allowed Nintendo Switch Online members to get a discount on first-party Switch games by purchasing two game vouchers for $100. While existing vouchers will remain valid, no new vouchers will be sold after January 30, 2026. With precious few discounts available for first-party Switch games, Nintendo's game vouchers allowed players to save a little cash by purchasing two vouchers for $100, saving $10 per game as long as both were $60 titles. While the program had a few caveats, including a one-year expiry and the requirement of an active Nintendo Switch Online membership, it offered a reliable discount on first-party games. If you want to take advantage of this discount one last time, game vouchers will still be sold until January 30, and will stay valid for one year after the date of purchase. You can also check the expiry date on any unused vouchers through the Nintendo Switch Online section of your Nintendo account. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Baldur's Gate 3 Won't Be Coming To Switch 2,"In October 2025, rumors suggested that Larian Studios' hit RPG Baldur's Gate 3 could be getting a port for Nintendo's Switch 2 . Unfortunately, that report has turned out to be inaccurate as Larian has confirmed that its wildly popular D&D will not be coming to Nintendo's console. During a recent AMA session on Reddit , Baldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke acknowledged that the company wanted to work on a Switch 2 port, but it was denied. ""We would have loved to [bring Baldur's Gate 3 to Switch 2], but [it] wasn't our decision to make,"" wrote Vincke. That likely means the port was either shot down by Nintendo or by Hasbro/Wizards of the Coast, which controls the rights for all things Dungeons & Dragons-related. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Disney Pixar Luxo Jr. Lego Set On Sale For The First Time At Amazon,"Lego Ideas: Disney Pixar Luxo Jr. (613 Pieces) $63 (was $70) See at Amazon Pixar fans can save 10% on Lego's 613-piece model of Luxo Jr. and the Pixar Ball. Normally $70, Lego Ideas: Disney Pixar Luxo Jr. is on sale for $63. Lego's recreation of the iconic Pixar mascot launched last June and has rarely budged from its MSRP. The current discount is the best we've seen for the set, but it's not marked as an official deal. Over the past few weeks, Luxo Jr.'s price on Amazon has sometimes changed multiple times in a single day, so we wouldn't be surprised if the the price has changed again by the time you read this story. Lego Ideas: Disney Pixar Luxo Jr. (613 Pieces) $63 (was $70) The 613-piece replica of Luxo Jr. measures 5.5 x 4 x 11 inches--though Luxo Jr.'s height varies based on how you pose it. Luxo Jr. can stand next to the buildable Pixar Ball or balance on top of it by making a couple of simple adjustments. Lego designed Luxo Jr. as a fully articulated model capable of being displayed in poses from the iconic Pixar production logo and short film starring the semi-anthropomorphic lamp. The light bulb doesn't actually work, but Lego did a good job of making it look realistic. As a Lego model, Luxo Jr. is quite different than the vast majority of Disney Pixar building sets. Designed for experienced builders and collectors, the model has an interesting build process thanks to its multi-hinged arm, modifiable base, and the many Easter Eggs Lego worked into the authentic recreation. There are dozens of references to Pixar movies hidden throughout the Luxo Jr. and Pixar Ball builds. For instance, the Pizza Planet truck from the first Toy Story movie is included inside the light bulb. The lamp's base has a miniature build referencing Marlin & Dory from Finding Nemo as well as clever allusions to Inside Out, Cars, Coco, WALL-E, A Bug's Life--and possibly others that we missed. The instruction booklet calls out the Finding Nemo character builds as well as the mini-builds found in the Pixar Ball. The interior of the colorful ball features multiple characters from five different Pixar movies: Toy Story - Woody & Buzz Up - Carl & Russell Monsters, Inc. - Mike & Sully The Incredibles family Ratatouille - Linguini & Remy As mentioned, one of the display modes is Luxo Jr. ""deflating"" the toy ball, just like in the production logo's animation sequence. Once you remove two of the rounded plates from the ball, Luxo Jr. can connect to the top. It's a quick and easy modification. The Pixar Ball has its own buildable stand, so the model still feels stable with Luxo Jr. on the ball. See at Amazon Lego Ideas: Disney Pixar Luxo Jr. (21357) Luxo Jr. was the star of Pixar's first short film in 1986. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short, but most Pixar fans were introduced to the character when it hopped across the screen to complete the Pixar logo at the beginning of Toy Story in 1995. The short film originally only played at film festivals and conventions, but it eventually played in theaters worldwide before screenings of Toy Story 2 in 1999. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
1408 Amazon-Exclusive 4K Steelbook Edition Releases This Week,"1408 Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray) $40 | Amazon Exclusive | Releases January 13 See at Amazon Another Stephen King adaptation lands on 4K Blu-ray for the first time this week. 1408, the 2007 psychological horror movie starring John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson, releases January 13 exclusively at Amazon for $40. 1408 Limited Edition Steelbook is a three-disc set with theatrical and extended cuts of the hit film. The collectible steelbook case and slipcover have awesome original artwork; it's honestly one of the best-designed 4K Blu-ray editions of a Stephen King movie you can buy today. Based on a 1999 short story by Stephen King, 1408 follows Mike Enslin, a grief-stricken author who investigates and writes places that are allegedly haunted. His latest investigation brings him to room 1408 at the NYC hotel The Dolphin. 1408 was a pretty big hit at the box office and features terrific performances by Cusack and Jackson. 1408 Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray) $40 | Amazon Exclusive | Releases January 13 The Amazon-exclusive Limited Edition Steelbook is a three-disc set with two 4K Blu-rays and one 1080p Blu-ray. Fans can watch the original theatrical edition on 4K as well as the Director's Cut on 4K and 1080p. The Director's Cut (112m) is approximately eight minutes longer than the theatrical release (104m). The upscaled 4K Blu-ray editions support Dolby Vision and HDR10. Audio formats include Dolby Atmos and Dolby TrueHD 5.1/7.1 surround sound. The two Director's Cut discs have the special features from previous Blu-ray editions, including the three alternate endings. The theatrical 4K Blu-ray disc also has a brand-new featurette titled Don't Enter 1408. The exclusive steelbook case features new artwork by graphic designer Gary Pullin (Ghoulish Gary). The front of the case is a rendering of the door to the eponymous hotel room, while the back features protagonist Mike Enslin's daughter Katie with manuscript pages floating around her and the name of the hotel (The Dolphin). The interior artwork recreates the memorable scene inside the torn apart hotel room where Mike sinks to his knees and reaches out toward Katie. The slipcover features a stylized and modified version of the original promotional image featuring Cusack and Jackson. The new artwork looks fantastic, and it'd be great to see more limited-edition steelbooks opt for a more creative design like Lionsgate has here. 1408 Amazon Exclusive Edition Features: Exclusive steelbook case Exclusive slipcover 2 Cuts / 3 Discs Theatrical (4K) Director's (4K & 1080p) Upscaled 4K (2160p) HDR: Dolby Vision / HDR10 Audio: Dolby Atmos / Dolby TrueHD 5.1/7.1 Special Features: Don't Enter 1408 featurette (New) Audio commentary with director Mikael Håfström and writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski Alternate endings Deleted scenes with optional commentary The Secrets of 1408 (22 minutes) Behind-the-scenes look at the making of 1408.

Lego Lord Of The Rings Book Nook Gets First Discount At Amazon,"Lego Icons: Lord of the Rings - Balrog Book Nook (1,201 Pieces) $111 (was $130) See at Amazon Lord of the Rings fans can save on Lego's Balrog Book Nook for the first time at Amazon. Released last June, the 1,201-piece Lord of the Rings building set is on sale for $111 (was $130). When we first published this deal on Friday, the price was $117--a 10% discount--but now you can save 15%. Deals on Lord of the Rings Lego models are exceedingly rare, so it's cool to see this awesome and practical model on sale for a great price. The LOTR Book Nook can wedge between your various collectible editions of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit to add a fun flourish to your Tolkien shelf. Or you can open the Book Nook and display the buildable Balrog figure alongside your other Lego sets. Lego Icons: Lord of the Rings - Balrog Book Nook (1,201 Pieces) $111 (was $130) Lego picked a rather fitting scene from The Lord of the Rings for the brick-built Book Nook. The 1,201 piece model is based on Gandalf the Grey's battle with Durin's Bane in the movie adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring. Once fully built, the frame resembles the stone pillars and archways of the First and Second Halls in the Mines of Moria. The buildable stand for the Gandalf the Grey minifigure represents the narrowest point on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm. With the Book Nook closed, as shown above, the model is 5.5 x 6.5 x 9 inches and captures the moment Gandalf confidently blocks the Balrog's path and exclaims, ""You shall not pass!"" The memorable line of dialogue is quoted on the Book Nook's front plaque. Lego Gandalf wields his signature staff in one hand and Glamdring (his sword) in the other. The buildable Balrog figure is essentially an articulated action figure, because you can pose his wings, arms, hands, legs, and fingers. Balrog comes with a whip accessory, and flame elements attach to his back. Lego used flexible sheets of translucent plastic to make the wings. It's only been included with one other Lego set: the 269-piece Fell Beast, which was a purchase bonus Lego Insiders when the massive Barad-dûr building set launched in 2024. You can disconnect the bridge from each side to open the Book Nook. This alternate display mode showcases the Balrog's imposing presence with its wings fully unfurled. Flame elements decorate the left and right archways, which is a reference to the Balrog of Moria's ability to start a fire by flapping its wings. With the Book Nook fully unfolded, the wider model is 17.5 x 6.5 x 9 inches. Since neither the Balrog figure or Gandalf minifigure need to be connected to the frame, you can display them without the Lego Book Nook, too. See at Amazon Lego Icons: The Lord of the Rings - Balrog Book Nook (10367) The Movies of Middle-earth Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and more on 4K Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD See at Amazon Lego launched two other buildable book nooks the same day as the Barlog model: Harry Potter and Sherlock Holmes. The 832-piece Hogwarts Express Book Nook retails for $100 and has yet to receive a price cut. The 1,359-piece Sherlock Holmes Book Nook is $130 and is only sold at Barnes & Noble and the Lego Store. Fans of Wicked should also check out the 1,327-piece Glinda & Elphaba Bookends , which are exclusive to Target and the Lego Store, and priced at $130. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Normally $33, the collectible 4K Blu-ray edition is on sale for only $20.49.

"RAM Shortages May Lead To More Expensive TVs And Devices, Warns Samsung","The increasing demand for AI among tech companies is one of the reasons why the global shortage of memory chips remains an ongoing issue.

Once you arrive at one of these POIs, loot every container there until you or another player finds that location's code, then move to the next POI. Do your best to work together with other players in the lobby to prevent unnecessary overlap--meaning that if you see someone else, always ask if they've found one of the codes, or offer to split up and find codes at different POIs to keep things moving efficiently.

How To Open Security Breach Lockers In Arc Raiders,"Arc Raiders is all about looting and shooting your way through a map and hoping to make it back home safely to Speranza. Every moment counts, and every container in the game could end up having that item that makes all the stress of the run worth it. So, it makes sense you may be disappointed to come across a Security Breach locker you can't open. Anything at all could be in there just waiting for you to take it home, right? Well, you might need to put in some time to make it happen, but here's how you can get to opening Security Breach lockers in Arc Raiders.

"Sims Team Says ""Values Are Unchanged"" Ahead Of Potential Saudi EA Deal","Electronic Arts' $55 billion deal to sell itself to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and the private equity firm Silver Lake still has to receive regulatory approval before it's finalized. However, some Sims fans and creators have been concerned about how Saudi Arabi's potential control over the company will affect the inclusive nature of the experience. To alleviate those concerns, the developers behind The Sims franchise wants players to know their core values haven't been changed by this deal. ""The values of The Sims are unchanged,"" reads the statement on the franchise's official page . ""Our Sims team's creative control, guided by our values of inclusivity, choice, creativity, community, and play, has not changed. These values inspire the decisions we make each and every day as we plan for today, tomorrow, and the future."" Given Saudi Arabi's history of human rights abuses, the worried reactions from The Sims community appear to be understandable. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren have both raised their concerns about ""foreign influence"" on EA if the deal goes through. Subsequently, EA has asserted that it will retain creative control of the company following the sale. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"This AI VTuber Just Beat A Huge Twitch Record, But It's Not Who You're Expecting","Sometimes, I feel like writing the same article four times could be considered a bit of a meme. But then I remember that this is a pretty phenomenal achievement for any streamer, let alone an AI VTuber. First Neuro-sama beat the Twitch Hype Train world record ... then it happened again . And again . This time around, her ""sister"" Evil Neuro, who has her own distinctive voice, model, and attitude, led the calls to beat the Hype Train record for a fourth time. In the process, she also helped her creator Vedal987 become the third-most-subscribed Twitch channel of all time. After becoming the third most-subscribed channel, Vedal joined Evil on stream to ask his community to ""Give it a rest."" He added, ""In all seriousness chat, you have given me and the twins more than we need, so it's okay."" Evil wasn't happy with this though, retorting, ""No Vedal! Please can we raise the timer, just a little bit? Don't you think it's a bit cruel to just cut it off here?"" Evil was referring to the timer that's currently running for Neuro's third birthday subathon, where each subscription gifted to the channel adds time to a countdown clock that determines when the stream will end. It has been running since December 19, 2025, and has around 22 hours left at the time of writing. Regardless, shortly afterwards the Hype Train did come to an end at level 72--although not a fourth world record, it's still a hugely impressive achievement, and leaves Vedal's Twitch channel with more than 328,900 subscribers. It's hard to nail down an exact figure, since that number continues to rise as the community attempts to extend the subathon. What that does mean, however, is that Vedal, Neuro, and Evil have overtaken streamer Jasontheween and fellow VTuber Ironmouse 's positions as the third and fourth most-subscribed channels on Twitch . The only two channels that have ever beaten that achievement are Evelone2004 , with 459,924 subscribers, and KaiCenat with 1,112,947 subscribers. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Fortnite X South Park Quests: How To Ride 5 Rides At Cartmanland And Complete Every Quest,"During Fortnite Chapter 6, most every cosmetic you could unlock from a pass or for free was earned simply by gaining XP in any mode. But Epic has returned to the old ways in Chapter 7, with unlockable cosmetics that require completing specific quests. Case in point is the Born in Chaos mini pass for Fortnite's new South Park crossover , which comes with a series of quests that you'll need to complete in order to unlock the otherwise-free cosmetics. That means that if you want to get those Terrance and Phillip doll pickaxes, you'll actually need to pay attention to these quests. Some of them you'll certainly complete by accident if you play Fortnite regularly, but others will require a bit of conscious effort. And we'll make it just a smidge easier by handling the thinking part for you--which is to say that we'll explain each quest in detail below. All of these quests must be completed in Battle Royale or Zero Build, and they provide pass progress only. The quests themselves don't offer XP directly, but there are three level skips you can unlock as you progress the event pass, and you can already earn one of them (worth 80,000 XP) by completing five quests. Completing four quests from a batch will award a Memberberry--collecting six Memberberries awards the Imaginationland Airship glider. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Manor Lords Publisher Has Banned AI Assets In Its Games, Calls Them ""Cancerous""","The publisher behind strategy games Endless Legend 2, Terra Invicta, and Against the Storm has officially banned the use of AI-generated assets in all its products. Hooded Horse has had a significant presence in the strategy game space over the last few years, thanks to hits like Manor Lords. Now, when many publishers and developers are evaluating (or touting) their relationship to generative AI, Hooded Horse is rebuking its use for art generation. Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender discussed the ban in an interview with Kotaku , emphasizing that restrictions on AI art are part of every contract Hooded Horse signs. He said, ""It is now written into our contracts if we’re publishing the game, 'no f**king AI assets.'"" He also expressed personal exasperation with how GenAI has made his job harder. He said, ""If I sound frustrated, it’s because, like, honestly, all this thing has done is made our lives more difficult."" This frustration comes from the fact that GenAI usage can be difficult to catch. Even if the intention is to use a generated asset only as a placeholder, those assets can easily make their way to the final product. ""We’ve gotten to the point where we also talk to developers and we recommend they don’t use any gen AI anywhere in the process,"" Bender elaborated. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Divinity Will Have Co-Op At Launch,"You will be able to play Divinity with your friends and family. Developer Larian Studios has confirmed co-op will be included for the RPG when it comes out, whenever that may be. During a Reddit AMA , Larian technical director Bert van Semmertier gave the thumbs-up to co-op in Divinity, stating that the feature ""will be available for release."" What's intriguing, however, was how the developer discussed how many people might be able to team up in the game. ""The amount of players playing together will be depending on the final party size,"" van Semmertier responded. ""But since modding is planned for this project as well, player[s] will be essentially free to extend this. There is no hard limit to the amount of co-op players."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"The Division 3 Is Gearing Up ""To Be A Monster,"" Says Series Executive Producer","Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment seem to be feeling pretty good about the development of Tom Clancy's The Division 3. Julian Gerighty, who oversees the franchise as executive producer, says the game is ""shaping up to be a monster."" In an interview at the New Game+ Showcase (via VGC ), Gerighty opened up just a bit about the next major installment in the online action-RPG series. ""The Division 3 is in production, right? This is not a secret; it's been announced,"" Gerighty said. ""It’s shaping up to be a monster."" In 2023, Ubisoft officially announced that The Division 3 was in development , so of course Gerighty is correct that it's not a confidential matter at this point. ""Within these walls at Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will have as big an impact as Division 1 was,"" Gerighty added. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Fortnite Now Lets Creators Publish Islands With In-Game Transactions,"Epic Games may have opened a can of worms by fully enabling developers in Fortnite Creative to implement in-game purchases into their experiences. Developer tools for in-game transactions were available in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) in a preview state since November, letting creators charge V-Bucks for digital items in their unpublished Fortnite Creative modes and games, or ""islands."" Epic Games has just flipped the switch, allowing for these islands to be published. The implementation of these developer tools for monetization in Fortnite Creative has raised complaints and worries, with players comparing this development to Roblox's revenue model. Concerns about pay-to-win practices and predatory microtransactions have emerged in Fortnite communities since Epic Games first announced its plans to implement this approach.

"Lawsuit Alleges Fortnite, Roblox Structurally Changed A Child’s Brain","Fortnite and Roblox have been named in a new lawsuit filed in San Francisco by a Louisiana mother who's alleging her child may have experienced structural brain changes due to prolonged exposure to online games. Descheca Jackson claims in the lawsuit brought to the US District Court for the Northern District of California on December 30 that her child, a minor only identified by the initials ""MA,"" has developed symptoms consistent with internet gaming disorder (IGD) since playing video games at a young age. This includes behavioral challenges such as her loss of impulse control, withdrawal symptoms, irritability, anxiety, and difficulty disengaging from gameplay. The lawsuit also alleges that MA suffered addiction, social isolation, depression, loss of friends and relationships, and damage to her grades, leading to ""an academic dismissal from school."" According to a February 2025 study reported on by About Lawsuits , IGD is described as a pattern in which gaming negatively impacts a person's daily activities, including school, work, relationships, and family life. The symptoms tend to include nonstop gaming, irritability when access to games is restricted, and continued use despite its negative consequences. The research suggests IGD affects one in 10 adolescent boys, with Minecraft and Roblox often the culprits of the disorder. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Larian Studios Draws Harder Line On AI, Clarifies Stance In Reddit AMA","Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke, as well as creative directors, recently participated in an AMA on Reddit to set expectations for the studio’s upcoming Divinity game , particularly about its stance on generative AI--a hot-button topic in the industry right now. Responding to a fan question about the role of generative AI in game development, Vincke was rather blunt: ""There is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity."" His comments arrive amid wider debate over how and whether AI should be used in creative processes, especially as some high-profile games have faced backlash for such use. One notable example is Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the acclaimed RPG that had two Indie Game Awards (including Game of the Year and Debut Game) rescinded when it was revealed the title had included AI-generated assets during development, violating strict no-AI rules--even though those assets were patched out later. In the AMA, Vincke acknowledged that previous discussions about experimenting with AI tools for concept-art had been confusing . To make its intentions clear, the studio has elected to avoid generative AI entirely in concept-art creation for Divinity. As Vincke put it, there should be no doubt about where the art came from.

Fire Emblem: Path Of Radiance Joins Switch Online’s GameCube Classics Library,"Ahead of the release of Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave later this year, Nintendo has added Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance to the Switch 2's library of GameCube classics. Regarded as one of the best entries in the entire franchise, Path of Radiance will be available for all Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers. First released in 2005, Path of Radiance earned critical acclaim for its dark storyline, mature themes, and for being the first 3D Fire Emblem game. Set on the fictional continent of Tellius, the game follows the mercenary Ike and his companions as they set out to rescue a princess and save the kingdom of Crimea from the invading nation of Daein. Like previous Fire Emblem games, Path of Radiance is a turn-based tactical RPG that features permadeath: Any character who falls in battle is permanently lost for the rest of the game.

Arc Raiders Dev Promises New Anti-Cheating Measures Are Coming Soon,"The extraction shooter Arc Raiders has proven to be one of the top hits of 2025, which has in turn attracted some unscrupulous players who aren't above cheating to win. After the rule-abiding Arc Raiders players became vocal about their displeasure, Embark Studios has announced that new anti-cheat measures are on their way to the game. ""We've seen the discussion around the topic of cheaters in Arc Raiders,"" reads the message shared on Arc Raiders' Discord server via PC Gamer . ""Please know that we are taking this issue very seriously and are listening to, and acting on your feedback. Over the next few weeks, we are implementing significant changes to our rulesets and deploying new detection mechanisms to identify and remove cheaters. This includes updating our Anti-Cheat systems for improved detection and bans, as well as applying client-side fixes specifically addressing the 'out of map glitch.' Furthermore, we are introducing tools for streamers to help mitigate stream sniping."" A firm timetable for the anti-cheat measures wasn't disclosed. However, Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund recently revealed that Arc Raiders has quietly introduced "" aggression-based matchmaking ."" Söderlund went on to clarify that matchmaking is still skill-based, but it will also match players ""based on how likely you are to engage in fights with fellow players.""

PUBG: Blindspot Is Heading To Early Access Next Month,"Nearly a year ago, Krafton launched the beta test for PUBG: Blindspot , the first-ever spin-off from PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (not counting PUBG Mobile). Now, Krafton has announced that Blindspot is getting an early-access release on February 5. This title differs from its predecessor by embracing a top-down perspective and focusing on 5v5 battles in a tactical showdown. Attacking teams are tasked with making their way through a building in order to break into a vault and install a device called the Decrypter. Specific weapons like grenade launchers and explosive hammers can break down the walls standing between the players and their goal. Defending players can set up barricades to slow down their adversaries, but these are battles that ultimately come down to gunplay. The newly released trailer shows off some of the improvements coming to the early-access build, including enhanced visuals and UI, as well as balance adjustments and control refinements. Krafton describes it as a ""launch-ready level of quality"" in support of ongoing development. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
This Star Wars Overhaul Mod Makes Starfield Really Fun To Play,"Starfield has had a somewhat divisive response from players since it debuted in 2023, but there is a Star Wars mod that transforms it into a more rewarding experience. The Star Wars: Genesis mod was released in 2024, but this year, it's adding lightsabers and a more immersive experience for Starfield PC players who want to take the plunge. Star Wars: Genesis was created by a modder who goes by DeityVengy, and it's available for free on Nexus Mods . The mod features an original story that's set between the prequel and original Star Wars trilogies. There is an update coming before the end of January that adds even more content to the mod, and DeityVengy showed off some of those new features in the video below. In the video, DeityVengy notes that using a lightsaber forces players into a first-person perspective because Starfield's melee animations weren't up to the challenge of depicting lightsaber combat. The story featured in this clip also focuses on the player's character confronting one of the Nightsisters of Dathomir before letting them decide whether to spare or slay her.

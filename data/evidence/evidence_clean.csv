"Penises set Dispatch apart, and I mean that quite sincerely","I think a lot of Dispatch can be distilled into a single moment at the beginning of the game when the player comes face to face with a penis.

There's no way you can miss it unless you've flipped the nudity switch off, in which case it's replaced by an even more conspicuous black box that only amplifies the naughtiness of the part hidden within. But most people don't turn nudity off because they're expecting boobs. That's what we usually see. In Dispatch, however, it's a penis we see waggling unavoidably on our screens. Read more"

End-game boss? Spoiled. Every collectible location and what happens after you've collected every magic hat or whatever? Spoiled. Plot twists, because I might as well go all in at this point? Spoiled. If I don't learn it before the game comes out, I'll certainly know about it shortly after release thanks to research. (I learned what happened to Zelda in Tears of the Kingdom via Google Trends. Google bloody Trends .) Read more"
Skin Deep was this year's reminder that it's a privilege to recognise a developer's handwriting,"Out in space there are objects that orbit one another for so long, and at such a stately pace, that when they both eventually arrive at the same point, they don't collide with some kind of awful explosion.

Blades of Fire and Hideo Kojima showed me I can still be surprised by a video game and that originality is essential,"I am pretty confident in my ability to judge video games. I've been playing them (increasingly badly over more recent years!) for almost 40 years and writing about them for over 20, so it's rare that something blindsides me. But that's exactly what happened with Blades of Fire , the action soulslike adventure from Mercury Steam. I loved the studio's Castlevania rethink, Lords of Shadow, but was so-so on its output since, including the Nintendo-published Metroid Dread . My expectations for Blades of Fire were low to moderate. Incredible, then, that I've not played another game released this year that I enjoyed more. Read more"

Someone Dressed Up As Pac-Man To Play Pac-Man During AGDQ Livestream,"Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ), a bi-annual charity livestream, kicked off this week with an assortment of speedrunners playing new and old games, from Jet Set Radio to Wuchang: Fallen Feathers . A wacky event that tends to attract all sorts of characters, someone made a surprise appearance during AGDQ on January 5: Pac-Man, who played Pac-Man World 2 . Well, it wasn't really Pac-Man. The day started with speedruns of games like Final Fantasy X , Mega Man Battle Network , Nuclear Throne , and Wolfenstein: The Old Blood . As the multi-hour livestream went on, the event's organizers booted up Pac-Man World 2 for Minecraft content creator DThaiPome to play. If the event raised $10,000, then Pac-Man--really, DThaiPome in a blow-up Pac-Man costume--would speedrun his own game. That fundraising goal was easily crushed, and DThaiPome, in a Pac-Man outfit, played some Pac-Man. Playing a remastered version of the classic 2002 platformer, DThaiPome managed to beat Pac-Man World 2 in approximately 30 minutes, employing all kinds of skips and tricks to get to the end as quickly as possible.

"Resident Evil 4 Remake Scrapped An Opening Chapter Starring Ashley, Files Show","Resident Evil 4 Remake's opening moments could have played out much differently if Capcom had not opted to cut an opening referred to as ""Chapter 0,"" in which players would have controlled Ashley and witnessed her kidnapping at the hands of the Los Illuminados. At least, that's according to datamined files spotted by an eagle-eyed fan. Using leftover pieces from ""Chapter 0"" found in the game's files, YouTuber Thekempy has pieced together what the game's lost opening might have looked like in a recent video. Players would have controlled Ashley alone in a forest at night as she encountered a Los Illuminados ritual, something which can actually be briefly seen in a story trailer for the game released in October 2022. After witnessing the sacrifice, Ashley would have made her way to the center of the game's village, potentially having to use the light of her phone to navigate and sneak past deadly enemies like the Ganado. Her running would become more frantic as the chapter continued, eventually witnessing a Ganado kidnapping another character, Luis Serra. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Red Dead Redemption 2 Players Have Discovered A Long-Hidden Mystery,"Red Dead Redemption 2 has been out since 2018, but Rockstar Games' blockbuster title apparently still has some secrets hidden away. RDR2 players have uncovered a pattern of web that only shows up on the map at a certain time of day, and the ultimate destination of this mystery hasn't been fully solved yet. The Strange Man YouTube channel (via IGN ) shared the first video guide to the webs, and credited the discovery to three players: goldenplaysterraria, pariah87, and u/FL4VA-01. Like the dreamcatchers quest in the game, players can shoot the webs and get them to release a feather. However, there's only a one-hour window in-game to find a web, and each web only appears at a specific time throughout the in-game night cycle. In a follow-up video, Strange Man reveals the location of a ninth web in the middle of the spider puzzle, which leads to a telephone pole and more clues. The search is currently centered on a guitar symbol, and players are combing over Fort Wallace, since it's the closest location with guitars to the newly discovered symbol.

Not only that, but a new record for actively gaming users was also set, with that figure reaching almost 13.4 million as compared to March's 13.2 million record. The timing of the record is likely no coincidence. Steam's annual Winter Sale , which wraps up later today, offered steep discounts on a wide range of popular titles, along with more modest deals on newer releases. Sales events have long been a reliable driver of traffic on Steam, pulling in both longtime users and players returning to pick up games they missed throughout the year. Steam's growth has been steady for well over a decade, but it has accelerated sharply in recent years. A notable spike occurred in early 2020, when COVID-19 lockdowns pushed concurrent users past 23 million, later climbing to 28 million just a couple of years later . The company even offered a bundle of games, which went to COVID relief at the time . Since then, the rise of live-service games and consistently strong seasonal sales have helped keep players logged in, especially during holidays. Games like Arc Riders continue to grow, hitting over 3 million concurrent players this week . Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Rainbow Six Siege Players Hit With 67-Day Ban After Another Apparent Hack,"Following a hack that happened over the Christmas weekend, Rainbow Six Siege players are finding themselves in the ban house thanks to yet another hack that references the nonsensical and popular 6-7 meme. According to The Gamer , Ubisoft's tactical shooter is being hacked by some unknown force that's handing out bans for 67 days. Players are reportedly posting on social media that their accounts have been flagged for an unexplained "" harassment offence ,"" leading to their accounts being suspended from matchmaking. Content creator VarsityGaming, who's been memeing the hack since it happened on January 4, corroborated the 67-day ban on their social media, suggesting that Siege may be down for two more days.

The Last Of Us Star Discusses Neil Druckmann's Exit From The Show,"The Last of Us Season 3 is on the way, but Neil Druckmann--who helped created the game's universe that the HBO show adapts--is not going to be part of it. He dropped out after Season 2, saying he wanted to focus on his work at Naughty Dog. Bella Ramsey, who plays Ellie on the show, has shared more insight into the series going ahead without one of its key creatives. Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter , Ramsey said that while Druckmann has exited the hit HBO show, he's not really gone because his world will live on. ""I think he left us in such good stead. And he still will always be a part of the fabric of it--it's literally his creation; the whole world. He's still there, even though he is not. So I think it will be fine,"" Ramsey said.

"Arc Raiders Continues To Be A Huge Hit, Reportedly Achieving These New Records","Arc Raiders was a breakout hit in 2025, and it's still growing. New data from Alinea Analytics states that the game enjoyed its biggest day ever on Sunday, January 4, when it came to daily active users. It was reported to have had 3.2 million daily active users on January 4 across platforms. Additionally, the research group said Arc Raiders passed 12 million copies sold over the weekend. The number of Arc Raiders copies sold daily began to ""stabilize"" in early December, but the recent 20%- off sale--which brought the price down to $32--along with a boost related to people being off from school and work for the holidays, helped pump up daily sales figures, the report said.

Arc Raiders Dev Defends Use Of AI Yet Again,"Arc Raiders was one of the most successful games of 2025, but it was also criticized for its use of AI-based text-to-speech systems . Patrick Söderlund, the head of Arc Raiders studio Embark, has now shed more light on the situation, saying the studio's goal in implementing AI into its development processes is to make better games more efficiently. He also pushed back against the idea that using AI systems in game development would lead to lower employment at Embark. ""We don't use AI to not have to hire people or replace people or job groups or voice actors,"" Söderlund told GamesBeat . ""People have to take a step back and understand what it is and how it can be a big help to developers and be a tremendous benefit to players. I realize it is an intricate subject and discussion.""

Arc Raiders Player Screaming For Help Gets Frantic Visit From Real-Life Neighbor,"Sometimes you get so into a game that you scream uncontrollably. Whether that be a curse word or an SOS, if you yell loud enough, someone will come to your rescue. At least that's what happened to one Arc Raiders player, whose door was kicked in by a concerned neighbor after he heard the player yelling for help. Redditor dreamthorp posted a 16-second clip of the incident on the Arc Raiders subreddit on January 3. They said they were playing a night raid on the Dam Battlegrounds, the game's very first map. While trying to extract from an elevator, a Leaper reportedly pounced on and downed them before the elevator doors shut. ""I just wanted to get stabilized so I could leave,"" dreamthorp said in the comments of their Reddit post. It's at this point that they started screaming, ""Somebody help me."" Well, somebody did come to help. As displayed on the door's Ring camera, a concerned neighbor walked over, knocked, and asked if they were ""all good."" Dreamthorp screamed for help again, at which point the concerned neighbor--a firefighter, according to dreamthorp--stepped back, assumed a stance, and kicked the door in, an action that allegedly corrupted the Ring camera's file.

"It's The Final Countdown For Anthem, With Only One Week Left To Play","Time is running out to play Anthem, BioWare's live-service game that originally launched in early 2019. In just one week, EA will take the online-multiplayer game offline, meaning it won't be playable starting January 12. EA officially announced that Anthem would be shut down in July 2025. This gave players roughly half-a-year to return to the RPG and to spend any leftover currency they had for the title. Eurogamer is looking at whether any sort of in-game event is planned to make the occasion, but that seems very unlikely at this point. After that announcement, former BioWare producer Mark Darrah discussed what went wrong with Anthem --at least from his point of view. For instance, Darrah noted that Mass Effect director Casey Hudson pitched Anthem to EA as a whole new direction for BioWare, but then Hudson left the studio and couldn't lead that proposed transformation. Hudson is now overseeing the team that's working on the recently revealed Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic . Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Code Vein II Tells A Time-Traveling Story That Will Tug On Your Heartstrings,"The souls-like genre has exploded in popularity since the dawn of From Software's Souls franchise, with multiple companies taking a stab at the format--and some companies taking multiple stabs. Bandai Namco, who publishes FromSoft's Souls games as well as Elden Ring, dropped an anime-style version of the genre in 2019's Code Vein, and now it's back for more in Code Vein II. We spent a few hours with the next Code Vein adventure during The Game Awards week, and we came away impressed with its improved combat system and a new and interesting take on the genre's ""summon"" mechanic, but what surprised us most was an original story that carries some emotional weight. The original Code Vein was a solid first effort, but Code Vein II shows that the franchise may have, pardon the pun, cracked the code. Code Vein II A new code Code Vein II takes place in a world on the edge of ruin, and where humans and Revenants, a human-like species of beings with vampiric abilities, live amongst one another. Our demo picks up in the present, as the effects of the Resurgence--a cataclysmic event that slowly morphs Revenants into mindless beasts--are wreaking havoc on the world.

Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora Got A Major Player-Count Boost After Fire And Ash,"Over two years after its release, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is enjoying an all-time peak on Steam, likely in large part due to the game's new DLC that ties in directly to the film franchise's latest installment. Data from SteamDB showed that the Ubisoft-published open-world game hit a record number of 15,283 players this week--a gain from its previous peak of 12,496 players last month when Avatar: Fire and Ash hit cinemas on December 19. With the release of the movie came a DLC expansion for Frontiers of Pandora on the same day --titled From the Ashes, the story expansion takes place weeks after the events of Fire and Ash and is thematically linked to the film. The DLC costs $25, though a From the Ashes edition of the game that includes the base game retails for $40. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Would You Like To Play More Saw Video Games? Lionsgate Wants You To,"Fans have had over 20 years of the Saw franchise, and John Wick is already celebrating over 10 years, with a fifth installment possibly on the way. Saw has become a contemporary iconic horror series that has spun off into a slew of merchandise, had its own Halloween Horror Nights house, and even a video game back in 2009 and its sequel. While Wick doesn't have the level of crossover appeal--though both Wick and Jigsaw's puppet have appeared in Fortnite --Lionsgate is looking to take both Jigsaw and Wick into video games for a new generation. On a recent earnings call, Lionsgate chairman Adam Fogelson mentioned that there is ""increased interest and increased opportunity"" to make new AAA games based on Lionsgate IPs. Fogelson specifically mentioned Wick and Saw. ""Our AAA game opportunities and other gaming opportunities around John Wick and Saw and some others that we'll be announcing soon, we're seeing increased interest and increased opportunity, and we remain on schedule,"" he said (via Seeking Alpha ). ""So I think in totality, you are going to see a meaningfully additive financial opportunity coming in the coming years."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Dev Doesn't Just Want To Be People-Pleaser With Next Game,"To say Sandfall Interactive has gained a few fans after releasing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 would be a wild understatement. In fact, the RPG wasn't just GameSpot's Game of the Year , but also made history at The Game Awards . This all means expectations will be sky high for the developer's next project. However, Sandfall wants to avoid appealing to the masses and continue focusing on ""what we think is cool."" Speaking with Edge magazine , Sandfall lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen noted that ""it's always in the back of my mind that we have a lot of fans now, and they have certain expectations and certain feelings toward the game."" The goal for the team is to avoid that noise. ""Creatively, we've always let our North Star be our own personal taste in terms of what we think is cool--what it is we enjoy and want to see. I've seen too many TV shows and books be swayed trying to please a lot of people, and in the process you end up losing the heart of what's there,"" Svedberg-Yen said. ""So [we] feel like we need to trust our instincts and continue to trust the vision behind the studio."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"The Last Of Us Season 3 Loses Another Person, Role To Be Recast","The upcoming third season of HBO's The Last of Us will feature a different actor playing Manny .

007 First Light Has Been Delayed,"Through most of last year, IO Interactive assured players that its upcoming James Bond title, 007 First Light , was set for an early 2026 debut. The game had been scheduled to debut on March 27, but the release date has now been pushed back to May 27. In a statement posted online late last month, IO Interactive's Hakan Abrak called 007 First Light the company's ""most ambitious project to date"" while mentioning the Bond staples included in the game like car chases, gadgets, and wild globe-trotting adventure. However, he went on to say that the decision to delay it ""allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve on day one."" ""The game is progressing well and is fully playable from beginning to end,"" added Abrak. ""So these two additional months will allow us to further polish and refine the experience, ensuring we deliver the strongest possible version at launch. We're confident this sets 007 First Light up for long-term success, and we sincerely appreciate the patience and continued support we've received ever since we first announced the game.""

8BitDo 64 Retro Gray Bluetooth Controller Preorders Restocked At Amazon,"8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller (N64 Gray) $45 | Releases January 30 Preorder at Amazon The upcoming gray edition of 8BitDo's great modernized Nintendo 64 controller is back in stock at Amazon for $45. Scheduled to launch January 30 , the new edition matches the color scheme of the N64 controller that debuted with the console back in 1996. The 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller originally launched last August for $40 with two color options: solid black and solid white . Nostalgia will cost you an extra five bucks, but the gray edition looks very good. The 8BitDo 64 Controller works wirelessly on Analogue 3D, Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, PC, Apple devices, and Android. The controller's reimagined form factor and layout was designed in partnership with retro hardware manufacturer Analogue. The 8BitDo 64 is the official controller for the Analogue 3D , the superb FPGA console that plays Nintendo 64 cartridges in 4K resolution. After multiple delays, the Analogue 3D launched in November. If you're interested in picking one up, the white and black editions of the Analogue 3D are back in stock for $270 on Analogue's online storefront. Note: The console does not come with a controller, and the 8BitDo 64 is currently the only officially supported wireless option for the Analogue 3D. 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller (N64 Gray) $45 | Releases January 30 The colors on the gray edition of the 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller look virtually identical to the original Nintendo 64 controller. The shell's distinct shade of classic Nintendo gray is complemented by colorful buttons. Here's the list of inputs on the 8BitDo 64 Controller: Hall Effect Control Stick (Light Gray) D-pad (Dark Gray) A button (Blue) B button (Green) C-pad (Yellow) Start button (Red) L/R shoulder buttons (Dark Gray) L/R Z triggers (Dark Gray) Select / Star / Home (Light Gray) A switch on the back of the controller toggles between S-Input for Switch 1/2 and D-Input for everything else, including Analogue 3D. With the 8BitDo Ultimate Software V2 desktop or mobile app, you can fully remap the controls and make other adjustments. The 8BitDo 64 connects wirelessly via Bluetooth LE (Low Energy) or Bluetooth 5.0. The Analogue 3D and some newer Android phones support Bluetooth LE, so battery life is a bit better when gaming on those devices. The 8BitDo 64 can run for up to 36 hours between charges when connected via Bluetooth LE. On Switch 1/2, that number is closer to 30 hours, in our experience, which is still impressive. You can also use the 8BitDo 64 as a wired controller with the detachable USB-C to USB-A charging cable. Instead of the bulky N64 Rumble Pak, the 8BitDo 64 has built-in rumble motors. Vibration only works on Analogue 3D and when playing N64 games in the Nintendo Switch Online app on Switch 1/2. Outside of the color scheme, the new gray model is identical to the white and black editions, so the features outlined below apply to all three colors. Preorder at Amazon 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller $40 The 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller has a contemporary form factor like the manufacturer's Ultimate Controller series and the official Switch 1/2 Pro Controllers . 8BitDo retained the unique aspects of the original joystick while upgrading the tech and ergonomics. The joystick is repositioned to the left side of the controller, and while the cap has the trio of circular ridges, the rubberized texture is much kinder to your thumb than the N64 controller's plastic surface. Just like the original, the 8BitDo 64 has an octagonal stick gate, which Nintendo included to mimic an eight-way D-pad. The stick is activated with a Hall Effect sensor (anti-drift) and has a wear-resistant metal ring. The classic four-way D-pad still sits in a recessed pocket, while the large A/B buttons and C-pad match the original layout. The R/L shoulder buttons are chunkier and offer better feedback. The N64's Z button, which was located on the back of the middle prong, is replaced with two conventional Z triggers behind the shoulder buttons. The dual triggers are helpful if you want to use the controller for games outside of the N64 library. The N64's big Start button returns and is joined by three buttons found on many 8BitDo Switch controllers: Minus (select), 8BitDo (home), and Star/Turbo. With standard turbo activated, your game will register holding a button down as repeated taps. There's also an auto-turbo mode that spams the programmed input without needing to press the button at all. See at Amazon If you have trouble syncing the 8BitDo 64 to Switch 2 or Analogue 3D, make sure the controller is updated to the latest firmware . If you're a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscriber , the 8BitDo 64 has superior ergonomics and is more affordable than the official N64 Controller sold on the Nintendo Store.

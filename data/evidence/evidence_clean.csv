I clearly remember playing the original Tomb Raider games at my friend's house after school on his dad's computer. Now, admittedly, most of the time I was either running away from various creatures while screaming and clenching my buttocks very tightly, or flexing my skills at Croft Manor rather than actually raiding tombs, but the sense of wonder and fun I felt back then has stayed with me all these years later.

Amazon Game Studios Has Lost Its Studio Head,"The head of Amazon Game Studios, Christoph Hartmann, is parting ways with the company amidst layoffs that have cut around 16,000 jobs across Amazon. The move comes as Amazon winds down its gaming ambitions, shifting focus to its cloud gaming service Luna. Hartmann's departure was reported by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier , on the same day as Amazon announced a massive round of layoffs that will impact around 16,000 people company-wide. The move follows a previous round of layoffs last October that cut 14,000 jobs, hitting Amazon Game Studios particularly hard as the company scaled back its AAA development projects. Christoph Hartmann has a long history in the games industry , from working on the original Grand Theft Auto to co-founding 2K Games in the early 2000s, and he was brought on board by Amazon Games in 2018. More recently, Hartmann may be more notorious for saying that AI wouldn't take jobs in games as they ""don't really have acting."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Xbox Gaming Revenue Declines As Console Sales Continue To Slump,"Microsoft has posted its earnings results for the latest quarter and while it's been a strong period for the company as a whole, the Xbox gaming division is struggling. Though Microsoft posted an overall revenue increase of 17% year-on-year, gaming revenue is down 9%--with console sales making up a large part of that decline. Microsoft's Q2 FY26 results generally look great for the tech behemoth, with the company boasting a staggering $81.3 billion revenue largely driven by its cloud and business divisions, but Xbox isn't looking so healthy right now. Microsoft's gaming division revenue declined 9% as a whole, with a 5% decrease in revenue from content and services, which includes Game Pass. Microsoft explains that this decline can be mostly attributed to strong first party content the year prior, and predicts that Q3 will see a similar decline in the single digits for the same reason.

This VTuber Didn't Know She Was Recording Lines For A Super Mario 64 Mod,"If you're familiar with the VTuber world, you'll know Ironmouse 's name. The popular Puerto Rican streamer and singer launched her Twitch channel in 2017, becoming a prominent spokesperson for the Immune Deficiency Foundation due to her own lived experience of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Her immune disorder sees her largely bedridden, and Mouse began streaming just to make friends. She was vastly popular, and in 2024, she became the most-subscribed Twitch streamer of all time. That record has since been regained by Kai Cenat, but she remains a hugely influential figure in the VTubing sphere. One of the friends she made in those initial months was voice actor and fellow streamer Connor Colquhoun, better known as CDawg. The two regularly stream together, with Connor virtually taking Ironmouse to real-world locations she can't currently visit. The pair have visited Disney World, Omega Mart in Las Vegas, TeamLab Borderless in Tokyo, Sanrio Puroland, and more. It's no secret that the two are very fond of each other, but Connor's latest surprise for Ironmouse is very cool indeed. Connor arranged for custom models for the best friends. Without telling her, Connor arranged for a special Super Mario 64 mod to be created, adding multiplayer co-op capabilities and custom sprites--created by Violet-Artss --resembling Ironmouse's VTuber model and Connor's own ""monke"" persona. That's very sweet, but what might be even more impressive is that Connor managed to get Ironmouse to record the in-game voice lines without even realizing what she was creating.

Highguard Will Have More Frequent Content Updates Than Apex Legends,"Highguard developer Wildlight features veterans who previously worked on Apex Legends . Since they are intimately familiar with what they believe to be the mistakes of their previous title, Wildlight is determined not to repeat them with Highguard. ""I don't think it's any mystery that we launched Apex Legends and we were not ready,"" recalled design lead Mohammad Alavi during a Highguard press event (via Polygon ). ""But we survived that fire and we learned a lot from it."" The fire Alavi is referring to is that Apex Legends was dropped without a firm plan for post-release content. That game's developer, Respawn Entertainment, eventually set up a timetable for its first year, and Wildlight has already done the same for Highguard . Unlike the earlier game, Highguard's new content will be released more frequently. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Fable 4 Release Date Window, Story, Trailers, And Everything Else We Know","A new mainline Fable game hasn't been seen since 2010, now going on 15 years. The fantasy action-RPG series known for its generous serving of humor and some life-sim elements is finally coming back, though it's already been a few years since this reboot, simply called Fable (or sometimes called Fable 4 by fans) was revealed in 2020. With so many Xbox Game Studios projects in the works, few are as anticipated as this one. Let's take a look at everything we know about Xbox's next Fable game. Table of Contents [ hide ] Fable 4 trailers Fable 4 trailers Our first look at Fable didn't give any story or gameplay details, but it did certainly set a mood. The trailer showed off a fairy flitting her way through an idyllic fantasy forest, before suddenly getting eaten by a huge toad. That fits the irreverent tone the Fable series is known for. And notably, the trailer simply refers to it as ""Fable,"" indicating this could be a reboot. It would be a few years before we saw a new Fable trailer, but we got one--including what seemed like some hints of actual gameplay footage--in June 2023 during the Xbox Games Showcase. Though more than two years later, when this is being written, it would appear the game isn't tracking for a 2025 launch. British actor and comedian Richard Ayoade voices Dave, the oversized gardener who's not too fond of our heroes. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Ubisoft Veteran Says He Was Suspended For Criticizing Its Return-To-Office Policy,"An Assassin's Creed Shadows developer has claimed that Ubisoft suspended him after he spoke out against the company's recent return-to-office policy. Level designer and 13-year veteran of Ubisoft Montreal David Michaud-Cromp made the claim on his LinkedIn page that Ubisoft placed him on a ""three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension,"" which was put to him ""as being related to public comments I expressed regarding the company's return-to-office policy, and based on an alleged breach of the duty of loyalty."" Earlier in January, Ubisoft announced a drastic restructuring of the company including studio closures and game cancellations , as well as likely layoffs in the future. The video game publisher also pushed for a five-day return-to-office workweek. Now, one Ubisoft employee says he's been punished for speaking out against that. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Dune: Awakening Is Getting Big Changes With Chapter 3,"Last year, Dune: Awakening developer Funcom promised fans that its free Chapter 3 update would arrive between January and March 2026 . Now, the official date for Dune: Awakening Chapter 3 has been set for February 3, and it's bringing a lot of requested changes to the game. On Funcom's developer's blog , the team noted that Chapter 3 was designed to address fan demands for more endgame options, additional content for the world of Arrakis, and the ability to experience everything in the endgame without ditching the players' preferred play style. With the arrival of this update, players will be able to progress after reaching the sixth tier, Planstanium, with enhanced Specialization and Augmentation systems, as well as ""deeper choices, shared goals, and more ways for players to continue growing"" in late-game play. There will also be 10 new locations on the Overland Map that have repeatable testing stations and boss encounters. Players can choose to make those boss battles easier or harder, although the latter will earn more rewards than the former. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Dead By Daylight Is Getting A Balatro Crossover Featuring (A) Joker,"In February 2025, Balatro introduced a handful of Dead by Daylight -themed cards for its Friends of Jimbo 4 update.

"Fable Reboot Is ""Just Mind-Blowing,"" Microsoft Boss Says","One of the big reveals from the recent Xbox Developer Direct was the first gameplay showcase for the Fable reboot , and now a top Microsoft boss has further hyped it up. Craig Duncan, the head of Xbox Game Studios, said in an interview that the Fable reboot is coming together well, specifically singling out the game's so-called ""Living Population"" feature as being ""mind-blowing. He said this to GamesRadar amid a response to a question about if he felt it was a ""risk"" for developer Playground to make an RPG after working exclusively on the Forza Horizon series since 2012.

"Switch 2 Could Fail To Sell As Well As OG Switch, Says Analyst","As one analyst predicts that the Nintendo Switch 2 will see a price increase this year, another analyst suggests that the Mario maker's Switch successor may not maintain the same sales figures as its predecessor. IGN reported an in-depth story about the Switch 2's holiday season , speaking to several analysts around the world to understand whether it really had a bad holiday. The short answer? Not really, as declining sales are expected for a console with a somewhat established base. The long answer? Kind of, particularly because the Switch 2 didn't have a big blockbuster exclusive to bolster sales going into the holiday season. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is good-- as evidenced by GameSpot's 8/10 review --but it's not a Mario or a Zelda, so the name cache wasn't there to elicit fervent purchasing during Thanksgiving and Christmas. Ampere Analysis' games industry analyst and researcher, Piers Harding-Rolls, told IGN that it's for this reason--alongside the predictable success of the Switch due to environmental conditions--that the Switch 2 wouldn't sell as well as the Switch did. ""When the original Switch launched, it followed a failing Wii U generation--there was a lot of interest, but hype and momentum built up in the run-up to the holiday sales at the end of 2017,"" Harding-Rolls said. ""This time around at the Switch 2 launch, demand was predictably high because of the success of the Switch. Following a record launch, it's not surprising that Switch 2 sales have not been able to maintain the same massive sales lead [as] the original Switch. For the record, Switch 2 shipments in 2025 should outperform the original Switch in 2017 and over a shorter period of time. Then there is the whole macroeconomic situation, less disposable income, and higher-priced hardware. This may be softening demand to an extent, especially as lots of new games are still available on the original Switch."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Dispatch Has To Cover Up On Nintendo Switch,"Dispatch , one of last year's best games, arrives on Switch consoles this week , bringing its brand of workplace comedy, capes, tights, and censored genitalia to the Nintendo platform. While the PC and PS5 versions of Dispatch don't shy away from showing off superhero anatomy--but do offer a toggle to apply a censorship mosaic to any naughty bits--Nintendo's content guidelines have mandated that this mode must be turned on at all times. There's also no option to turn it off in the Switch edition, so all explicit content has been censored. ""Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually,"" developer AdHoc said to Eurogamer , while also stressing that the game's story and gameplay remain unaffected. ""We worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remain identical to the original release.""

Highguard Store Page Removes Mention Of Apex Legends And Titanfall,"Developer Wildlight has updated the store pages for the newly released free-to-play shooter Highguard to remove mention of how the game was developed in part by people who also worked on Apex Legends and Titanfall.

Capcom Explains How “Hot Uncle” Leon Came To Be In Resident Evil Requiem,"With Resident Evil Requiem launching on February 27 for Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, developer Capcom is revealing more about the game. This includes showcasing series mainstay Leon S. Kennedy, who has become hotter as he's gotten older, and we can thank the company's female staff for that. In an interview with Automaton , director Koshi Nakanishi discussed the ""ikeoji"" phenomenon that emerged after Leon was revealed during The Game Awards on December 11. (""Ikeoji"" roughly translates to ""an attractive or cool older man,"" typically in their late 30s to early 60s.) Nakanishi explained that it took quite a bit of time to perfect Leon's older appearance, with Capcom's female staff contributing a lot of fine details to make sure the zombie-killing badass was as hot as possible. ""We've spent quite a lot of time polishing Leon's visuals,"" Nakanishi said in a joint media interview. ""Leon has many fans among Capcom employees, and women in particular were pretty strict when reviewing his design. They would point out and comment on even the finest details like the wrinkles on his neck. When I mentioned that story in the past, a female fan told me, 'The women developers at Capcom did a really good job.' Throughout the development process, Leon was thoroughly refined, and I think we managed to come through with a design that would make anyone's heart throb."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Scott Pilgrim EX Confirms Two More Characters, Out This March","Scott Pilgrim EX has confirmed its March 3 release date and revealed two new playable characters in its latest trailer. Matthew Patel and Robo-01 are the two new playable characters. If you're familiar with Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, you'll know that Patel was originally the villain of the whole graphic novel. He and his faithful robot are playable here, more so reflecting the uneasy alliance they showed in the Netflix animated series Scott Pilgrim Takes Off. It's the first time either character has been playable in a video game. The press release for this announcement suggests that one more playable character will be revealed before Scott Pilgrim EX comes out in March. It's gratifying to finally have confirmation of a release date for Scott Pilgrim EX too, as it was first announced at Summer Game Fest last year and this March 3 date leaked earlier this week .

Five More Star Wars Lego Smart Play Sets Coming March 1,"Star Wars Lego Smart Play Sets See all at Lego Store Lego revealed five new Star Wars Smart Play sets earlier this week at the Nuremberg Toy Fair, all of which are now up for preorder at the Lego Store. The five new sets include minaturized versions of iconic Star Wars vehicles like the Millennium Falcon ($100), Imperial AT-ST ($50), and Luke's Landspeeder ($40), as well as dioramas based on famous scenes and locations like the Mos Eisley Cantina ($80) and Yoda's Swamp Hut ($70). The sets benefit from the recently announced Smart Play system, which enables additional interactivity to each build when paired with a Smart Brick. However, unlike many of the other Lego Smart Play sets announced so far, these five new releases will not include a Smart Brick in the box--meaning you'll need to pair them with one of the other Star Wars All-In-One Smart Play sets that include the interactive piece to unlock their full functionality. The lineup arrives on March 1, but since we're expecting this debut to be quite popular, it's not a bad idea to reserve your favorites in advance. You can check out full details on all five sets below, along with quick looks at the previously announced Star Wars All-in-One and Pokemon sets that are also available to preorder. Lego Star Wars Smart Play: Millennium Falcon (885 pieces) $100 | Releases March 1 Build the classic Millennium Falcon with this upcoming Lego set. The completed build is around 10.5 inches long and 9 inches wide, and it's packed with four smart minifigures--Han Solo, Chewbacca, Luke Skywalker, and C-3PO. When bundled with a Smart Brick, you'll get to enjoy interactive lights and sounds, including lightsaber clashes and fuel explosions. Without the Smart Brick, you can still make use of two stud shooters and removable top panels that make it easy to access the detailed interior. Preorder at Lego Store Lego Star Wars Smart Play: AT-ST Attack on Endor (347 pieces) $50 | Releases March 1 For a smaller project, the AT-ST is just 347 pieces. It comes with a smart Wicket minifigure, plus traditional minifigures for an AT-ST Driver and Scout Trooper. Interactive features include a dual stud shooter and an opening cockpit that fits one minifigure.

Check Out This Portable PlayStation 4 That You Won't Be Able To Buy,"A modder that goes by Wewillmakeitnow on Reddit has shared footage of a functional and portable PlayStation 4, using parts salvaged from a PlayStation 4 Slim console. The handheld runs PS4 games natively given the hardware it's built around, with the modder cutting down the console's PCB as much as possible to fit within a custom enclosure. That's equipped with a 7-inch OLED display, the ability to connect the device to a TV, and a 130Wh battery that manages anywhere between 90 minutes to three hours of gameplay depending on the game. Credit: Wewillmakeitnow on Reddit Gallery Given the scope of the project and the design around a PCB that was never designed for a portable form factor, the handheld is quite thick and seemingly unwieldly to hold. Wewillmakeitnow states that this was purely an engineering experiment and doesn't plan to make anymore, despite some request from other Reddit users on the thread. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"The ""Survival Of Graphics Card Manufacturers"" Is On The Line, Says GPU Maker Zotac","The ongoing crisis with RAM pricing and the associated knock-on effect it is having on numerous consumer electronics still has its worst days to come, according to GPU manufacturer Zotac. In a message to its Korean customers, translated by X user Harukaze5719 and reported by Tom's Hardware , the company announced that it is suspending its 2% rewards program in the region in a bid to try to sustain GPU pricing for as long as it can, citing growing concerns with escalating prices as an existential threat to the industry as a whole. Citing the same concerns over current memory prices and the increasing costs of silicon, Zotac has warned its customers that stock for many current-generation GPUs might dry up for a long time, with no promise of it regulating in the near future. Zotac is one of a few companies that predominantly manufactures graphics cards and hasn't diversified in other areas of gaming hardware. This puts it at a much bigger risk than other companies, such as Asus and Gigabyte, given the margins on their only products are very quickly being squeezed. This doesn't mean that its warning is any less concerning, especially as it comes a few weeks after Asus suggested that stock of its various 50-series Nvidia GPUs might similarly face supply constraints.

"Ubisoft Unions Call On Workers Strike In February: ""Enough Is Enough!""","Ubisoft workers in France are summoning their collective power to protest the latest restructuring and cost-cutting decisions at the mega publisher, with five unions calling for a ""massive international strike"" in early February. According to a joint statement on Bluesky and reported by Game Developer , five Ubisoft unions--STJV, Solidaires Informatique, CGT, CFE-CGC, and Printemps Ecologique--are proposing that all Ubisoft employees stop working from February 10-12 to combat a ""CEO who doesn’t even dare talking to employees anymore."" This work stoppage is in response to Ubisoft's return-to-office mandate , studio closures and game cancellations in the wake of its major restructuring , workforce-reduction suggestions , and general employee disrespect. ""We are not fooled: Rather than taking responsibility for layoff, they prefer to push us out by making our working conditions unbearable,"" the statement reads. ""It's outrageous. Our colleagues carry on, hold fast, endure, out of solidarity, out of love for the industry, and out of passion. But enough is enough! It is because we love Ubisoft that this situation revolts us!""

Halo MMO Was Trying To Set Itself Apart In This Way,"Years ago, Microsoft and developer Ensemble Studios were working on a Halo MMO project. The game never materialized, though, and now one of its developers, Rob Fermier, has shared some further insight into the game and what it was aspiring to be. Fermier said part of the appeal of making a Halo MMO was that the developers personally enjoyed MMOs in general. ""I still play World of Warcraft to this day, from day one,"" Fermier told PC Gamer . ""And it was a chance for us to bring something more action-oriented."" Fermier went on to say that, from his view, no one has made a true ""action MMO,"" and this was what the Halo project was trying to do. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Emberville Announced For PC, Blends Diablo-Style Action With Stardew Valley Vibes","Emberville , the spooky fusion of Stardew Valley-like farming and Diablo-flavored combat, has an official release date window for its Steam Early Access debut. Out in Q3 2026, the action-adventure RPG will give players an early taste of its atmospheric world and combat, and to celebrate, developer Cygnuss Cross uploaded a trailer that features the voice talents of the Witcher himself, Doug Cockle, and Alex Jordan, who voiced all 11 versions of Jan Dolski in last year's The Alters. In development since 2023, Emberville is primarily focused on customization through its farming, gathering, and crafting gameplay mechanics. Similar to other cozy farming sims--but with a touch of sinister malevolence in the air--players can gather resources and improve the procedurally generated world around them by leveling up, learning skills, and unlocking blueprints.

Assassin's Creed Black Flag Remake Rumors Heat Up With Leaked New Merch,"Assassin's Creed Black Flag took the inner conflict of the Templars to the high seas in the early 1700s during the golden age of piracy. Along with retaining the series' stealth and combat system, gameplay elements focused more on the ship-based exploration on an open-world map. It's long been rumored that it's in line for a remake , and a recently leaked statue could add fuel to that fire. The unreleased statue features Black Flag protagonist Edward Kenway sitting on a treasure chest overflowing with gold coins, leaning back against his ship's wheel, brandishing a cutlass and a pistol. Above Kenway is a waving flag featuring the game's logo: the Assassin's Creed sigil with a skull in the center. Numerous fans spotted the item pop up, including notorious Assassin's Creed leaker j0nathon, who quickly realized this was not a statue that had been publicly released already. Even weirder is how this statue was reportedly listed via the used clothing resale app Vinted. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"PlayStation 6 Is Likely To Launch After 2028, Analyst Predicts","The PlayStation 6 is a much-talked-about machine despite lacking an official announcement from Sony, and a report by an industry analyst suggests that we might not see this new console until after 2028, as Sony is looking to extend the PS5's lifespan. A Japanese-language report from MST International senior analyst David Gibson (per IGN ) looked into Sony's overall performance and potential future. According to Gibson, ""Sony expects the PS5 lifecycle to be longer than that of previous console generations"" and that there is a ""high likelihood that the PS6 launch will occur after 2028."" Recent console cycles have lasted around seven years, with the PS3 launching in 2006 before the PS4's release in 2013; the latter then had the limelight until the PS5 launched near the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. This pattern led to assumptions and predictions that a PS6 would come to markets in 2027, but Gibson believes there are a few reasons not to expect it so soon. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Elder Scrolls 6's Setting Was Agreed On Years Ago, Former Dev Says","The Elder Scrolls VI is one of the gaming industry's most anticipated upcoming titles, and one of the key mysteries about it is where the game may be set. According to Bethesda's former Elder Scrolls loremaster Kurt Kuhlmann, the developer agreed on the setting many years ago, but he is not going to spill on the beans on what it is, and it might have changed anyway. ""From when we were talking about it way back in the Fallout 4 timeframe, there was a sort of consensus amongst a few people that were talking about it,"" Kuhlmann told PC Gamer. He left Bethesda in 2023, and he doesn't know if what the team agreed on is still the chosen setting for The Elder Scrolls VI. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Nintendo Direct Coming Up Next Week, Report Says","The first major Nintendo Direct of 2026 will be held the first week of February, according to a noted insider. Nate The Hate said on his podcast this week, ""From what I have been told, the first Direct of 2026 will be held during the opening week of February.""

"Nex Playground Boss Says The Console Solves The Wii ""Problem""","While Sony and Nintendo have expanded their lead over Xbox, a dark horse console had a very strong showing in third place in November. The Nex Playground has emerged as a breakout hit, and CEO David Lee believes that one of the reasons why its been so successful is because the console has solved the Wii ""problem."" Nearly two decades ago, the Wii powered Nintendo's post-GameCube comeback with its motion controls and unique games. Lee argues that the scope of Wii's success made it difficult to sustain in the long term. Instead of trying to sell games like Wii, Nex Playground is offering its titles as part of a subscription service. ""One of the most important things we should do is learn from history and try not to commit the same limitations, and that's why we have a subscription model,"" Lee told The Game Business . ""Nintendo expanded the audience with Wii. When you expand the audience, and they want different things, and they only buy Wii Fit, Wii Sports and not many others … that's a bit of a problem.""

Save Up To 25% On The Akira Manga Hardcover Edition,"Akira Hardcover Collection Save Up To 25% See all volumes at Amazon Any list gathering up the best that anime has to offer will inevitably include Akira, and for good reason. The 1988 movie raised the bar for film animation and is widely credited with introducing mainstream audiences outside Japan to the medium. However, the anime adaptation is only part of the tale. Like innumerable other anime projects, Akira is adapted from a much longer--though lesser-known--manga series. While the Akira manga has been available in print for decades, a new Akira Hardcover Edition kicked off earlier in 2025, offering the most authentic presentation of Katsuhiro Otomo's groundbreaking sci-fi saga. If you've ever wanted to experience the full Akira saga, this is one of the best ways to do so--and as luck would have it, you can save a few dollars on these premium hardcover releases. Four volumes in the six-volume series are available to purchase at Amazon , and while these normally cost between $30 and $40, you can get them for up 25% off. Volumes 5 and 6 are also launching in the coming weeks , and preorders are live. Akira Hardcover Collection Save Up To 25% The Akira Hardcover books published by Kodansha use the updated translation and lettering of the 35th Anniversary Edition box set, and each book is presented as a large-sized 7"" x 10"" collectible. Like traditional manga, they are read from right to left, and the original Japanese-language hand-drawn sound effects from the manga have been restored. Each hardcover book has cover artwork based on the original manga tankabon volume artwork. As mentioned above, four volumes have launched so far, and are currently discounted to roughly $26 - $27 at Amazon (normally $30 - $35 each). The next release, Akira Hardcover Collection 5, releases on December 23. Preorders are discounted to $34 (down from $36).

All six volumes come bundled together with the hardcover Akira Club art book and an exclusive pill patch. It's currently sold out, but it gets restocked periodically at Amazon, so it's worth checking back to see if it's available. Set in a dark future timeline, Akira first began publication in 1982 and ran for 120 chapters. Taking place in the post-apocalyptic city of Neo-Tokyo, the series examines the after-effects of a mysterious explosion that almost destroyed the city. Thirty years later, teenage biker gang leader Shotaro Kaneda finds himself in the middle of a plot that involves militant revolutionaries, psychically gifted individuals, military forces, and his childhood friend, Tetsuo Shima, who has begun to develop dangerously destructive psychic powers of his own. Akira manga was critically acclaimed for its mature themes, well-developed characters, intriguing storylines, and Otomo's artwork. In the years since its publication, it's become regarded as one of the pioneering works in the then-burgeoning Cyberpunk sci-fi subgenre. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Amazon Lightning Deal: Donkey Kong Bananza Amiibo Gets Big Price Cut,"Donkey Kong and Pauline Amiibo $20 (was $30) Get deal at Amazon Donkey Kong fans can grab the Donkey Kong Bananza Amiibo for $20 (was $30) at Amazon right now. This is a Lightning Deal with limited quantities. At the time of writing, over 20% of the available Donkey Kong and Pauline Amiibo figures have been claimed. Amazon also has deals on two Amiibo figures that launched alongside the Nintendo Switch 2: Yunobo from The Legend of Zelda and Jamie from Street Fighter 6 are available for $8 each. Meanwhile, GameStop has all seven Switch 2 Amiibo launch figures for $6 each. The Legend of Zelda: Yunobo Amiibo -- $8 ( $30 ) Street Fighter 6: Jamie Amiibo -- $8 ( $40 ) Donkey Kong Bananza: Donkey Kong and Pauline -- $20 ( $30 ) Donkey Kong and Pauline Amiibo $20 (was $30) Based on DK's wide smile, we imagine he's punching his way to a Banandium Gem. He's also moving fast because Pauline's legs are dangling in the air. The uneven ground beneath DK's feet aligns with rocky terrain found in Ingot Isle, Lagoon Layer, and other locales from the game. As for its functionality in the game, scanning the Donkey Kong and Pauline Amiibo grants two main perks. You can unlock Pauline's Diva Dress a lot earlier in your adventure with the Amiibo. The Diva Dress doubles the likelihood of enemies dropping music discs. To unlock the Diva Dress, you need to talk to the NPC shaped like the Amiibo in the Resort Layer. The NPC will ask you to show them the Amiibo to claim your reward. Without the Amiibo, this particular outfit is locked behind post-game challenges. Scanning the Bananza Amiibo also spawns gold KONG letters that can be smashed to refill Bananergy. KONG tiles can also be spawned by scanning older Donkey Kong Amiibo figures.

According to Windows Central , Bethesda ""felt more comfortable"" about pushing Starfield's second DLC to the first half of 2026 because Microsoft already had a ""busy holiday period"" for 2025 without it. More intriguingly, the same report indicates that Bethesda has already been showing off the new update and DLC behind closed doors to a select group of players. One of the rumored changes is a revamp of the game's space flight systems that will actually make travel feel like a journey instead of a series of loading screens. Other aspects of space travel and exploration are also said to be improved in the new update, and the Creation Engine will reportedly include ""large technical improvements ... that will also carry forward to future games.""

"Witcher 4 Dev Is Says AI Can Unlock ""Meaningful"" Benefits","The Witcher and Cyberpunk developer CD Projekt Red is the latest company to sound off on the use of AI in gaming.

The company is already implementing such technologies ""mainly in the productivity areas"" and so far that's where the ""largest benefits"" have stemmed from, he explained , as reported by GamesRadar. A developer won't be able to use AI to make an entire game, though, and humans will remain essential to the process, he said. ""The benefits are real, they’re meaningful; but it's not a situation--and I'm unaware of such a situation--where AI could 'sit down and make games.' That's our take.

Fortnite Responds To The Grinch Hating On The Game,"Christmas is around the corner and one of Universal Studios' biggest attractions is the meet-and-greet with The Grinch. Meeting Whoville's Christmas curmudgeon can take up to over five hours with the lines, but with social interactions going viral, it's hard not to resist a photo and a few minutes with the beloved monster. The interactions are fairly quick; you can maybe get a quick question in, and then the photo, and be on your way. Fortnite creative developer Immature asked Mr. Grinch if he played Fortnite . Innocent enough, but in the typical Grinch way, he turned sour on the game, saying it got boring and needed him to be in it. ""I used to, but then it got boring. Very boring. But I know they're always releasing new skins and characters. I heard that [Marty] McFly guy is in there now. I heard Eminem was in there--there's a bunch of new things. When are they going to put me in there? If I was in the game, it would be fantastic, but since I'm not..."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"Switch 2 Game Ditches Game-Key Cards For A Physical Release, But It'll Cost More","Game-Key Cards have been divisive since they were first introduced, but the good news is that the full R-Type Dimensions 3 game will be on the Switch 2 cartridge. The bad news? You're going to have to pay a little bit extra for that side-scrolling shoot-'em-up, as the price is going up to €70. It's worth noting that those who already preordered the physical Special Edition will not see their price change. Publisher Inin Games had previously explained that switching the entire run to standard cartridges would have resulted in manufacturing costs increasing by ""at least"" €15 per game copy, which is why it chose the Game-Key Card option. Inin Games pledged to look for a way to release the full game on a Switch cartridge, leading to today's news about the costs increasing, but not as much as it anticipated.

However, this a limitation to what players can do with their Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment systems. Sony and Honda aren't including in-car consoles, and they are relying on PlayStation Remote Play for this to work.

There Is No Xbox Wrapped This Year -- Here’s Why It Might Not Be Happening,"It's almost the end of 2025, and in the spirit of Spotify Wrapped, several big companies have invited subscribers to review their last year of activity. Sony got the ball rolling with the PlayStation Wrap-Up , Steam offers a similar annual roundup, and the Nintendo Switch Year in Review recap has been announced for early next year--but where is Xbox in the middle of all this? While it doesn't offer an Xbox wrap-up every year, it still feels odd for Microsoft's gaming brand to skip 2025. The year has seen several high-profile releases from the company and the launch of an Xbox-branded handheld gaming PC alongside Asus, but according to Windows Central , Microsoft is allocating its marketing budget toward celebrating several major anniversaries in 2026. The Xbox brand celebrates its 25th anniversary next year, Blizzard has its 35th anniversary to look forward to, and Bethesda is turning 40. Those are several significant milestones in proximity to each other, and it's a safe bet that Microsoft wants to accommodate them, possibly explaining the lack of an Xbox Wrapped this year. On top of that, we'll see the return of BlizzCon in September , and Blizzard has teased its "" biggest year yet "" for 2026. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Video Game Concept Artists Say GenAI Isn't Making Things Easier,"Generative AI has been at the forefront of the conversation for the past few years, with companies becoming divisive on how to implement it, if at all. Larian CEO Swen Vincke recently kicked a hornet's nest after saying the studios' developers use generative AI tools for things like exploring new game ideas, developing concept art, creating placeholder text, and for PowerPoint presentations . After a quick retraction and explanation , along with sharing that the studio was in fact growing its pool of artists rather than shrinking. Vincke has admitted that Larian uses AI for tasks nobody wants to do, but does AI--even at the concept art stage--help actual concept artists? According to a handful of video game concept artists, it can actually make things harder. Talking to Edmond Tran from This Week In Video Games , artists said that it complicates their workflow and doesn't help them creatively. ""I'm seeing more and more clients generate something approximating their desired outcome and essentially asking me to make 'something like this,'"" said Paul Scott Canavan, an artist who has worked as an art director and concept artist for projects like Destiny 2, Heroes of the Storm, Guild Wars 2, and Netflix's The Witcher. ""It sucks. This practice absolutely invalidates the entire creative process, in my opinion, and makes my job harder and more frustrating. The job of an illustrator or concept artist is to draw from their years of experience to interpret a brief in a creative way."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"

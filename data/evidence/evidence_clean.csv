Brendan Fraser's Comeback Era Includes Getting Wrecked In The Legend Of Zelda,"After years out of the Hollywood spotlight, The Mummy and The Whale actor Brendan Fraser has made a huge comeback. The actor has new film roles lined up, but right now, his most pressing concern is avoiding getting steamrolled by the notorious Lynel mini-bosses in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. In an interview, Fraser was asked whether he was playing any video games, and he explained that he was ""still stuck"" on the critically acclaimed 2017 Zelda game. ""I want to know how to get better weapons without getting my ass kicked by all the Lynels,"" Fraser said to IGN , while also lamenting that there simply aren't enough bomb-flowers in the game. While his interviewer suggested he consult online guides, Fraser responded that he was looking to beat the game the old-fashioned way, without relying on walkthroughs. The next film that Fraser will appear in, Pressure, will see him portray Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower, one of the key leaders of the Allied forces during World War 2 and the 34th US President who served from 1953-61. The actor also announced last year that he would reprise his role as Rick O'Connell in the fourth Mummy movie. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Marvel Rivals Developer Is Preparing To Crack Down On This New Exploit,"Marvel Rivals introduced an upgrade to its hero proficiency system last week, allowing players to earn new rewards. Many of these rewards--including the brag-worthy Lord icons--require a considerable amount of grinding to achieve, which has led to the rise of ""Lord farming"" amongst the playerbase. Essentially, players aren't moving after they spawn into a match, as they spam their abilities to earn proficiency points safely. This has led to some very one-sided matches, and developer NetEase says it'll address this problem in a future update. There's no date yet for when this update will go live, but players can expect some severe penalties if they're caught farming stats this way. ""Recently, we've noticed that some players are exploiting matches by remaining stationary and repeatedly farming stats to gain hero proficiency points,"" NetEase wrote online . ""This behavior disrupts normal gameplay and seriously affects the match experience of other players. To address this, we are planning to introduce a combat behavior detection system. Players found engaging in such behavior may face penalties including, but not limited to: warnings, short-term suspensions, long-term suspensions, or permanent account bans. We ask all players to help us maintain a fair and healthy game environment."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Valve Updates AI Disclosure Guidelines To Allow For AI-Powered Tools,"Valve has made changes to its AI-disclosure guidelines, removing the need for studios to disclose whether or not games have been developed with AI-powered tools and putting more emphasis on AI-generated assets. The change, which was pointed out by Simon Carless on LinkedIn , suggests that Valve is no longer concerned by the use of AI tools that assist development, stating, ""Efficiency gains through the use of [AI-powered dev tools] is not the focus of this section."" These tools could included a variety of things, such as AI-generated transcripts of meetings to code helpers that have become prevalent in most programming environments. Valve states the the aim of its disclosure policy is to inform players when AI is used to generate content, from marketing and conceptual assets to in-game ones that players will interact with. Developers are able to specify what assets have been generated and indicate, via a single checkbox, whether or not players will interact with AI-generated content during gameplay, be it images, audio, or other content.

"Marvel's Wolverine - Gameplay, Release Date, And Everything We Know","Over the last couple of years, developer Insomniac Games has earned critical acclaim for its work on Marvel's Spider-Man series. Following two main Spider-Man games and the Miles Morales game, the studio's next project is one that has Marvel fans excited as a legendary mutant is stepping back into the spotlight. The last time that Wolverine had a solo game was all the way back in 2009 with X-Men Origins: Wolverine. A tie-in game to the film of the same name, Raven Software's single-player adventure was a gruesome and action-packed spectacle of blood, guts, and adamantium claws. More than a decade later, Insomniac's take on the X-Man is looking like a spiritual successor, and you won't have to wait too much longer to play it as it'll be out later this year. Table of Contents [ hide ] When will Marvel's Wolverine be released? When will Marvel's Wolverine be released? As revealed during the September 2025 State of Play, Marvel's Wolverine will be popping its claws in Fall 2026.

Satisfactory Multiplayer: The Basics For Peer-to-Peer And Dedicated Server Hosting,"Factory production lines in Satisfactory will grow to immense sizes the longer you play, and it can be hard to manage. A good friend, though, will cut that work in half. Satisfactory offers both peer-to-peer multiplayer and server-based multiplayer, and each of them has their disadvantages. We'll talk about how to get each of them going here. There are three ways to host games in Satisfactory: Peer-to-peer games, self-hosted servers and rented servers. Peer-to-peer and self-hosted server options are both free, while a rented server option will have a monthly cost associated with it. Meanwhile, peer-to-peer is the easiest to set up, followed by rented servers, and finally self-hosted servers. Peer-to-peer A peer-to-peer session has to be initiated by whoever has the save game you're playing in. Sessions can be private, meaning that you'll need an in-game invite to join, or set to Friends Only, meaning that anyone on your friend list can hop in via Satisfactory's Join Game menu. Each game has a Session ID. If you share this with someone, they can join a Friends Only game regardless of whether they're on your friends list. Each time you initiate a session, though, the Session ID will be reset. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
How to Use Satisfactory's Smart Splitters,"Once you make it past the early game in Satisfactory , your production lines will skyrocket in complexity. As the number of items you're producing goes from a dozen to dozens , so will the number of conveyor belts carting all of that around. Mastering Smart Splitters will be a crucial part of advancing in Satisfactory, keeping your production lines navigable and easy to understand. What is a Smart Splitter? The function of a regular splitter is fairly obvious--it splits a single conveyor belt into as many as three belts. That's great for a smelter cranking out more ingots than any single production line needs, such as having one smelter sending ingots to make plates, rods, and screws. There's no configuration needed here, either. It's just plug-and-play. So what makes a Smart Splitter smart? Smart Splitters are programmable, allowing you to determine which items on a belt go where. There are programmable splitters, too, that do the same thing but at a higher level, allowing you to sort more than three different outputs. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Battlefield 6 Update Improves Jet Combat And Knife Attacks,"Earlier this week, Battlefield 6 's Season 2 launch was pushed back to February 17 to give the development team more time to implement some needed changes. But that doesn't mean there won't be some improvements ahead of time. Electronic Arts has announced that Battlefield 6 Update 1.1.3.5 will arrive on Tuesday, January 20, and it's bringing some good news for anyone who wanted the jet combat to be more refined. Going forward, jet cannon damage against flying vehicles has been greatly reduced, and it will take ""approximately 40% more hits"" to blow targets out of the sky. However, the air radar that was previously announced will not be included in this update. Melee combat was also a priority for this update, which aims to improve ""responsiveness, consistency, and sprint behavior for melee attacks, including knives and the sledgehammer."" The Assault Ladder should also be more functional after this update, and the patch notes indicate that it has resolved some issues with the user interface and heads-up display in Redsec and Multiplayer, in addition to better stability for the Battle Royale and Gauntlet modes.

Animal Crossing's 3.0 Update Just Killed Existing Hotel Businesses,"It’s a bad time to be in the Animal Crossing hotel business. New Horizons’ 3.0 update introduced a wave of new features, but one addition stands out above the rest: a fully fledged hotel that appears on the pier of every island. Overnight, that official beachfront resort has effectively put countless player-made hotels out of business. That might matter more if anyone besides Tom Nook--and the long-suffering players paying off his loans--actually exchanged money in New Horizons. Still, the arrival of an island-sanctioned hotel has made the decision to tear down pre-update resorts an easy one for many players who suddenly found their handmade creations obsolete. ""The fateful day has come for the new update, and the local resident-run hotel has fallen on hard times thanks to the illegally constructed hotel on the pier,"" wrote Redditor ll_LoneWolfe_ll in a post .

Some Of Monster Hunter Wilds' PC Issues Are Caused By Weird Glitch,"Earlier this month, some Monster Hunter Wilds players reported that the game actually performed better on Steam when it has more DLC installed. Word about that improvement spread quickly among the Monster Hunter Wilds community, but the real reason for the game's improvement isn't about whether the game has DLC. Instead, the problem arises when Monster Hunter Wilds checks for DLC. Digital Foundry debunked the notion that more DLC was speeding up Monster Hunter Wilds. Instead, DF discovered that there's an automatic check for DLC that greatly impacts Wilds' performance. According to the report, when the option for DLC content was offered, the game itself ""checked for DLC thousands upon thousands of times, adding to the CPU load of an already over-burdened processor"" in less than a minute. Essentially, this recurring issue in the hub area near a Support Desk Felynes has nothing to do with the DLC itself; it's happening because the game is constantly checking for DLC. That's slowing everything down, even if there isn't any DLC to be found. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Arc Raiders Will Get ""Multiple Maps"" This Year","Arc Raiders was one of the big hits from 2025, and Embark isn't going to let that momentum wane in 2026.

""There are going to be multiple maps coming this year,"" said Arc Raiders design lead Virgil Watkins during an interview with GamesRadar . ""And I think it's going to be across a spectrum of size to try to facilitate different types of gameplay. So you might see some that are smaller, and you might see some that are even grander than what we've got now."" Watkins didn't share specific details about what will be featured in the new maps, but he added that ""the ambition is to try to pair it with some new type of experience, whether that's the map conditions or weather conditions we put in that make the play feel different, enemy types or compositions feeling different, or we're escalating the types of loot available there.""

"Fallout Season 2 Viewership Numbers Are Way Down, But There Is An Obvious Reason Why","The newest Nielsen ratings have arrived, showing a gigantic drop-off for Fallout Season 2 compared to Fallout Season 1. However, there is an obvious explanation for the dip. According to The Hollywood Reporter , Fallout viewership reached 794 million minutes on Prime Video for the week of December 15-21, which covers when Season 2 debuted on December 16. Season 1 racked up 2.9 billion minutes of streaming time during its own opening week in April 2024. That's a 72% decrease, but the massive downturn was no doubt attributable to how the two seasons were released. Season 1, many may recall, was released in a binge format with all episodes arriving at the same time. Season 2, meanwhile, is adopting a weekly release schedule. What's more, just one episode of Fallout Season 2 was released on December 16, compared to two or three that Prime Video does for some of its other shows. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Online Auctions For Cory In The House DS Game Are Asking For Hundreds Amid Meme Campaign,"As part of a joke that is perhaps going too far, the markedly terrible Cory in the House game is not only closely trailing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 in user ratings, but sealed copies of it are priced for hundreds of dollars online. There are numerous listings for the Nintendo DS game on eBay , with prices ranging from $50 to $1,420.69 (har, har). One listing even has 44 bids and currently prices the game at $1,025.00. This bizarre event appears to stem from the Best Games by User Score list of GameSpot sister site Metacritic, which currently has 2025 Game of the Year winner Clair Obscur sitting at the top with a 9.6 user score. But because the internet loves a good gag, Cory in the House has recently surfaced as the runner-up with a score of 9.3, tied with The Witcher 3, two versions of Metal Gear Solid 3, the original Silent Hill 2, and a couple of other classics.

Helldivers 2 Is Letting Players Vote On Which Planet Gets Hit By Its Not-A-Death-Star,"Helldivers 2 prides itself on the concept of Managed Democracy, and in the latest example of crowdsourced decision-making, the game is asking players to choose a planet to blow up with a shiny new not-a-Death-Star superweapon. Fortunately, these planets aren't home to any brave Helldivers and are instead populated by the undemocratic factions that refuse to yield to Super Earth. The latest twist in the Helldivers 2 saga kicked off last week when Super Earth announced that it was upgrading the Democracy Space Station with the Star of Peace weapon. The platform can now fire a ""macro-scale laser"" optimized for ""mass Freedom dispensation"" that collapses an entire planet into a black hole. Helldivers players are now being asked to boot up the Democracy Space Station voting panel from their Galactic Map and choose one of three planets: Zagon Prime, Penta, or Valmox. These are held by the Terminids, Automatons, and Illuminate, respectively. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Hytale Guides Hub,"Hytale is the long-in-development Minecraft competitor from the team at Hypixel. What was once a very popular Minecraft server is now its own standalone experience that rivals Mojang's massive survival game in some ways, with plans to challenge it a lot more over time, no doubt. If you're jumping into Hytale to see what all the hype is about, you'll benefit from our guides on the game, which tackle the burning questions players may have as the game is now in early access. Starter guides The guides we have on Hytale for now all comfortably fit under one category: starter guides. This is because the game has only just launched and, by the studio's own admission, there's plenty of work still to be done . For now, you can jump into Hytale and enjoy an experience much like the early hours of Minecraft. You'll build a modest home, begin crafting objects, and probably wind up dead in a mine somewhere, only to respawn at your bed. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
All Armor Crafting Recipes In Hytale,"There are few things more important in Hytale than the armor your character equips. Armor can save you from dying to a dangerous mob when you're exploring at night or in a dark cave. It also plays a large part in how your character looks, which does play a factor in your experience if you play in third person. While you might have already figured out how to craft the most basic armor in Hytale, there are several more advanced options that offer stronger protection from mobs. The guide below shows you all of the current crafting recipes we have for armor in Hytale. As a note, some armor that you see in a Creative-mode world might not be available in Survival yet, similar to our guide on all Hytale weapons . Table of Contents [ hide ] How to craft armor in Hytale How to craft armor in Hytale A character donning some rare armor in Hytale If you view your character from the inventory screen in Hytale, you'll see that you have four available slots to equip armor. These slots are for your Helm, Gauntlets, Cuirass, and Greaves. For some reason, there is no dedicated boot slot, but maybe that will be added in a future update. You also have a slot for a shield, but that's not necessarily armor, so we won't be covering those crafting recipes. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
How To Increase Inventory Space In Hytale - Backpack Upgrade Guide,"Your starting inventory space in Hytale is likely all you need early on. You won't have access to a huge amount of resources or gear yet, so your inventory is plenty for what you need until you build a chest for extra storage. However, as you go along, you'll find more and more materials to pick up, which fills up your inventory quickly. While you might think you'll always be left with the default inventory size, that's not the case in Hytale. How to unlock the backpack in Hytale To increase the size of your inventory, you need to unlock and use the backpack in Hytale. The backpack is a separate item from the default inventory, but its sole goal is to give you more slots to put items. Fortunately, the backpack is unlocked fairly early on in Hytale, as all you have to do is upgrade your workbench to tier two. You can read about all Hytale workbenches in our previous guide, but getting a workbench to tier two requires the following resources: Continue Reading at GameSpot"

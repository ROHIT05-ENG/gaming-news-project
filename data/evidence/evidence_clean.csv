End-game boss? Spoiled. Every collectible location and what happens after you've collected every magic hat or whatever? Spoiled. Plot twists, because I might as well go all in at this point? Spoiled. If I don't learn it before the game comes out, I'll certainly know about it shortly after release thanks to research. (I learned what happened to Zelda in Tears of the Kingdom via Google Trends. Google bloody Trends .) Read more"
Skin Deep was this year's reminder that it's a privilege to recognise a developer's handwriting,"Out in space there are objects that orbit one another for so long, and at such a stately pace, that when they both eventually arrive at the same point, they don't collide with some kind of awful explosion. Instead, they just touch. They graze. They fuse. It's all very gentle. And then, over time, the two objects become one. Read more"
"In 2025, Winter Burrow showed how a little kindness goes a long way","In a loud world where everyone is battling to be heard, it's easy to forget that the quiet and smaller moments of kindness hold the most power. A lot of the time, it's easy to think that keeping to yourself is the easiest way to deal with things, whether you're dealing with your own pain or trying to find the right way to navigate someone else's. It's never easy to know what to do, we're all trying our best - after all this is all our first time being human. But one truth remains:a little kindness goes a long way. Winter Burrow, the intrepid little mouse game, shows this more than anything else I've played in 2025. Read more"

Blades of Fire and Hideo Kojima showed me I can still be surprised by a video game and that originality is essential,"I am pretty confident in my ability to judge video games. I've been playing them (increasingly badly over more recent years!) for almost 40 years and writing about them for over 20, so it's rare that something blindsides me.

I loved the studio's Castlevania rethink, Lords of Shadow, but was so-so on its output since, including the Nintendo-published Metroid Dread . My expectations for Blades of Fire were low to moderate.

Razer Is Teasing A Collaboration With One Of The Biggest Mecha Anime Of All time,"The popular anime franchise Neon Genesis Evangelion has had several crossovers with the tech world over the last couple of years, and now Razer is teasing a collaboration with the IP. While it's light on details, the brief teaser does hint that Razer will dig deep into Evangelion's signature visual language for its collaboration. Razer | EVANGELION エヴァ2号機 コレクション がまもなく。 #RazerXEVANGELION pic.twitter.com/V8Bpo0m2L2 — R Λ Z Ξ R 🇯🇵 (@RazerJP) January 8, 2026 One of the remarkable things about Neon Genesis Evangelion has been its evergreen art direction. The various mecha, graphic design elements, and iconography of the series have stood the test of time since the show debuted in 1995, and have evolved over the years through the Rebuild of Evangelion anime movies. The series has inspired a line of PC gaming hardware from Asus, vibrant Nvidia graphics cards decked out in Evangelion symbols and text, Govee's popular line of Evangelion gaming lights , and the recently released Casio Evangelion watch, an eye-catching celebration of the anime's 30th anniversary. If it's anything like Razer's Pokemon collection that launched last year, you can probably expect to see gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets get an Evangelion makeover. Razer launched a Pokemon Edition of its Cobra Wired Gaming Mouse alongside a matching BlackWidow V4 X Mechanical Keyboard and other items, dressing the gear up in vibrant Pikachu yellow and Pokemon icons.

"AAA Games' Future ""Lies In Smaller Teams,"" Says AC Unity Director","The creative director of Assassin's Creed Unity and Assassin's Creed Revelations , Alexandre Amancio, hasn't been shy about his belief that AAA game development is broken. Although Amancio has since left Ubisoft to serve as a senior vice president at FunPlus, he does have ideas about the future of AAA games and he believes that smaller dev teams are the way to go. Amancio told GamesIndustry.biz that a lot of AAA studios ""think that you can solve a problem by throwing people at it. But adding people to a problem stagnates the people that were already being efficient on it. It just creates a lot of variable noise ... So I think the future lies in smaller teams."" As an example of how smaller teams can collaborate on bigger projects, Amancio used Assassin's Creed: Black Flag as a hypothetical example. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
How The Elder Scrolls Online Is Going All-In On Seasons In 2026,"The Elder Scrolls Online in 2026 will look quite different from previous years, as developer ZeniMax Online Studios goes all-in on the game's new seasonal model that will see all of the game's content updates arrive free of charge. For years, ESO has followed a familiar, fairly typical MMO pattern of yearly paid chapter (expansion) releases. Those new chapters added new regions of Tamriel for players to explore, additional story content, optional paid DLCs, and, occasionally, things like new classes and systems. ZeniMax Online announced in 2024 that going forward, ESO wouldn't have a traditional yearly chapter release , labeling 2025 as a ""transitional"" year as the team prepared to focus on its plans for 2026. In a recent livestream and subsequent press Q&A attended by GameSpot, the developers have now revealed what ESO's 2026 will look like, and it includes more experimental seasonal content, battle passes, new story content, solo dungeons, a PvP progression system, class reworks, and more.The team also announced its long-term goals for the game, including that it's looking to finally introduce cross-play between platforms, as well as long-requested features such as guild mail and guild housing.

Closer to the end of the year, the Greymoor chapter will also become part of the base game. Currently, ESO players need to subscribe to the game's optional ESO Plus membership (around $15 a month) or purchase each DLC separately using the game's premium currency, Crowns, in order to access the content outlined above.

"The Elder Scrolls Online Is Finally Getting Cross-Play, But It Might Still Be A While","More than a decade after launch, The Elder Scrolls Online will finally get cross-play, as developer ZeniMax Online Studios has confirmed it's actively working on the feature.

While cross-play has long been something ZeniMax Online has said it wants to do and has explored options for, this is the first time the developer has confirmed it's actually happening, though there is not yet a clear idea of when, exactly, the feature will arrive. ""Cross-play is definitely coming, but it's going to be a while,"" ESO executive Susan Kath said as part of a virtual Q&A attended by GameSpot ahead of the game's 2026 preview livestream.

"Star Wars Outlaws Nintendo Switch 2 Price Drops Far, Far Below MSRP","Star Wars Outlaws Gold Edition (Switch 2) $30 (was $60) See at Amazon See at Walmart See at Best Buy See at Target Star Wars Outlaws Gold Edition for Nintendo Switch 2 is back on sale for 50% off at Amazon and Walmart . Normally $60, the impressive Switch 2 port of Massive Entertainment's open-world action-adventure game is discounted to only $30. This deal matches the price we saw in the lead-up to Christmas, though it's unclear when the new offer expires. If both retailers sell out, Star Wars Outlaws is on sale for $40 at Target and Best Buy . PS5 users can grab Star Wars Outlaws for $20 (was $50) at Amazon . Just know that the Switch 2's Gold Edition includes two story expansions and other in-game content, whereas the PlayStation 5 (and Xbox Series X) physical editions only come with the base game. Star Wars Outlaws Gold Edition (Switch 2) $30 (was $60) The Gold Edition is the only version available for Nintendo Switch 2. When Outlaws originally released on PS5, Xbox, and PC, the Gold Edition was $110, so Switch 2 owners were already getting a nice deal when Outlaws launched on the new Nintendo console in September. The Gold Edition is bundled with the Star Wars Outlaws Season Pass. Most notably, the Season Pass grants access to two story expansions called Wild Card and A Pirate's Fortune. You'll also get a few other extras. Here's the full list: Star Wars Outlaws Game-Key Card Requires 19.4GB download Season Pass Story Expansion 1 - Wild Card Story Expansion 2 - A Pirate's Fortune Exclusive Mission - Jabba's Gambit The Kessel Runner Character Pack (Cosmetics) The Hunter's Legacy Bundle (Cosmetics) The Cartel Ronin Bundle (Cosmetics) Star Wars Outlaws is a Game-Key Card with a roughly 20GB download. At launch, Ubisoft explained that storing the game data on a Switch 2 card negatively impacted performance, so the development team opted for the Game-Key Card format. From a performance perspective, Outlaws is one of the most impressive third-party games on Switch 2. It runs in 1440p resolution at 30fps in docked mode and 1080p at 30fps in handheld mode. It's certainly a downgrade in graphics compared to PS5, Xbox, and PC, but Outlaws makes great use of DLSS, VRR, and ray-tracing to offer solid visuals and consistent performance with minimal drops. Considering Star Wars Outlaws runs terribly on Steam Deck--it's marked as ""unsupported""--it's cool that Massive Entertainment found a way to make a pleasant handheld experience on Switch 2. See at Amazon See at Walmart See at Best Buy Set during the height of the Galactic Empire's reign, Outlaws puts you in the boots of Kay Vess, an opportunistic lawbreaker chasing down a score that'll help pay off the debts she owes to the criminal underworld of Star Wars. The third-person action-adventure unfolds on and between five planets in the galaxy. Four of the planets have an open-world design that encourages exploration. Outlaws is a well-rounded experience that mixes gunplay with stealth and hand-to-hand combat. You can customize your character and your ship, the Trailblazer, which you control when traveling across the galaxy. And yes, Star Wars Outlaws has space combat, too. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Minecraft Is Getting Even Cuter With New Baby Mobs,"Baby mobs have been around Minecraft for a while, but these creatures are getting an adorable makeover for a future update. Mojang Studios has shared a first look at its upcoming baby mob remasters, which is currently being tested.

In the accompanying announcement video, game director Agnes Larsson explains that previous baby mobs were just scaled down versions of the adult creatures.

South Park X Fortnite Includes New 5-Person Mode And Free Mini-Pass,"The long-rumored Fortnite collab with South Park is now official, as Epic Games dropped a new short film that shows how the boys are going to get sucked into the metaverse. We also got some specifics about what the collab will entail: a new five-player mode for Battle Royale, a free mini-pass through which players can earn South Park cosmetics, and at least five skins in the item shop. Oh, and Wonkeeland on the BR map will become Cartmanland. Using a short film to reveal the collab is something that Fortnite recently also did for its Simpsons-themed season in November--a Fortnite collaboration being something else that The Simpsons did before Butters could. The brief video, which includes a gameplay teaser at the end, shows us that the boys are avid Fortnite players, but Butters never gets to play with them since squads are capped at four players. So he tries to use the Stick of Truth to make them play with him, but it doesn't go quite the way he thought it would. South Park's intrusion into Fortnite will come with several changes for Battle Royale. Wonkeeland is now Cartmanland, there will be a Cheesy Poofs healing item and a Stick of Truth mythic weapon, and for the first time you'll be able to play Fortnite's main mode in a group of five. Beyond that, this collaboration will also include an event pass--something Fortnite used to do regularly until the end of Chapter 5. This pass will be free to everyone, and we don't know anything about what it will include. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Roguelikes Are More Popular Than Ever And It's Becoming A Problem,"For any studio, garnering enough interest and success in a video game to the point where a sequel is justified is a commendable feat. And yet, when you're navigating a space that's growing ever more saturated--such as the case of roguelikes and roguelites--a sequel can become a necessary evil rather than a cherished opportunity to further explore existing ideas. The roguelike genre is brimming with creativity, and the efforts of small studios over the years have led to a plethora of dedicated communities. Popularity broke containment years ago, with bigger industry names giving the genre a spin. Some have introduced modes separately from the main experience, including Prey: Mooncrash, God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla, and the Freelancer mode for Hitman: World of Assassination, to name a few examples. Others, like Returnal and Elden Ring Nightreign, introduced themselves as AAA productions of these concepts. As more developers continue to push boundaries in the space, whether that is Balatro and Buckshot Roulette kicking off a wave of engrossing gambling-inspired games, or studios still trying to capitalize on the Vampire Survivors formula, there has been a steady trend that, in some ways, is holding developers back. Put simply, the space is being overcrowded by sequels. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"Microsoft Exec Dismisses Mass Layoff Report: ""100% Made Up""","If you spend any time on social media, whether that be Bluesky or X, you may have seen some reports going around that Microsoft is preparing to cut tens of thousands of jobs amidst the rising costs of artificial intelligence.

A report on the site TipRanks said that Microsoft is ""considering massive layoffs"" this month, with the plan to cut anywhere between 11,000 and 22,000 jobs on the Azure Cloud, Xbox, and global sales teams.

The deal is also notable for another reason: Lego no longer manufactures the Tree House. After five years on the market, the Lego Ideas Tree House retired in November 2024. The Lego Store and most major retailers ran out of units over a year ago; Amazon is the only major retailer still selling the Lego Ideas Tree House. Lego Ideas Tree House (3,036 pieces) $217 (was $250) | Officially Retired Nov. 2024 The intricately designed 3,036-piece Lego Tree House measures 10 x 9 x 14 inches when built. It comes with two sets of leaves. For a summer look, you can decorate the tree with dark and bright green Lego elements. Alternatively, you can give the tree an autumn appearance with yellow and brown leaves. One neat aspect here is that Lego used sustainable plant-based plastic to manufacture the roughly 180 pieces of tree foliage. Along with two different display modes, the Lego Tree House has numerous modular components and interactive features, including a supply basket attached to a functional wind-up crane and removable roofs on the three distinct cabin rooms: main bedroom, kids' room, and bathroom. The set comes with a family of four Lego minifigures representing mom, dad, and two kids as well as a bird figure. You'll build bunk beds for the kids' room and a larger bed for the main bedroom. Each room is filled with accessories and decorations such as a treasure map, a ship in a bottle, and a compass. The main bedroom has a balcony where you can pull up the basket of supplies. You'll also build a sink, bathtub, and toilet for the bathroom. A brick-built ladder spirals down to the landscape base, where the minifigure family can eat lunch at the brick-built picnic table, enjoy the afternoon breeze on the swing, and get warm by the bonfire. The multi-colored base has various plants as well as a buildable stream. See at Amazon Lego Ideas Tree House (3,036 pieces) Amazon has deals on a number of other Lego Ideas and Lego Icons building sets for adults. Disney fans can pick up the Disney Pixar Luxo Jr. lamp for just $64.20 (was $70), and since it's fully posable, it makes for a fun addition to a home office or theater. This marks the first time it's been on sale. Vincent Van Gogh: The Starry Night is also seeing a slight discount to $150 (was $170). It's similar in scope to the Tree House at over 2,300 pieces, and it can be mounted on a wall for easy display. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Arc Raiders Dormant Barons Quest Guide,"Early on in the Arc Raiders questline, you'll be sent to find and loot a Baron Husk. The Dormant Barons quest may sound a bit scary--big Arc can be quite frightening, after all--but these bad boys have long been dead, so you have nothing to worry about when looting their husks. However, finding a Baron Husk may take a bit more searching than you'd like--unless you take a look at our guide below. Here's where to find Baron Husks and how to loot them. Where to find Baron Husks Baron Husks are large, destroyed Arc that can be found on multiple maps, but the safest and most easily accessible map to search for them on is Dam Battlegrounds. This map is the first one you'll have access to at the beginning of your journey, and it contains a total of three Baron Husks you can visit. We've marked the locations on the map below. Baron Husk locations on Dam Battlegrounds We'd recommend visiting one of the Baron Husks on the left side of the map, as the one at the Breach is in a very exposed area and often has a Sentinel turret scouting the area. It's better to be safe than sorry. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Arc Raiders A Bad Feeling Quest Guide,"Arc Raiders quests can sometimes get pretty complicated, demanding you venture across multiple maps to complete various objectives. A Bad Feeling isn't one of these, though, as it asks something quite simple of you: Just open an Arc Probe or Arc Courier. But where exactly will you find one of these, and what will you find inside? We're here to answer that for you, so read on for where to find Arc Probes and Arc Couriers. Table of Contents [ hide ] Where to find Arc Probes Where to find Arc Probes You may occasionally see a fresh Arc Probe come in from the sky (keep an eye out for something that looks like a rocket coming down). These will be standing straight up once they land. However, these aren't likely to be the probes you normally come across, as most Arc Probes are found tipped over on their sides. In either case, you can hear Arc Probes from some distance--listen for their odd bleeps and bloops emitting every few seconds. Arc Probe While they're found in randomized spots all across every map, Arc Probes are considerably more common during the Electromagnetic Storm map event. During the event, check the roof of the Testing Annex on the Dam Battlegrounds map to score at least 2-3 of them in the same spot--which is a great way to start getting your points up if you're trying to knock out an Open Arc Probes weekly trial that may be active.

Arc Raiders Back On Top Quest Guide,"Quests in Arc Raiders most frequently require you to visit only one map, but you'll occasionally encounter some that send you across multiple maps to complete them. One of these quests is Back on Top, which asks you to visit all four launch maps and mark specific buildings. It's not a particularly challenging quest, but it can be rather time consuming due to the amount of travel time needed to reach each building on the maps. As such, we've compiled the locations of all four buildings you need to mark. When you're ready to get this quest underway, follow the steps below. Table of Contents [ hide ] Mark the Pattern House Mark the Pattern House The Pattern House is located at the northern tip of the Dam Battlegrounds map.

This is a recent game that, on replay, feels like a curious time capsule, a slice of game design that has become far less common since its release.

According to the Steam charts , Highguard peaked at over 97,000 concurrent players shortly after its debut. That number may have put a significant strain on the game's servers. It's currently dropped down to just over 11,000 concurrent players. If the crashes are due to an issue on the game's end, developer Wildlight Entertainment will likely patch it out. If the crashes are happening due to players' computers these are the recommended steps to take at this time: Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Two New Friday The 13th 4K Steelbook Blu-Rays Are Up For Preorder At Amazon,"Friday the 13th (2009) Reprint $32 (was $50) | Releases February 3 Preorder at Amazon Friday the 13th: Part 2 45th Anniversary Edition $27 (was $31) | Releases February 3 Preorder at Amazon Friday the 13th is getting a duo of new 4K Blu-ray SteelBook releases next month. The 2009 remake 4K Blu-ray was originally released as a limited edition back in 2024, but swiftly sold out. Luckily, a new reprint is available preorder at Amazon for $37.49 (was $50). Then there's the Friday the 13: Part 2 45th Anniversary Edition 4K SteelBook, which comes with a handful of new bonus features, available to preorder for $24.49 (was $31). Both titles will release simultaneously on February 3, 2026. Friday the 13th (2009) Reprint $32 (was $50) | Releases February 3 The 2009 remake was a pretty faithful recreation of the campy original thanks to director Marcus Nispel, who also remade The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in 2003. This 4K Blu-ray SteelBook from Arrow Video comes with a reversible sleeve with new artwork. Below are all the special features included: Audio Commentary with the Filmmakers Interviews with the Filmmakers Delete Scenes Image Gallery A Killer New Beginning Video Essay Excerpts from the Terror Trivia Track The Rebirth of Jason Voorhees Archival Featurette Hacking Back/ Slashing Forward Archival Featurette The 7 Best Kills Archival Featurette Preorder at Amazon Friday the 13th: Part 2 45th Anniversary Edition $27 (was $31) | Releases February 3 The 1981 follow up to the iconic original, this 45th Anniversary Edition of Friday the 13th: Part 2 is a two-disc featuring a remastered version of the film and some new special features. The story picks up five years after the end of the first movie, with another group of stubborn teens fallen victim to the hockey mask-clad killer. Here are the special features you can look forward to: Inside ""Crystal Lake Memories"" Friday's Legacy: Horror Conventions Lost Tales From Camp Blood - Part 2 Jason Forever Featurette Original Theatrical Trailer Preorder at Amazon The Friday the 13th franchise is one of the most iconic slasher series in the history of the medium, spanning 12 movies and even a handful of video game adaptations . We've seen Jason go from his backwoods roots to New York City, and even a short stint in space (yes, really). The 2009 remake retells the original story well, hitting every big story beat, ridiculous kill scenes, and the twist in a very faithful way. Friday the 13th: Part 2 is a direct follow-up to the first one, following a new group for Jason to stalk. Both movies come in premium SteelBook cases, and the remake reprint includes brand-new cover art by artist Gary Pullin, reversible -- one side features the retro look of the original, while the other is the original poster for the remake. If you're unfamiliar, SteelBook cases are roughly the same size as a typical plastic Blu-ray case but much sturdier, and they often feature alternate art and other physical bonuses. For physical media collectors, the spines look really nice on a bookshelf, and these two horror movies are no different. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Veteran Mario Kart Director Retires From Nintendo After Four Decades,"Hideki Konno, a longtime director for Nintendo, has resigned from the video game publisher. Konno confirmed the news on his Facebook page months ago, which largely went unnoticed by the press at the time. His last month at Nintendo was July 2025. The fans at the Famiboard Forums were the first to notice Konno's employment update, which has since blown up online. Konno joined Nintendo in 1986, and worked as a designer and assistant director on Super Mario Bros. 2 and Super Mario Bros. 3. He also directed Yoshi's Island and SimCity for the SNES, and Luigi's Mansion for the GameCube. Konno's most enduring work was on the Mario Kart franchise. He directed the first two games, Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, in addition to producing Mario Kart DS, Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 7, Mario Kart 8, and Mario Kart Tour. Although Konno didn't work on the most recent game, he received a special thanks credit in Mario Kart World. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

How To Start New Game Plus In Code Vein 2,"Code Vein 2 is a challenging Soulslike with tense and aggressive combat, as well as plenty of anime drama and compelling characters that should keep you invested throughout its fairly lengthy campaign . It's a lot to take on, even for genre veterans--especially if you're looking to tackle all three of its endings. However, you won't necessarily need to see them all through to access a second playthrough of the game. If you're really eager to see things through a second time, you can start NG+ in Code Vein 2 and try it all again. In Code Vein 2's NG+ mode, you'll start the story from the beginning and lose your map and mission progress. However, you'll take all the levels you've earned and items you've acquired into this fresh run of the campaign, giving you a bit of an edge in combat and beyond--especially during the first few hours. But NG+ also beefs up the enemies and bosses you'll encounter, too, granting them harder-hitting attacks and more health. So, you shouldn't expect to breeze your way through the whole thing. Code Vein 2 doesn't exactly point you toward NG+ after beating the story, though, leaving this feature for you to discover on your own. Luckily, you won't have to stray too far to get started, if that's your goal. Here's how to start NG+ in Code Vein 2. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
How Long To Beat Code Vein 2,"Soulslike games are known for their punishing combat and tense exploration, and Code Vein 2 delivers both alongside a time-traveling story and sprawling open world. There's certainly a lot to see in this anime RPG, especially for those interested in checking out all of its optional content, so it's not the kind of game you'll wrap up in an afternoon. Instead, you'll want to strap in for a dense and challenging outing that should keep you occupied longer than you may expect. Just how much time will you spend in this one, though? Let's take a look at how long it takes to beat Code Vein 2. How long is Code Vein 2? How long it takes you to beat Code Vein 2 will depend on a variety of factors, such as how well you adapt to its aggressive Soulslike combat, how much open world content you seek out, and how many of its character-based side-quests you complete. There's a substantial amount of content to discover for those who take the time to see it all. A playthrough of Code Vein 2 that focuses almost exclusively on pushing through its main story content is likely to take most players at least 25 hours . That being said, the game's overall difficulty is partially based on just how much of its additional objectives you tackle, as time spent in the open world and doing side-quests means earning more levels (thus, improved stats), better equipment, and more healing upgrades.

"Reanimal Release Date, Trailer, Gameplay, And Everything Else We Know","Reanimal is an upcoming horror-adventure game from Tarsier Studios, the creators of Little Nightmares and Little Nightmares II. Players control two children striving to survive and uncover the dark secrets of a hostile island that was once their home.

Arc Raiders Will Let Solo Players Take On Squads After Headwinds Update,"Embark Studios has gone into more detail about what players can expect from the Headwinds update for Arc Raiders , which drops on January 27. Its most notable addition is ""Solo vs. Squads"" matchmaking, which no longer restricts solo players from only playing with other solo players. Previously, it was impossible for those playing Arc Raiders by themselves to queue into matches where squads of players working together were also present. After the Headwinds update drops, players who are over level 40 can choose to use Solo vs. Squads matchmaking to allow for that. This will likely make Arc Raiders much harder for you, as squads tend to be more aggressive than solo players , but the XP bonuses and rewards will be greater for solo players.

"Highguard Devs Are ""Confident"" It's Not Going Away","After going all quiet on the digital front for six weeks, Wildlight Entertainment's free-to-play fantasy shooter Highguard is officially out on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. If you were concerned about the game's longevity, you can rest easy because the company's co-founder and CEO said it isn't going anywhere. Speaking to Variety on launch day --January 26--Dusty Welch said that Highguard is nothing like Concord or Overwatch (even though it sort of rhymes with the former and is kind of synonymous with the latter). Specifically, Welch noted that, unlike the previous two games (which have been unceremoniously shut down), Highguard won't suffer a similar fate anytime soon. (It's worth mentioning that although Overwatch shut down, Overwatch 2 rose up in its place and has updates planned. Concord, however, is dead and gone.) ""What we're confident in is that we're not going anywhere,"" Welch explained. ""We're not going away. We as a team have a lot of experience in building franchises that have staying power. And this one, as [co-founder and game director Chad Grenier] alluded to, we have a year's worth of content that's near completion that is going to engage an audience for quite a bit of time. So we're excited to be able to bring that. We have the experience, but that said, we're humbled, and we hope people love this--but we're ready to engage with them."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Highguard Has Several Voice Cast Members You'll Recognize From Other Games,"Behind the cast of characters (or Wardens) of Highguard are voice actors who you've certainly heard before in recent video games. Having just launched the free-to-play raid shooter, developer Wildlight Entertainment shared a thread announcing the game's 10 main cast members. Leading the cast is Abubakar Salim, best known as the voice of Bayek in Assassin's Creed Origins, in the role of Atticus, the Warden at the center of most of Highguard's promotion materials. He's joined by Robbie Daymond (Chai in Hi-Fi Rush) as Slade, Cherami Leigh (female V in Cyberpunk 2077) as Scarlet, and Emily O'Brien (Amelie in Death Stranding) as the non-playable Air Operator. When you’re fighting for the Shieldbreaker, riding out to raid, or visiting Trader Flynn, these are the incredibly talented voice actors you’ll be hearing!

Bizarre TGA Closer Highguard Reaches Nearly 100K Concurrent Players Day-One On Steam,"Wildlight Entertainment's free-to-play shooter Highguard is finally out on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S after weeks of silence, and already, the game has almost eclipsed 100,000 concurrents on Steam. If you check out the Most Played chart on Steam, you'll see that Highguard is clutching the number 10 spot (97,249 current) , fending off the 2023 RPG Baldur's Gate 3 (84,313 current) at the time of this writing. It's nowhere to be found in the PC gaming distributor's Top Sellers chart , but that's probably because this list tracks the best-selling games by revenue, and while Highguard's monetization strategy is pretty standard stuff for a free-to-play game , it doesn't appear to have set the charts on fire. There is also a year-one roadmap with an update dropping every two months starting in February. This is surprising for the sheer fact that, until this very moment , no one really knew anything about the game. Up until it launched on January 26 for consoles and PC, there had been no combat overviews, no hero showcases, no lore explanations--nothing. And yet, despite the very little marketing-- aside from popping up in the closing slot at The Game Awards on December 11 --Highguard is seemingly attracting an audience. Whether that's mild curiosity or outright fascination remains to be seen, but over 300K people are watching the game being livestreamed on Twitch right now. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Highguard Studio Isn't Concerned With Accruing Massive Player Counts On Launch Day,"One of the developers behind Highguard says the concurrent player count for the new first-person shooter does not need ""to be super huge in order to be successful.""

A flurry of interviews with the game's developers are also revealing more about the game that's now in players' hands. Lead Designer Mohammad Alavi shared the aforementioned sentiment about player count in a group interview attended by PC Gamer , saying that Highguard finding a core, passionate community that can grow is more important. ""Honestly, we don't need [player counts] to be super huge in order to be successful,"" he explained. ""We're a small team. A six-player match [Highguard's max player count at launch] is not hard to find. What we're really hoping for is a core group of fans that love us. That will allow us to grow. Being the ire of the internet hate machine sucks, but at the same time, I try to just focus on making the best game I can and getting that game into people's hands. At the end of the day, that's all that really matters."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Although Solidaires Informatique called for a one-day strike against Ubisoft last week, Le Monde is reporting that only 10 people showed up for that protest. However, more protests are planned for the near future. ""At this stage, it seems clear to us that [Ubisoft CEO] Yves Guillemot has no knowledge or understanding of his company or its employees,"" said Marc Rutschlé, a union representative at Ubisoft Paris. ""The company is continuing its cost reduction and lay off plan. Our teams are already working under pressure, often understaffed. After several years without pay rises (or very small increases), we understand that once again, employees will not receive a raise this year. At the same time, the reorganization is creating a number of high-level positions with excessive salaries."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Highguard Was Planned As A Shadow-Drop, But Geoff Keighley Had Another Idea","Highguard developer Wildlight Entertainment has revealed it originally planned to shadow-drop its free-to-play ""raid shooter,"" until host Geoff Keighley offered to highlight it as the final reveal of 2025's The Game Awards instead. In an interview with GameSpot, studio cofounder and game director Dusty Welch said the plan was always for Highguard to be a ""quiet shadow-drop."" It's a strategy that worked well for Apex Legends , the popular free-to-play battle royale that many of the Highguard team at Wildlight previously worked on, he said. That was the plan, at least until Keighley told Wildlight he loved the game and had an idea. He wanted to highlight the free-to-play shooter from an independent studio as part of the show, according to Welch. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Highguard Just Launched, But It Already Has A 2026 Roadmap","Highguard , the high-fantasy shooter from former Respawn Entertainment devs, will receive six major updates in 2026, introducing new playable characters, weapons, maps, and more.

At launch, Highguard will include eight playable Wardens (aka heroes), as well as 10 weapons, three raid tools, five maps, six bases, and three mounts to choose from (a horse, cat, and bear).

Highguard Is A Fresh Enough Combo That It Could Be The Start Of A Whole New Thing,"While it is not the next game from the studio that brought us the likes of Titanfall 2 or Apex Legends , Highguard is coming from many former members of the Respawn team--developer Wildlight is about 100 employees and more than 60 worked on Titanfall 2 and/or Apex Legends. Highguard does not look anything like those games, though. The reveal trailer for Highguard saw you riding a horse, not piloting a mech, and casting fantastical magic instead of utilizing sci-fi tech. But the trailer did not do much to tell us what the game actually is. So for about two months now, I have been looking for the answer to one question: What is Highguard? Having now finally played Highguard, I am still unsure if I can actually classify it. If put on the spot, I would probably describe Highguard as a first-person shooter that follows both the attacker-versus-defender structure of Rainbow Six Siege and the lane-focused bomb-planting format of Valorant , but within the much larger objective-focused, base-destroying scope of the space battles of Star Wars Battlefront 2 . And on top of that, the game features an upgradable armament system that combines how looting works in Apex Legends with the ""shopping"" mechanic of Call of Duty's Zombies mode, as well as hero-character archetypes seen in a ton of different shooters. You have played or experienced pieces of Highguard in other games, but I feel very confident in saying that you have probably not played this exact chimera of pieces before. You remember that sensation the first time you ever played a battle royale, or looter shooter, or extraction shooter? There are pieces of those genres we can identify in many different games that came before them, but with the earliest games in each of those genres, there was this sensation of novelty and inventiveness. They could not easily fit into the established boxes of the existing genres that inspired them. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"RuneScape Dev Takes ""Hard Line Stance"" On AI","RuneScape developer Jagex has made its stance on AI clear, stating that it will never use the technology to create in-game content. In an interview with GamesIndustry.biz , Jagex senior vice president of product James Dobrowski made it known where the MMORPG developer draws the line when it comes to AI use. ""We've got a pretty hard line stance with the team, which is a commitment that no generative AI will ever be present in any asset that a player can touch, hear, or feel,"" Dobrowski said.

"MLB The Show 26 Won't Have A ""New Cover Athlete,"" Studio Says In Cheeky Statement","The developers behind MLB The Show 26 appear to be up to something, sharing a curious announcement stating that the upcoming baseball game won't have a cover athlete like entries in the series traditionally do. But the wording leaves open several possibilities. A Twitter/X post on the official MLB The Show account reads: ""We know that you are all just as excited as we are for the release of MLB The Show 26, so we wanted to let everyone know that this year we have decided that we will not have a new cover athlete."" The sly message urges readers to ""stay tuned"" for further news. Many in the replies were quick to point out that this statement doesn't rule out that a previous cover athlete could feature on the boxart. A looser reading of the statement could also take it as multiple athletes gracing the cover; last year's MLB The Show 25 featured three players : Paul Skenes, Elly De La Cruz, and Gunnar Henderson. If you want to let your imagination run wild, feel free to picture MLB mascots making the cover this year as well. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"Super Mario Galaxy Movie Release Date Changes, New Trailer Introduces Yoshi And Birdo","Earlier this month, Nintendo announced a Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct , and it was one of the shortest Directs that the publisher has ever had. But the new trailer for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie may be worth it, because it introduces everyone's favorite dinosaur, Yoshi. Additionally, the movie's release date has shifted. It was previously set for release on April 3, but it's now coming on April 1--that is no April Fools joke. The beginning of the trailer features Mario and Luigi's first encounter with Yoshi. By the time the Mario brothers introduce him to Toad, they're very attached to their new pal. But Yoshi wasn't the only familiar face to show up in the movie-verse for the first time. Birdo--an enemy from Super Mario Bros. 2--appeared to be fighting Princess Peach with her signature flying egg attack. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Ubisoft Suggests Cutting Up To 200 Jobs Following Company Restructuring,"After last week's news that Ubisoft would split its development teams into five "" creative houses "" overseeing specific projects, the company has announced a proposal to cut up to 200 jobs in its international offices, particularly in Paris, France. According to an email sent to staff on January 26 and reported on by VGC , Ubisoft has entered negotiations with French unions for a Rupture Conventionnelle Collective (RCC). An RCC is a voluntary mutual termination agreement that gives French companies the option to cut their workforce as long as a collective agreement is reached with unions and validated by French authorities. Until then, no decision will be finalized, and the deal only impacts the company's International employees who hold French contracts. An Ubisoft spokesperson told VGC that, since this ""mutual termination"" only impacts the company's French headquarters, only about 200 jobs could be eliminated. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"BioShock Creator: ""You Can't Really Do Anything Now Without Somebody Getting Upset About Something""","BioShock creator Ken Levine has discussed some of the blowback to 2007's BioShock, and specifically around the game's Little Sisters and how there were calls to remove them from the game. He also discussed the current climate of online discourse in a wide-ranging interview. Speaking to Reason , Levine said there was a ""contingent"" of people pushing him to ""get rid of the Little Sisters"" out of fear of public backlash. For anyone just catching up, Little Sisters are people in BioShock who carry a valuable resource in their stomach, and people can decide to kill them to harvest the resource, or not. ""I wanted to give that economic question to the player,"" Levine said. ""People did talk to me about it and they were very concerned. And that element almost got pulled from the game because the publisher got nervous. But we had a great defender of ours at the publisher who said, 'No, without that there's no game.' And so they let us do it,"" he explained. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
PlayStation State Of Play Reportedly Planned For February,"Valentine's Day might not be the only event to get excited about in February, as Sony is supposedly set to host a new PlayStation State of Play next month. Reliable leaker NateTheHate2 answered in the affirmative on X when asked about the possibility. Intriguingly, this comes just mere days after stating he wasn't aware of any plans. Betting on a PlayStation State of Play for February isn't some longshot. Sony is going on five years in a row of highlighting PS5 games during that month--dating back to 2021. So if this event becomes official, that would make it six years straight. As for what could be showcased, Marvel's Wolverine and Saros seem the most likely, though NateTheHate2 didn't supply any additional details. The last PlayStation State of Play took place a couple of months ago in November, with the focus being on PS5 titles developed in Japan. Marvel Tokon: Fighting Heroes, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined, and Fatal Frame: Crimson Butterfly 2 were a handful of the games discussed. Meanwhile, Marvel's Wolverine and Saros got the spotlight in the PlayStation State of Play in September . Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Any Control Resonant Release Date Information Is “Speculation,” Dev Says","Following its reveal at The Game Awards on December 11, developer Remedy Entertainment announced that the Control sequel--now known as Control Resonant --will launch sometime this year. And that's all we know about that for now, because any other release date information you may see circulating online is pure speculation, according to the team's communications director. Thomas Puha has been at Remedy Entertainment for almost 11 years, per his LinkedIn , serving as the Finnish studio's communications director the entire time. It's safe to assume he knows a thing or two about relaying important developer information to the masses, which is why he took to X on January 26 to reiterate that Control Resonant doesn't have a firm release date right now. ""Since some news are crediting us saying something, that we havent,"" Puha said in an X post . ""Remedy has only ever communicated that the release window of Control Resonant is 2026. Anything else is speculation."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Xbox Boss Talks Competition With GTA 6: There Are ""Always Other Games""","Barring any further delays, Rockstar Games will release Grand Theft Auto VI this November, and it's expected to have a massive launch.

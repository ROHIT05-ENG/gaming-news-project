According to Steam's usual end-of-year thing, the exploratory space sim is by far my most played game of 2025, accounting for - somewhat incredibly - nearly 20 percent of my total playtime.

"Penises set Dispatch apart, and I mean that quite sincerely","I think a lot of Dispatch can be distilled into a single moment at the beginning of the game when the player comes face to face with a penis. There it is, dangling visibly between the legs of an unclothed, toxic-drenched super-villain you're about to fight. The camera all but centers on it. There's no way you can miss it unless you've flipped the nudity switch off, in which case it's replaced by an even more conspicuous black box that only amplifies the naughtiness of the part hidden within. But most people don't turn nudity off because they're expecting boobs. That's what we usually see. In Dispatch, however, it's a penis we see waggling unavoidably on our screens. Read more"
"Donkey Kong Bananza might not be the best game of the year, but it's surely the one I loved the most","I think these days, after years of Nintendo outright eschewing the console power rat race and focusing instead on different ways to play and honing their core craft, we forget that Nintendo is still a pretty sharp company in terms of technical innovation. Raw power went aside with the Wii, but the company's dedication to tinkering around the edges to create stand-out original experiences in other ways remained - or perhaps even intensified. There's been a lot of examples over the years, of course, from clever game design innovations to zany peripherals - but Donkey Kong Bananza has to be one of the finest showcases of that thinking from Nintendo in years.

"Despelote showed me the year's greatest intro sequence, and its greatest advert for video games full stop","I'm going to spoil the opening of Despelote here - an opening which I think, as you can probably tell, is pretty glorious.

"In 2025, Deltarune reminded me of the joy and importance of secret hunting","A guide writer talking about how her favourite gaming related moment of 2025 was uncovering secrets? Who saw that coming… Seriously though, let me tell you about a little downside of my job: if we're covering a game, or considering doing so, I have to spoil everything for myself for planning purposes. End-game boss? Spoiled. Every collectible location and what happens after you've collected every magic hat or whatever? Spoiled. Plot twists, because I might as well go all in at this point? Spoiled. If I don't learn it before the game comes out, I'll certainly know about it shortly after release thanks to research. (I learned what happened to Zelda in Tears of the Kingdom via Google Trends. Google bloody Trends .) Read more"
Skin Deep was this year's reminder that it's a privilege to recognise a developer's handwriting,"Out in space there are objects that orbit one another for so long, and at such a stately pace, that when they both eventually arrive at the same point, they don't collide with some kind of awful explosion. Instead, they just touch. They graze. They fuse. It's all very gentle. And then, over time, the two objects become one. Read more"
"In 2025, Winter Burrow showed how a little kindness goes a long way","In a loud world where everyone is battling to be heard, it's easy to forget that the quiet and smaller moments of kindness hold the most power. A lot of the time, it's easy to think that keeping to yourself is the easiest way to deal with things, whether you're dealing with your own pain or trying to find the right way to navigate someone else's. It's never easy to know what to do, we're all trying our best - after all this is all our first time being human. But one truth remains:a little kindness goes a long way. Winter Burrow, the intrepid little mouse game, shows this more than anything else I've played in 2025. Read more"

Eurogamer's Alternate Game Awards 2025,"The year is over! Or near enough.

As everyone else is putting their minds together to come up with awards in a range of arbitrary categories, we thought it was only right that we did the same in celebration of this strange old year and some of the great, funny, wild, stupid, and bad things that have happened in it - with our tongue firmly planted in our cheek.

Blades of Fire and Hideo Kojima showed me I can still be surprised by a video game and that originality is essential,"I am pretty confident in my ability to judge video games. I've been playing them (increasingly badly over more recent years!) for almost 40 years and writing about them for over 20, so it's rare that something blindsides me. But that's exactly what happened with Blades of Fire , the action soulslike adventure from Mercury Steam. I loved the studio's Castlevania rethink, Lords of Shadow, but was so-so on its output since, including the Nintendo-published Metroid Dread . My expectations for Blades of Fire were low to moderate. Incredible, then, that I've not played another game released this year that I enjoyed more. Read more"

The 10% discount discount matches the all-time best price for the Switch 2 exclusive's physical edition. And the last time Amazon discounted Bananza to $63 was in August, one week after launch.

Save Over 50% On David Lynch's Dune Adaptation On 4K Blu-Ray,"David Lynch's Dune: Special Edition (4K Blu-ray) $21.80 (was $50) See at Amazon A Masterpiece in Disarray: David Lynch's Dune, An Oral History $20.50 (was $30) See at Amazon If you're a big fan of Frank Herbert's Dune and/or movies made by legendary director David Lynch , check out Amazon's deal on the 4K UHD restoration of the late filmmaker's highly ambitious and divisive 1984 adaptation. Arrow Video's stellar 4K Blu-ray edition of David Lynch's Dune is up for grabs for only $21.80 (was $50). Dune is one of many 4K Blu-rays in Amazon's 50% off Arrow Video movies promotion ; it's also not the only Dune adaptation on 4K Blu-ray for super cheap right now. Save over 50% on Dune 4K Blu-rays: David Lynch's Dune -- $21.80 ( $50 ) Dune: Prophecy Season 1 -- $17 ( $40 ) with coupon Dune: Part One -- $14.49 ( $30 ) Dune: Part Two -- $15 ( $30 ) The ultra-violent and often disorienting film was exceedingly unpopular with critics and fans, but it has garnered a cult following over the years. It's a fascinating adaptation that's worth revisiting, and Arrow Video's 4K Blu-ray edition is the best way to watch it today. If you're at all interested in Dune or David Lynch or the filmmaking process, I'd highly recommend pairing the 4K Blu-ray with the massive behind-the-scenes book titled A Masterpiece in Disarray: David Lynch's Dune, An Oral History . The 560-page, limited-edition book is thoroughly entertaining--and it doesn't hurt that it doubles as a stunning display piece. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Overwatch 2 Season 20 Midcycle Introduces Showdown Shuffle,"The middle of Overwatch 2 Season 20 has arrived, and the midcycle is bringing the chaos with new modes, new loot, and new in-game collectibles. One of the most notable new additions is Showdown Shuffle, which runs January 13-26. This mode is going to change which character you're controlling, often at random intervals. Showdown Shuffle locks players into a role, but not a particular hero. Instead, hero swaps can occur when players reach certain milestones for kills or assists, or even when players are eliminated. According to Blizzard, this was done to encourage players to experiment with new characters and adapt on the fly. Showdown Shuffle will be a 5v5 battle available in Control, Hybrid, Escort, Push, and Flashpoint. Match modifiers will also change throughout the battle for more unpredictable outcomes. Starting today through January 11, Assault will return during a Quick Play Hacked event that brings back classic Overwatch maps Temple of Anubis, Hanamura, and Volskaya Industries. It's a fitting start the year, considering that 2026 will mark the 10th anniversary of Overwatch. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Rockstar's Battle With Union Over Fired Devs Goes To Court,"Near the end of October 2025, Rockstar fired over thirty devs in the United Kingdom and Canada over what it called ""gross misconduct."" The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain accused Rockstar of union busting for laying off workers who were organizing with the union. Both sides have held firm since the initial accusations, and now the battle has gone to court in the UK. As reported by Video Games Chronicle , Rockstar and the IWGB went before the court earlier this week, where the latter requested that the fired workers be given ""interim relief"" while the legal drama plays out. If granted, that would place the affected workers back on Rockstar's payroll and allow some to keep their visas that were reliant on their jobs. The court will reportedly decide on the matter before the end of the week. The IWGB pledged to continue fighting for the workers regardless of the court's decision, while Rockstar reiterated its position that the workers broke the company's policy.

New Switch 2 Joy-Cons Are Here And They're Extremely Underwhelming,"Nintendo has revealed its first set of new Joy-Con controllers for the Nintendo Switch 2 and I'll be honest, I'm a bit disappointed. To be clear, I'm not disappointed (or surprised) by the $100 price tag, as the original Switch Joy-Cons are still $90, the standard Switch 2 Joy-Cons are $100, and all gaming hardware is pretty expensive right now. No, it's not the cost that bothers me, but rather how little these new Joy-Cons differentiate themselves from the pair that already exist. Similar to the original Switch's Joy-Cons, it appears that the various colorways for the Switch 2 versions will feature two different colors; in the case of these newly announced Joy-Cons, those colors are a bright, pastel purple and a vibrant aqua that the company refers to as ""Light Green."" Despite not fully agreeing with Nintendo on what constitutes light green, I actually really like these new colors. It took a long time for me to care for any of the original Switch's Joy-Con colorways enough to purchase them, as the vast majority are extremely saturated and don't feature color combinations that I feel pair well together. I was so starved for options, in fact, that I purchased the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch largely because I thought it featured the best Joy-Con colors available. In that sense, these new Joy-Cons definitely feel like an improvement. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"New GTA 6 Delay Rumor Shot Down By Reporter, Says Statement Was Misconstrued","Grand Theft Auto 6 is still a little over 10 months away, assuming its November 2026 release window holds. Earlier this week, GTA 6 watchers were unsettled when Bloomberg's Jason Schreier noted that the game might not be as ""content complete"" as Rockstar has said in the past, and he didn't rule out another delay. Some fans took that as if GTA 6 was already pushed back again, which is why Schreier has stepped forward to clarify his comments. During a recent appearance on the Button Mash podcast, Schreier said, ""The last I heard, [GTA 6] was still not content complete. That is to say people were still finishing things up, still finalizing levels, and missions, and seeing what is going to make it into the game."" He added that he doesn't ""think anyone at Rockstar can tell you, with 100% certainty, that they will make it out in November."" Schreier responded to reports based on his comments by reiterating that he ""wouldn't be shocked if GTA 6 'does' come out this fall, following the same delay pattern as [Red Dead Redemption 2]."" He also characterized some of the reports as, ""a complete misunderstanding of what I said."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Why Some Believe A Witcher 3 Expansion Is Coming Soon,"Near the end of 2024, CD Projekt Red put The Witcher 4 into full development with a release date potentially years away. Now, some outlets are putting forth theories that there may be a new Witcher 3 expansion to fill the gap between the present and the fourth game's release. IGN Poland and Eurogamer separately released stories suggesting that The Witcher 3 will get its first expansion since Blood and Wine was released in 2016. Eurogamer's report suggests that the drive to release something new this year is because CD Projekt Red is behind sales goals that would trigger financial incentives for its employees. That program has been mentioned by the company itself , which stated in a 2025 investor's call that, ""There is a chance that new content hinted upon in recent calls and reports may see release in the coming year, having an impact on our results and increasing the likelihood of achieving the earnings condition for the first stage of the incentive program.""

Nintendo Is Serving Up New Joy-Con 2 Controller Colors Just In Time For Mario Tennis Fever,"Nintendo Switch 2 Light Green and Light Purple Joy-Con 2 (2-Pack) $100 | Releases February 12 Preorder at Nintendo Store Nintendo has unveiled its first set of new Joy-Con 2 colors: Light Purple and Light Green . These add a pastel accent to the controllers, and preorders for the $100 set--the same price as a standard set of Light Blue and Light Red Joy-Con 2 controllers--are now open ahead of their February 12 launch. Both controllers also come with matching wrist straps. Nintendo Switch 2 Light Green and Light Purple Joy-Con 2 (2-Pack) $100 | Releases February 12 This isn't a complete makeover of the Joy-Con 2, as the new color appears on the base of the thumbstick and the included wrist strap. This means that the colors will be hard to spot, unless you use one of the Joy-Con 2 controllers on their own during a multiplayer game like Mario Kart World. The Joy-Con 2 controllers feature motion controls, improved HD Rumble, NFC support for Amiibo, and are slightly larger than the original Switch Joy-Cons. Mouse Mode is a new addition that lets you turn the controllers on their sides and use them like a computer mouse in compatible games like Metroid Prime 4, Fortnite, and Civilization 7. You'll also find the new C button to access the Switch 2's GameChat feature on the right Joy-Con 2, and the magnetic connection lets them snap firmly into place on the console. Preorder at Nintendo Store The controllers are also arriving just in time for Mario Tennis Fever, which will be released on the same day. Mario Tennis Fever's physical edition is up for preorder at Amazon , Walmart , Target , Best Buy , and GameStop . The game is also compatible with original Joy-Con controllers, and these are still readily available.

Like most things in life, these accessories saw their price increase last year. Nintendo raised the MSRP on most of its products by $5-$10 each. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Arc Raiders A Warm Place To Rest Quest Guide,"Arc Raiders sends you on a handful of quests seeking out evidence of survivors, including A Warm Place to Rest. In this quest, you'll have to find any signs that raiders have survived topside near the Abandoned Highway Camp in Buried City. We'll tell you everything you need to know about this quest and how to complete it in this guide. You don't need to extract to complete A Warm Place to Rest, but you will be trekking across the entire Buried City map to complete the objectives. With this in mind, a free loadout may not be your best bet, as you're rather likely to encounter raiders or ARC, which means you'll probably need extra healing items. It's your choice, of course, but we'd recommend bringing a decent gun or two, and enough heals to keep you trucking along safely. When you're ready to finish A Warm Place to Rest, follow the steps below. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Arc Raiders Communication Hideout Quest Guide,"Arc Raiders ' Buried City map is home to a lot of the game's most interesting quests, including Communication Hideout, which sends you to the Red Tower to complete various steps so that you can boot up an antenna. If you're setting out to check this one off your list, we've got every step listed out for you. You won't need to extract to finish this quest, so come in with a free loadout if you'd rather play it safe. Losing valuable items while questing is never fun, after all. That being said, there's some potentially good loot near the quest's Red Tower POI, such as the Santa Maria houses, so there's more to do in the area if you want to come better prepared. Either way, when you're ready to complete Communication Hideout, follow the steps below. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Arc Raiders Lost In Transmission Quest Guide,"Arc Raiders occasionally sends you on quests that require you to enter areas that require a key. One of these quests, Lost in Transmission, asks you to head up into Spaceport's Control Tower A6, where you'll need to establish a connection from a terminal there. We're here to guide you through each step of this short but potentially dangerous quest. There are two important things to note about this quest: You must bring the Spaceport Control Tower Key into the raid . You will be granted this key upon accepting the quest, and you will not be able to open the necessary door and reach the terminal without it. Place the key in a safe pocket to ensure it's not lost during any potential firefights you encounter. If you didn't bring it or have already lost it, there's a chance someone else will have opened the door, but otherwise you'll need to acquire a new key, which can be found randomly as loot on any map. Speaking of firefights, the locked room of Control Tower A6 tends to contain really good loot, so other raiders will often contest this location . If you're lucky, your visit to Control Tower A6 may end up quiet. But there's always a chance that you'll need to take someone out, so come prepared. When you're ready to tackle Lost in Transmission, follow the steps below. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
GameStop CEO Could Ring In Big Payday But With An Even Bigger Caveat,"GameStop announced this week that a proposed pay package worth approximately $35 billion for its CEO, Ryan Cohen, was in the works. The compensation is tied entirely to the company's performance and depends on a major turnaround. To earn it, Cohen must increase GameStop's market value by more than 10 times and significantly raise profits. Meeting these goals would require a big change for GameStop, which has struggled in recent years . Its stock price is also severely down from the record highs reached in 2021 , when GameStop gained popularity among retail investors during the meme-stock surge . Even at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, GameStop was already planning on matching the number of store closures from the previous year . Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Baby Waluigi Cries Waaaah In Mario Tennis Fever,"Nintendo has released a new overview trailer for Mario Tennis Fever, the upcoming sports game for Switch 2 . While the video goes over various modes and special rackets, the most important revelation is Baby Waluigi. He's a real playable character, and he's spectacular. Baby Waluigi, who we caught a brief glimpse of during the announcement trailer last year, isn't the only newcomer to Mario Tennis Fever, though. The game will feature Goomba, Nabbit, Piranha Plant, and Baby Wario for the first time as part of the playable cast, consisting of 38 characters overall. The sports title will also serve up 30 Fever Rackets. Nintendo showcased some of the special abilities tied to these frames, such as the Pokey Racket and Golden Dash Racket. The former spawns enemies on your opponent's court, while the latter can make your character super agile. Nintendo also detailed how to counter Fever shots. If players can volley the ball back--meaning not allowing it to bounce off the court--the special effect can be sent back. For instance, the Ice Racket creates a frozen surface on the court. Instead of this slippery area appearing on your side, you can volley the Fever shot back to your opponent. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Nintendo Switch 2 Sales Were Reportedly Not Amazing Over The Holidays,"The Nintendo Switch 2 was indisputably a sales hit after its June 2025 launch, but a new report indicates that the hybrid console's success may not match up to the original Switch's first holiday season. According to The Game Business , Switch 2 sales in the United States were down by around 35% from November to December compared to Switch 1 sales during the same period in its launch year of 2017. This statistic tracks with an earlier report from Circana revealing that November 2025 was the worst month for hardware sales in the US since 1995. The Switch 2 didn't fare much better in European countries, with UK sales having a reported fall of 16% compared to the Switch 1 in Holiday 2017. In France, Switch 2 unit numbers for its inaugural year are reportedly over 30% lower than what the Switch 1 achieved during its first year. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Razer Is Teasing A Collaboration With One Of The Biggest Mecha Anime Of All time,"The popular anime franchise Neon Genesis Evangelion has had several crossovers with the tech world over the last couple of years, and now Razer is teasing a collaboration with the IP. While it's light on details, the brief teaser does hint that Razer will dig deep into Evangelion's signature visual language for its collaboration. Razer | EVANGELION エヴァ2号機 コレクション がまもなく。 #RazerXEVANGELION pic.twitter.com/V8Bpo0m2L2 — R Λ Z Ξ R 🇯🇵 (@RazerJP) January 8, 2026 One of the remarkable things about Neon Genesis Evangelion has been its evergreen art direction. The various mecha, graphic design elements, and iconography of the series have stood the test of time since the show debuted in 1995, and have evolved over the years through the Rebuild of Evangelion anime movies. The series has inspired a line of PC gaming hardware from Asus, vibrant Nvidia graphics cards decked out in Evangelion symbols and text, Govee's popular line of Evangelion gaming lights , and the recently released Casio Evangelion watch, an eye-catching celebration of the anime's 30th anniversary. If it's anything like Razer's Pokemon collection that launched last year, you can probably expect to see gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets get an Evangelion makeover. Razer launched a Pokemon Edition of its Cobra Wired Gaming Mouse alongside a matching BlackWidow V4 X Mechanical Keyboard and other items, dressing the gear up in vibrant Pikachu yellow and Pokemon icons.

Cyberpunk 2077 Nintendo Switch 2 Physical Edition Gets First Discount,"Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition (Switch 2) $60 (was $70) See at Amazon The physical edition of one of the best third-party games for Nintendo Switch 2 is on sale for the first time at Amazon. Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition , which launched alongside the Switch 2 last June, is available for $60 (was $70). And unlike most third-party Switch 2 games, Cyberpunk 2077 comes with the full 60.6GB of game data on the card, so it won't consume 25% of your storage space like the digital edition. It is worth noting, however, that the digital version was recently available for $40 during the eShop Holiday Sale--though Switch 2 users who shopped during the first day of the sale only paid $17.49 due to a pricing error that was honored by CD Projekt Red. Unfortunately, the digital price is back up to $70. Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition (Switch 2) $60 (was $70) The Ultimate Edition comes with the base game and the excellent Phantom Liberty expansion that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2023. The Nintendo Switch 2 port of CD Projekt Red's beloved open-world action-RPG is exceedingly impressive. Naturally, it's not as visually stunning as it is on PS5 and Xbox Series X. In a showdown against the Steam Deck, however, the Switch 2 edition offers a better experience as a portable game. The graphics, animations, and overall picture clarity are impressive thanks to the Switch 2's DLSS upscaling tech, ray-tracing and HDR support, and VRR. You can pick between Quality and Performance Modes. In Quality Mode, Cyberpunk 2077 runs at a mostly smooth 30fps with 1080p resolution on handheld and docked. Performance Mode targets 40fps with 1080p resolution when docked and 720p resolution on the Switch 2's display. In handheld mode, Cyberpunk 2077 takes advantage of the screen's Variable Refresh Rate tech to maximize performance. Cyberpunk 2077 also supports Joy-Con 2 Mouse Mode as well as motion controls if you want to try gyroscope aiming while using the wide variety of weapons and abilities you uncover in Night City. And if you already have a save file on a different platform, the Switch 2 version supports cross-progression. See at Amazon CD Projekt Red's open-world RPG had an infamously poor launch back in 2020, but the studio gradually improved the experience over the next few years. The 2.0 update, which was implemented days before Phantom Liberty's launch, turned Cyberpunk 2077 from a pretty good game to an incredible one--and roughly 20-hour expansion is arguably the best piece of story content in the whole experience.

"AAA Games' Future ""Lies In Smaller Teams,"" Says AC Unity Director","The creative director of Assassin's Creed Unity and Assassin's Creed Revelations , Alexandre Amancio, hasn't been shy about his belief that AAA game development is broken. Although Amancio has since left Ubisoft to serve as a senior vice president at FunPlus, he does have ideas about the future of AAA games and he believes that smaller dev teams are the way to go. Amancio told GamesIndustry.biz that a lot of AAA studios ""think that you can solve a problem by throwing people at it. But adding people to a problem stagnates the people that were already being efficient on it. It just creates a lot of variable noise ... So I think the future lies in smaller teams."" As an example of how smaller teams can collaborate on bigger projects, Amancio used Assassin's Creed: Black Flag as a hypothetical example. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

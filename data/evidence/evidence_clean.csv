Reanimal review,"It's impossible to talk about Reanimal without talking about Little Nightmares . Developer Tarsier's first game since departing the series that put it on the map (part three was handled elsewhere with middling results ) is so Little Nightmares coded it's difficult to ignore. This is a game of two spindly limbed moppets, Boy and Girl, lost in a hellish, hostile world. Play is structured around recurring boss characters and inevitable crescendo pursuits. And Reanimal even shares many of its predecessor's affectations, from the enigmatic opening tease - here the mouldering mouth of a well opening onto a threatening sky - to the way our precocious protagonists return from death huddled together, as if woken from a premonitory dream.

Wolfenstein 3 Can’t Pull Its Punches Like Youngblood,"Wolfenstein: Youngblood was one sour batch of sauerkraut. Marinated in a noxious and ill-fitting live-service-adjacent brine, this troubled spin-off (and the mediocre virtual reality title it launched alongside) left a bad taste that has lingered for almost seven years. Developer MachineGames’ adventures with another famous Nazi-killer and increasingly longer AAA development cycles have meant Youngblood’s aftertaste has stuck around longer than it should have. This drought is reportedly almost over, though, since reports forecast the streets will once again run red with Nazi blood sometime soon in a new Wolfenstein game, further backing up light teases from the MachineGames team itself. There’s a lot riding on Wolfenstein 3: a game that has to meet the moment in more ways than one--and can’t follow in Youngblood’s footsteps. Wolfenstein: Youngblood is the fourth entry in MachineGames’ alt-history Wolfenstein series and sets the franchise in the 1980s. But instead of controlling longtime series hero B.J. Blazkowicz in a single-player adventure, Youngblood puts players in the power armor of his twin daughters, Jess and Zofia, and, to its downfall, focuses more on co-op and RPG mechanics.

Logan Paul Sells Pikachu Illustrator Card For A Record Breaking $16.59 Million,"Logan Paul has sold his ultra-rare Pikachu Illustrator card for a record-breaking $16.59 million at auction. WWE wrestler and YouTuber Paul bought the card for $5.275 million in 2021, which broke the standing record at the time.

"Highguard Appears Ready To Say Bye-Guard, Players Believe","It's been a tumultuous road for Highguard and its developer Wildlight Entertainment, and a couple of abnormalities online have observers believe the online first-person shooter is not long for this world. Less than a week after layoffs at Wildlight, the official Highguard website went offline, eliciting speculation that it's the end of the road for the game. The Highguard website currently displays a ""Site Unavailable"" message and a support email address to Code32, a hosting service specifically for video game websites. The error page also contains links to the game's official X account and an invite to the game's Discord server. As observed by Reddit users , the Discord button erroneously led to an unrelated server for a similarly named ""High Guard Gaming Guild"" before it was fixed at some point. While it's possible that the website's downtime is due to a hosting issue, the silence from Wildlight has players concluding that the studio has called it quits on the game after a mixed reception and faltering player numbers.

"Thanks To A Gaffe, You Can Get Extra Magic: The Gathering Promo Cards","Last month, Magic: The Gathering players arriving at their local game stores to participate in Lorwyn Eclipsed prerelease events were shocked to find that rares and mythics from the next expansion, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , wound up in their prerelease kits. Wizards of the Coast acknowledged the issue at the time, poked fun at the mishap with a video from new mascots Squen and Cragg, and today the company has announced its make-good: free extra promo cards during an upcoming TMNT event.

Battlefield 6 Devs Reportedly Betting Big On Season 2 Comeback Following Declining Numbers,"Battlefield 6 launched on top of the world back in October 2025, peaking on Steam at more than 747,000 players, but the months since then have been a little unkind to the game. Since its release, player numbers have dropped, and it seems the developers are well aware that the delayed second season needs to hit harder than the first to keep players engaged. GameRant reported that CharlieIntel, in a since deleted post on Twitter, shared a quote from an unnamed developer on Battlefield 6 saying, ""Now the trailer has dropped, the roadmap has dropped, we're all sitting in our chairs biting our nails a little bit."" The sentiment suggests that the team is well aware of the pressure to recapture even a fraction of the the audience that it landed right out of the gate. Fans of Battlefield 6 quickly blew through all of its maps, modes, and battle pass at launch before subsequently voicing their frustrations with the game's technical problems and content. In particular, players have seemed constantly vexed at the game's lack of map variety, both in terms of sheer numbers and structural differences--many have voiced a desire for bigger maps.

"Warner Bros. Reopens Talks With Paramount, Sets Date For Netflix-Sale Vote","The ongoing saga of the Warner Bros. sale isn't over yet, as the studio has agreed to reopen negotiations with Paramount. Netflix--Warner Bros. Discovery's preferred suitor--granted a seven-day period for the latter to talk with Paramount about its revised offer for the entire company. In December 2025, Netflix unveiled a $82.7 billion bid for Warner Bros., jilting Paramount in the process. Subsequently, Paramount launched a hostile takeover bid and offered $108.4 billion. Warner Bros. has consistently rejected Paramount's offer, even when the terms have appeared to be more favorable for WBD than Netflix's. Contractually, Warner Bros. needed to get Netflix's permission to even entertain the idea of reopening negotiations with another bidder. In a statement, WBD noted that this new round of discussions will center on Paramount's ""best and final offer,"" in addition to proposed terms that the studio feels are deficient compared to Netflix's offer.

Highguard Attracted More Than 1.5 Million Players In January,"In just a matter of weeks, the raid shooter Highguard has gone from making a big splash to a cautionary tale on par with Sony's Concord .

Crimson Desert Will Not Feature Microtransactions When It Launches Next Month,"Pearl Abyss has confirmed that Crimson Desert will not feature any microtransactions when it launches on March 19 outside of its preorder bonuses. The company's PR and marketing director Will Powers said as much during a podcast interview with Dropped Frames ( via GamesRadar ).

"Switch 2 Price Hike Could Happen, Nintendo President Warns--But Only If This Occurs","Could the Switch 2 follow the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S platforms and get its own price hike in 2026? That's the belief of multiple experts, and Nintendo isn't ruling anything out. During the company's latest earnings briefing , Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said the ""recent rise in memory prices"" did not have much of an impact on the Switch 2's profitability for the latest quarter, and it's not expected to for the current one, but if the costs keep going up, Nintendo might pass that along to consumers in the form of a price hike. Or it might not. Nothing has been decided as of yet. ""If this rise in component prices lasts longer than expected and runs through the next fiscal year and beyond, it may put pressure on profitability,"" he said. ""If the situation deteriorates significantly, we will carefully assess market trends and respond. As for any future change in the price of Nintendo Switch 2 hardware, no decision has been made at this time. Any decision to change the price will be determined comprehensively, taking into consideration not only profitability, but also other factors like the platform's installed base, sales trends, and the market environment.""

Pikachu Is Basically A Ghost In Pokemon Pokopia,"It's official: Pikachu is dead. Or at least that's how it looks, as Pokemon Pokopia will introduce a new variant of Pikachu that has a ghostly shimmer to it. The first Pikachu variant in 25 years and designed by Game Freak--Pokemon Pokopia is co-developed by Koei Tecmo--this version of the electric rat is officially known as Peakychu. Speaking to Famitsu (via GamesRadar ), Koei Tecmo chief director Takuto Edagawa said that Peakychu was given the nickname ""unfortunate Pikachu"" internally, reflecting its ethereal appearance. In the game, Peakychu is unusually pale, has a smaller tail when compared to fellow Pikachu, droopy ears, and emits a strange glow from her body. ""In particular, Pikachu (Peakychu)'s temporal and melancholy feel is impressive. Internally, we called it Unfortunate Pikachu,"" Edagawa said. Draw your own conclusions from that. While Peakychu probably isn't dead, it certainly looks like you'll need to borrow a trap from the Ghostbusters to catch one. It's one of several new Pokemon variants being introduced in Pokemon Pokopia, with the list so far including a moss-covered Snorlax called Mosslax, a messy Smeargle called Smearguru, and Professor Tangrowth, a guide to the game's Ditto who has disguised itself as a human.

High On Life 2 Mocks Game Pass Players In A Very On-Brand Joke,"High on Life 2 is now out, and if you're looking to play the sequel to the 2022 original, you've got a few options. Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, the Squanch Games-developed title is also a day-one release through Xbox Game Pass, making it relatively easy to download and play if you're a subscriber. High on Life 2's developers haven't missed an opportunity to poke fun at this partnership between Squanch Games and Microsoft, as in-game personal assistant Suit-O has a few choice words for anyone who opted to grab the sequel through a ""game service."" ""You paid for the game, you might as well play all of it. Or did you get it for free with some deal? One of those game services, huh? I bet you're playing it on one of those game services,"" Suit-O says at one point. ""That's money out of pockets, I'll have you know. I mean, yeah, they pay us a lot to put it on those things, like millions, sometimes. But still! Think about how much more money we'd make if everyone bought it too! We could make a third game or something else entirely! What if we made Half-Life 3?"" Of course, there are several factors to consider here. How much Squanch Games was paid to make High on Life 2 a day-one launch title for Game Pass isn't public knowledge, and in terms of consoles, there's a far larger market on PS5 when compared to Xbox Series X|S console owners and Game Pass subscribers . PS5 is also the primary platform for High on Life 2 , according to Squanch Games CEO Mike Fridley. The original High on Life was released as a timed Xbox Series X|S console exclusive in December 2022, and it eventually landed on PS5 and PS4 consoles seven months later.

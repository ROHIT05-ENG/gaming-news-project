The NBA Jam Deluxe Arcade Cabinet is on sale for an all-time low price of $400 (was $500) at Amazon and Best Buy . The $100 discount is one of several notable last-minute holiday deals on Arcade1Up machines . We've included a list of the other Arcade1Up deals at the bottom of this story. Arcade1Up NBA Jam Deluxe Cabinet $400 (was $500) The NBA Jam Deluxe Cabinet is preloaded with three classic arcade basketball games developed by Midway from 1993-1996: NBA Jam, NBA Jam Tournament Edition, and NBA Hangtime. The control deck has two sets of inputs: one arcade stick and three buttons for each player. In addition to local multiplayer, you can play against users around the world over Wi-Fi. Like other Deluxe editions from Arcade1Up, it has a 17-inch HD display, light-up marquee, dual stereo speakers, and a faux coin door on the front.

See at Amazon See at Best Buy NBA Jam debuted exclusively in arcades in 1993 and was ported to consoles the following year. The Tournament Edition, which launched in 1994, is essentially an updated and expanded version of the original NBA Jam. As the name suggests, the main addition was Tournament mode. It's still 2v2 basketball, but Midway added a third player to each team, allowing you to make substitutions throughout each game. The Tournament Edition also expanded player stat categories. NBA Hangtime was developed by the same team at Midway, just with a different title because the NBA Jam moniker was sold to Acclaim Entertainment. Midway once again expanded the rosters to five players and introduced a custom player creator, but NBA Hangtime is still very much an NBA Jam game. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"Nex Playground Boss Says The Console Solves The Wii ""Problem""","While Sony and Nintendo have expanded their lead over Xbox, a dark horse console had a very strong showing in third place in November. The Nex Playground has emerged as a breakout hit, and CEO David Lee believes that one of the reasons why its been so successful is because the console has solved the Wii ""problem."" Nearly two decades ago, the Wii powered Nintendo's post-GameCube comeback with its motion controls and unique games. Lee argues that the scope of Wii's success made it difficult to sustain in the long term. Instead of trying to sell games like Wii, Nex Playground is offering its titles as part of a subscription service. ""One of the most important things we should do is learn from history and try not to commit the same limitations, and that's why we have a subscription model,"" Lee told The Game Business . ""Nintendo expanded the audience with Wii. When you expand the audience, and they want different things, and they only buy Wii Fit, Wii Sports and not many others … that's a bit of a problem.""

Save Up To 25% On The Akira Manga Hardcover Edition,"Akira Hardcover Collection Save Up To 25% See all volumes at Amazon Any list gathering up the best that anime has to offer will inevitably include Akira, and for good reason. The 1988 movie raised the bar for film animation and is widely credited with introducing mainstream audiences outside Japan to the medium. However, the anime adaptation is only part of the tale. Like innumerable other anime projects, Akira is adapted from a much longer--though lesser-known--manga series. While the Akira manga has been available in print for decades, a new Akira Hardcover Edition kicked off earlier in 2025, offering the most authentic presentation of Katsuhiro Otomo's groundbreaking sci-fi saga. If you've ever wanted to experience the full Akira saga, this is one of the best ways to do so--and as luck would have it, you can save a few dollars on these premium hardcover releases. Four volumes in the six-volume series are available to purchase at Amazon , and while these normally cost between $30 and $40, you can get them for up 25% off. Volumes 5 and 6 are also launching in the coming weeks , and preorders are live. Akira Hardcover Collection Save Up To 25% The Akira Hardcover books published by Kodansha use the updated translation and lettering of the 35th Anniversary Edition box set, and each book is presented as a large-sized 7"" x 10"" collectible. Like traditional manga, they are read from right to left, and the original Japanese-language hand-drawn sound effects from the manga have been restored. Each hardcover book has cover artwork based on the original manga tankabon volume artwork. As mentioned above, four volumes have launched so far, and are currently discounted to roughly $26 - $27 at Amazon (normally $30 - $35 each). The next release, Akira Hardcover Collection 5, releases on December 23. Preorders are discounted to $34 (down from $36).

All six volumes come bundled together with the hardcover Akira Club art book and an exclusive pill patch. It's currently sold out, but it gets restocked periodically at Amazon, so it's worth checking back to see if it's available. Set in a dark future timeline, Akira first began publication in 1982 and ran for 120 chapters. Taking place in the post-apocalyptic city of Neo-Tokyo, the series examines the after-effects of a mysterious explosion that almost destroyed the city. Thirty years later, teenage biker gang leader Shotaro Kaneda finds himself in the middle of a plot that involves militant revolutionaries, psychically gifted individuals, military forces, and his childhood friend, Tetsuo Shima, who has begun to develop dangerously destructive psychic powers of his own. Akira manga was critically acclaimed for its mature themes, well-developed characters, intriguing storylines, and Otomo's artwork. In the years since its publication, it's become regarded as one of the pioneering works in the then-burgeoning Cyberpunk sci-fi subgenre. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Amazon Lightning Deal: Donkey Kong Bananza Amiibo Gets Big Price Cut,"Donkey Kong and Pauline Amiibo $20 (was $30) Get deal at Amazon Donkey Kong fans can grab the Donkey Kong Bananza Amiibo for $20 (was $30) at Amazon right now. This is a Lightning Deal with limited quantities. At the time of writing, over 20% of the available Donkey Kong and Pauline Amiibo figures have been claimed. Amazon also has deals on two Amiibo figures that launched alongside the Nintendo Switch 2: Yunobo from The Legend of Zelda and Jamie from Street Fighter 6 are available for $8 each. Meanwhile, GameStop has all seven Switch 2 Amiibo launch figures for $6 each. The Legend of Zelda: Yunobo Amiibo -- $8 ( $30 ) Street Fighter 6: Jamie Amiibo -- $8 ( $40 ) Donkey Kong Bananza: Donkey Kong and Pauline -- $20 ( $30 ) Donkey Kong and Pauline Amiibo $20 (was $30) Based on DK's wide smile, we imagine he's punching his way to a Banandium Gem. He's also moving fast because Pauline's legs are dangling in the air. The uneven ground beneath DK's feet aligns with rocky terrain found in Ingot Isle, Lagoon Layer, and other locales from the game. As for its functionality in the game, scanning the Donkey Kong and Pauline Amiibo grants two main perks. You can unlock Pauline's Diva Dress a lot earlier in your adventure with the Amiibo. The Diva Dress doubles the likelihood of enemies dropping music discs. To unlock the Diva Dress, you need to talk to the NPC shaped like the Amiibo in the Resort Layer. The NPC will ask you to show them the Amiibo to claim your reward. Without the Amiibo, this particular outfit is locked behind post-game challenges. Scanning the Bananza Amiibo also spawns gold KONG letters that can be smashed to refill Bananergy. KONG tiles can also be spawned by scanning older Donkey Kong Amiibo figures. Get deal at Amazon Nintendo Switch 2 Amiibo Deals at GameStop As mentioned, GameStop is selling all four The Legend of Zelda Switch 2 Amiibo, the three Street Fighter 6 Amiibo, and the Street Fighter 6 Amiibo Card Starter Set for only $6 each as part of its last-minute holiday sale.

Rool Amiibo (Donkey Kong) $18 (was $20) Preorder at Best Buy Most Amiibo figures featuring Donkey Kong characters are out of print, but King K. Rool received a Best Buy-exclusive reprint in September. Normally $20, Best Buy is selling the figure for $18. King K. Rool is the priciest preowned Amiibo in the series sold at GameStop, so fans who are interested in adding King K. Rool to their collection should snag one from Best Buy sooner rather than later. GameStop has two older Donkey Kong Amiibo for $18 each and two Diddy Kong Amiibo for $20 each. Amazon also has the Smash Bros. Series Donkey Kong Amiibo for $20 , which would be its MSRP if reprinted today. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Nintendo Might Change The Switch 2 Feature Players Complain About Most,"A sizeable portion of Nintendo Switch 2 players have been very vocal about their opposition to Game-Key Cards that allow players to digitally download a game rather than including it on a cartridge.

Starfield's Second DLC Reportedly Pushed Back Because Of GTA 6 Delay,"It's lonely out in space, especially if you're a Starfield player waiting for any word about the next major update coming to the game. Bethesda's space-based game will receive an additional story DLC , it's just a matter of when. Now, a new report suggests that the delay of Grand Theft Auto 6 played a role in Bethesda's decision to push back its next Starfield chapter. According to Windows Central , Bethesda ""felt more comfortable"" about pushing Starfield's second DLC to the first half of 2026 because Microsoft already had a ""busy holiday period"" for 2025 without it. More intriguingly, the same report indicates that Bethesda has already been showing off the new update and DLC behind closed doors to a select group of players. One of the rumored changes is a revamp of the game's space flight systems that will actually make travel feel like a journey instead of a series of loading screens. Other aspects of space travel and exploration are also said to be improved in the new update, and the Creation Engine will reportedly include ""large technical improvements ... that will also carry forward to future games.""

"Witcher 4 Dev Is Says AI Can Unlock ""Meaningful"" Benefits","The Witcher and Cyberpunk developer CD Projekt Red is the latest company to sound off on the use of AI in gaming. During CD Projekt Red's latest earnings briefing, Joint CEO Michał Nowakowski said there are ""meaningful"" and ""real"" benefits to using the technology. The company is already implementing such technologies ""mainly in the productivity areas"" and so far that's where the ""largest benefits"" have stemmed from, he explained , as reported by GamesRadar. A developer won't be able to use AI to make an entire game, though, and humans will remain essential to the process, he said. ""The benefits are real, they’re meaningful; but it's not a situation--and I'm unaware of such a situation--where AI could 'sit down and make games.' That's our take. It doesn't mean it's not gonna be useful, but it's not gonna be making The Witcher 5, or 6, or anything like that,"" Nowakowski explained. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Fortnite Responds To The Grinch Hating On The Game,"Christmas is around the corner and one of Universal Studios' biggest attractions is the meet-and-greet with The Grinch. Meeting Whoville's Christmas curmudgeon can take up to over five hours with the lines, but with social interactions going viral, it's hard not to resist a photo and a few minutes with the beloved monster.

Innocent enough, but in the typical Grinch way, he turned sour on the game, saying it got boring and needed him to be in it. ""I used to, but then it got boring. Very boring. But I know they're always releasing new skins and characters. I heard that [Marty] McFly guy is in there now. I heard Eminem was in there--there's a bunch of new things.

"Switch 2 Game Ditches Game-Key Cards For A Physical Release, But It'll Cost More","Game-Key Cards have been divisive since they were first introduced, but the good news is that the full R-Type Dimensions 3 game will be on the Switch 2 cartridge. The bad news? You're going to have to pay a little bit extra for that side-scrolling shoot-'em-up, as the price is going up to €70. It's worth noting that those who already preordered the physical Special Edition will not see their price change. Publisher Inin Games had previously explained that switching the entire run to standard cartridges would have resulted in manufacturing costs increasing by ""at least"" €15 per game copy, which is why it chose the Game-Key Card option. Inin Games pledged to look for a way to release the full game on a Switch cartridge, leading to today's news about the costs increasing, but not as much as it anticipated.

Until, that is, dark forces (Eurogamer editor-in-chief Tom Orry) conspired to nudge it into my orbit. And having now played a good few hours of Code Vein 2 over this last week, I'm both surprised and delighted to discover I'm having a lovely time. Read more"

"After one final extensive hands-on, Resident Evil: Requiem's formula mash-up has me utterly convinced","Resident Evil 9 (aka Requiem) is all about the swings.

This Resident Evil Requiem Live-Action Trailer Might Be Better Than Any Resident Evil Movie,"The Resident Evil franchise has a mixed track record in the cinematic landscape, and a new live-action short film promoting Resident Evil Requiem may put all previous efforts to shame.

In a new blog post , the publisher says its top priority is ""launching Ranked Play with the strongest protections possible"" to ensure matches are decided by player skill and not exploits.

Classic Edutainment Series Freddi Fish Getting A Remastered Collection On Console,"Freddi Fish Collection $50 | Releases April 17 Preorder at Amazon As far as children's video games are concerned, few are as iconic as Freddi Fish. First launched in 1994, the point-and-click adventure game challenges players to solve puzzles and mysteries, featuring a colorful cast of characters and charming animations. The games were incredibly popular when they first hit the market, and you (and your kids) can relive the glory days with the upcoming Freddi Fish Collection . Currently available on most digital storefronts, the Freddi Fish Collection is getting a physical Switch and PS5 release on April 17. Freddi Fish Collection $50 | Releases April 17 Freddi and friends went on five adventures between 1994 and 2001, and this bundle pulls them all together into a single collection. Here's a look at what you'll find: Freddi Fish: The Case of the Missing Kelp Seeds Freddi Fish 2: The Case of The Haunted Schoolhouse Freddi Fish 3: The Case of the Stolen Conch Shell Freddi Fish 4: The Case of The Hogfish Rustlers of Briny Gulch Freddi Fish 5: The Case of the Creature of Coral Cove These are all faithful recreations of the classics, with voice acting, a catchy soundtrack, and an old-school animation style. Limited Run Games was previously offering a bundle that pulled together this Freddi Fish Collection plus an official soundtrack, though it has already sold out. These physical copies at Amazon are likely to be just as popular.

Be sure you double-check the listed platform to ensure you're grabbing the right one. Preorder at Amazon If you want to add another kid-friendly game to your collection, check out Snoopy & The Great Mystery Club . Currently on sale for $35 (was $40), it has you teaming up with the entire Peanuts cast as you trek around town and solve a variety of mysteries. For something a bit more energetic, Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled is just $24 (was $40) on Switch. It offers tons of customization options if you really want to tinker with your build, but even young players should be able to have some fun flying around its tracks. Other choices include Hot Wheels Let's Race: Ultimate Speed for $30 (was $40), Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 for $30 (was $60), and Bluey: The Videogame for $18 (was $40). The Hot Wheels game gets you racing action similar to CTR, while Mario & Sonic might be a good choice since the Winter Olympics are right around the corner. Keep in mind that you'll be competing in summer events like track and field, not winter ones like hockey--but the accessible mini-games are great for kids of all ages.

Youtuber Ocelot has gone through seven different versions of Half-Life 2, poring over each detail from the game's opening to Black Mesa East. The video starts by looking at the original PC build from 2004, which isn't the version you'll find on Steam today. That version, released in 2024 to commemorate the game's 20th anniversary, makes some significant visual enhancements to trick your brain into thinking Half-Life 2 has aged considerably better than you think. And while that's still true, it's remarkable to see how small, meaningful changes make a big impact. Curiously, it's also fascinating to see how much the current PC version has in common with the considerably older Xbox 360 and PS3 ports, down to peculiar bugs and visual oddities that exist across all three. Perhaps the most noticeable concerns the ominous opening with G-Man, and in particular the glow to his green eyes. This isn't present in the original or the 20th anniversary edition, and is subjectively better in its ""bugged"" state in The Orange Box port. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
New MMORPG Ashes Of Creation In Turmoil Amid Staff Resignation And Layoff Warnings,"Things appear to be in shambles at the California-based developer Intrepid Studios. Game director Steven Sharif resigned at the end of January ""in protest"" of the company's management board, which led to several other senior staff members quitting and leaving the developer's ambitious MMORPG, Ashes of Creation , in turmoil. Funded through a combination of Kickstarter backing (to the tune of $3.2 million) and Sharif's personal investment in 2017, Ashes of Creation is described as an ""old-school take on the modern MMORPG set in a living, reactive world where your choices shape civilization."" It was in a lengthy alpha phase before launching in early access via Steam on December 11 for a discounted $50. Now, however, the game and its studio are experiencing some tough turbulence. On January 31, game director Steven Sharif announced his resignation in Discord ( via PCGamesN ) as a result of the management board's decisions that he felt he ""could not ethically agree with or carry out."" ""I can make a limited statement in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the company, regarding the situation,"" Sharif wrote. ""Control of the company shifted away from me, and the Board began directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out. As a result, I chose to resign in protest rather than lend my name or authority to decisions I could not ethically support. Following my resignation, much of the senior leadership team resigned. Following those departures, the Board made the decision to issue WARN Act notices and proceed with a mass layoff."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Helldivers 2 Found Its Leading Face Faster Than You'd Expect,"Helldivers 2 's introductory cinematic/slick propaganda is arguably its best recruitment tool. Within minutes, the sight of an idyllic lifestyle being torn apart by a rampaging Terminid makes you want to sign up to bring Managed Democracy to the far-flung corners of the galaxy. Thanks in part to the motion-captured performance of actor Craig Lee Thomas--better known to the fanbase as John Helldiver--the game sets its tone and stakes quickly, and it's one that came about at the eleventh hour as Arrowhead revealed more details on how the iconic cinematic was created. As part of the two-year anniversary for Helldivers 2, Arrowhead has released a new ""Dev Tales"" video that features behind-the-scenes content. Former Helldivers 2 lead writer Russ Nickel explained how he was contacted a week before the scene was meant to be shot, with animation studio Goodbye Kansas having a completely different actor in mind for John Helldiver. ""They actually hadn't really done any casting,"" Nickel explained. ""They were just going to use this actor who's based in Sweden--who was perfectly good--but I was like, this is going to be John Helldiver! We can't just get someone who's good, like, we need to get the funniest person we can possibly find."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"

EA's Super Bowl 60 Simulation Predicts A Wild Game With A Last-Second Finish,"EA Sports has released the results of its annual Super Bowl simulation using Madden, and this year, the simulation predicted that the Seattle Seahawks will beat the New England Patriots by a score of 23-20 in Super Bowl LX. The game will come down to the very last play, according to the simulation, but the Seahawks will ultimately get it done and avoid losing at the last-second to the Patriots again like they did at Super Bowl XLIX 2015. Seahawks QB Sam Darnold will be named Super Bowl LX MVP, according to the simulation. EA's simulation has accurately predicted the past two Super Bowl winners, as it chose the Kansas City Chiefs to win Super Bowl LVIII and the Philadelphia Eagles to win Super Bowl LIX.

"Dispatch Dev Admits ""People Have A Right To Be Pissed"" About Switch 2 Launch","The fallout continues from Dispatch launching in a censored state on Switch and Switch 2 last week. While developer AdHoc Studio initially implied this issue was because of the platform holder, Nintendo responded that it ""does not make changes to partner content."" Now, AdHoc is admitting that ""people have a right to be pissed"" and is hoping to release an update for the game ""to address at least some of the censored content."" Eurogamer received a new statement from AdHoc about why nudity was covered up on Switch and Switch 2--along with changes to other sexual content. ""We initially assumed, like some of you, that because games like Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk [2077] are on the platform with similar types of uncensored mature content, Dispatch would be allowed to do the same,"" AdHoc said. ""During the porting process, it became clear that was not the case."" AdHoc added that ""it was our intent to go out of our way to tell people looking to buy the game that the content was censored."" The Dispatch developer explained that the disclaimer about the censored content should have been more prominent on the eShop store page for the game. ""Wires got crossed, and we put the disclaimer in the field literally titled 'Disclaimer' instead of the 'About The Game' section,"" AdHoc said. This created a situation where the PSA was put in ""the absolute worst spot that makes it look like we were trying to hide it,"" according to the developer. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Nioh 3 May Land On Other Consoles After PC And PS5, New Trailer Shows","Nioh fans hoping the latest entry would arrive on more than just PC and PlayStation 5 may be in luck, as the game's latest trailer suggests that it could arrive on other platforms just six months after its launch later this week. According to a features trailer posted to PlayStation's official YouTube channel on January 29, Team Ninja's upcoming souls-like will be allowed to release on other platforms six months after its PC and PS5 debut on February 6. The language is quite specific: ""[ Nioh 3 will not be] available on other consoles until at least [six] months after February 6, 2026."" This means the latest souls-like action-RPG from the Japanese developer could land on Xbox--and maybe even Nintendo--consoles as soon as August 2026. If you remember the previous entries in the franchise--2017's Nioh and 2020's Nioh 2 --neither came to any other platform, staying locked to both PC and PlayStation consoles for the duration of their releases (and even to this day).

This Jet Fighter Game Is Being Built For Players Who Want To Show Off,"It's a scientific fact that two of the coolest things in life are military fighter jets and the Devil May Cry franchise. So what happens when you smash the two together? You get Delivery Must Complete , a ""high-speed Acelike Roguelike with SSStyle"" created by Australia-based developer Yoyoyollie. Revealed last year, Delivery Must Complete is what happens when a sidewinder missile locks onto the laws of physics and promptly blows it out of discussion, leaving behind a game where every fight is a spectacle and the sky truly is the limit. The Steam page explains that you really will need to make a delivery via a fighter jet express courier service, but in the middle of an aerial warzone. Fortunately, blimps, dragons, and mechs are no match for an ace pilot who can tear across the sky, powerslide out of harm's way, and parry missiles. Every map is procedurally generated, with weather changes, varying cloud cover, terrain anomalies, and random map events that add variety to each zone. Since revealing the project, Yoyoyollie has been joined by sound designer Jonathan Foe and Project Wingman composer Jose Pavli. Speaking to GameSpot, Yoyoyollie revealed that a wide range of influences had inspired the design of Delivery Must Complete--like Ace Combat, Project Wingman, Devil May Cry, Ultrakill, Afterburner, Sephiria, and Bomb Rush Cyberfunk. The game's cel-shaded look was born of Yoyoyollie's desire not to be bogged down by the time-consuming pursuit of realistic graphics, and because the cel-shaded design was refreshingly different.

Fallout Episode 7 Raised The Stakes For The Finale,"Fallout Season 2's penultimate entry, Episode 7, puts all the chips are on the table. While Lucy (Ella Purnell) is with Hank (Kyle Maclaclan) in the Vault-Tec executive bunker, The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) finally partied up with Maximus (Aaaron Moten) and Thaddeus (Johnny Pemberton) in the wake of the chaos at Area 51. Meanwhile, Norm (Moises Arias) discovered that Vault 33 is set to be used for an experiment involving the “Forced Evolutionary Virus” and Overseer Stephanie (Annabel O’Hagan) struggles with her authoritarian rule over Vault 32 while prepping for her wedding to the unwilling Chet (Dave Register). With the odds stacked against all of our main players, can someone take the jackpot, or does the house always win? The episode opens up with a pre-war flashback on the Canadian border. Now a territory of the United States, two prisoners manage to escape an internment camp and run through the woods toward the border. The prisoners are revealed to be Stephanie and her mother, fighting for a better life than the one they have as prisoners in Canada. As they near the border, they’re stopped by a Marine in USMC Power Armor. Hope seems lost for a brief moment, until another prisoner appears, and turns out to be a suicide bomber--killing the Marine in the resulting blast. While Stephanie and her mother manage to get away, her mother is injured from the explosion and, as she dies, motivates Stephanie to make it to the border by any means needed, even if it means killing innocent people. As Stephanie crosses the border into the United States, she’s stopped by a Border Patrol guard and prepares for her first kill. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Markplier's Iron Lung Movie Is Already A Box Office Hit After A Single Weekend,"Youtuber Mark ""Markiplier"" Fischbach's feature film adaptation of the horror video game Iron Lung has gotten off to an impressive start at the box office, earning $21.5 million globally.

It's really cool because everybody wins,"" Fischbach said. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

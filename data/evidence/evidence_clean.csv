It's singular enough, in fact, that it's not an easy thing to effectively describe, but if you can imagine a sort of thematic reinterpretation of Animal Farm by way of Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salo on one side, and a meme-able Garry's Mod video on the other, then Horses gleefully oscillates between them, landing somewhere in the middle.

Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's chatty space marine companions aren't so bad - it's Samus who is this game's narrative problem,"As Metroid Prime 4: Beyond hits storefronts, I'm pretty sure you're going to see a whole lot of fevered debate online about the game's curious choice to place Samus, famously quiet Bounty Hunter, as the de facto head of a squad of Galactic Federation soldiers.

Metroid Prime 4: Beyond review,"Taken as a whole, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond feels like something of a composite. On one hand, it is clearly a follow-up to 2007's Metroid Prime 3: Corruption , drawing close many of that game's greatest triumphs and fumbles with a fascinating reverence. On the other, it is something new for the series, structurally most comparable not to other Metroid games but rather to a different Nintendo adventure franchise (more on that shortly). Then there is how the game is built, feeling almost modular, with different modes and moods of play stitched together with visible seams. With all that said, it certainly - at least broadly - works rather well. Read more"

The trio of thieves were captured on camera in KTLA 5's video report below. Store owner Kiet Nguyen noted that the thieves seemed to know just where to go to get the most valuable Pokemon cards in the store.

Additionally, the thieves stole rare sports cards that featured Mickey Mantle and Ronaldo among others. The thieves were in and out of the store in around three minutes, and the report notes that this trio may have hit other card shops in Southern California.

Codenamed ""Juliet"" in the files, the project was a modern remake of the iconic 2004 RPG and was in development alongside the KOTOR remake , which developer Saber Interactive said is still coming . However, per Game File and unlike the KOTOR remake, development on the KOTOR II remake has ceased as recently as March 2025.

""'Juliet' was the codename for a project where we were going to do a full remake of KOTOR II,"" Reilly said.

"Future Assassin's Creed Games Could Have Multiple Protagonists, Says AC Shadows Dev","Ubisoft has yet to share its plans for future Assassin's Creed games beyond Assassin's Creed Shadows , but that title's dual-protagonist setup with Yasuke and Naoe may not be the last time players get to have multiple characters to choose from. ""I think the learning for us is that, yes, we could do more dual-protagonist games in the future--if we have a good reason to do it narratively and for the setting,"" said Assassin's Creed Shadows associate director Simon Lemay-Comtois while speaking with GamesRadar . Yasuke and Noae weren't the first dual protagonists in an Assassin's Creed game. Twins Jacob and Evie were featured in Assassin's Creed Syndicate.

"Microsoft Initially Rejected Idea To Bring Flight Simulator To PS5, Dev Says","Microsoft originally rejected a pitch to bring Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 to PlayStation consoles, but the company eventually agreed, and this led to a ""whole avalanche"" of Xbox games on PlayStation. That's according to Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator Jorg Neumann. He told XDA-Developers that it was his own idea to bring Flight Simulator to PlayStation consoles, culminating with the launch of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 today, December 8, on PS4 and PS5. The 2020 Flight Simulator game eventually grew to become 300 GB in size, and there was so much content planned that Neumann said the game could grow to become 1 TB. So instead of doing that, the team made a new game, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and the game now only has 8 GB of space for a requirement, with everything else sent to the cloud. This way of packaging the game allowed the game to come to other platforms, Neumann said. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

""Me and Tetsuya Nomura have already narrowed it down to two, within the year we will decide on which one.

Shenmue Studio Considering Legal Action Over Fake Shenmue 4 Trailer,"If you saw the Shenmue 4 trailer that went viral recently and were hoping it was leading to an announcement, then you're going to be disappointed.

In a post on social media, Ys Net said the fake Shenmue 4 trailer ""uses our company logo without permission, falsely giving the impression that is an official Shenmue 4 related video produced by us.""

Don't Expect A New Dead Space Game Anytime Soon,"The Dead Space franchise is reportedly ""on ice"" at EA. And no, we're not referring to the frozen planet of Tau Volantis, the setting for Dead Space 3 . Basically, there are no plans for a new sequel, remake, or even reboot of the survival-horror franchise. Insider Gaming states that EA sources have informed them about the latest Dead Space direction--or lack of direction, in this case. In early 2023, a remake of Dead Space was released, making people speculate about a new sequel or future remakes. But instead, there reportedly won't be any sort of followup anytime soon. GameSpot has reached out to EA for comment. The report adds that the same sources hope the company might sell the Dead Space franchise after EA sold itself for $55 billion to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund , Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and the private equity firm Silver Lake. The deal could lead to $20 billion in debt . As such, there's speculation EA could auction off Dead Space to help pay off that gigantic amount. But that raises questions: What company would want to acquire Dead Space? And would the sum be even a drop in the bucket against $20 billion? Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Where Winds Meet Devs Blown Away By Game's Massive Success,"Where Winds Meet has blown up since its global PC and PlayStation 5 launch on November 14, becoming one of the hottest games on Steam as of late.

Lead producer Beralt Lyu spoke to FRVR about the game recently reaching nine million players on November 29, just two weeks after its worldwide launch. Lyu explained that while the team always had faith in their Wuxia world, they weren't expecting this much success this quickly. ""We hoped it would find its audience, the players who would love the freedom and mystery we tried to create,"" Lyu said. ""But [nine] million players in two weeks … that number has honestly blown all our internal expectations out of the water. The mood in the studio is hard to put into words. There's definitely pride and excitement--seeing years of hard work resonate with so many people is a feeling like no other.

"Paramount Launches Hostile Bid To Buy Warner Bros., Offering Billions More Than Netflix","The battle for Warner Bros. is not over yet.

Discovery as part of a hostile takeover bid. Specifically, Paramount is offering $30 per share, compared to $27.75 from Netflix. That works out to $18 billion more in cash than Netflix. Additionally, Paramount wants to buy the entirety of WBD, not just the majority of the key entertainment assets that Netflix is proposing to buy. Paramount's $30-per-share offer works out to a total enterprise value of $108.4 billion, which Paramount said is a 139% premium on where the company was trading at in September 2025.

"GameStop's ""Trade Anything Day"" Included Dead Animals And Can Of Whoop-Ass","GameStop's ""Trade Anything Day"" took place on December 6 and, as expected, people brought in all manner of items to get some cash. GameStop said in a news release that it took in more than 80,000 trades across the US on December 6 alone, and people brought in lots of unexpected and usual items, including a taxidermied bobcat and goose, a speed limit sign, a Wii Netflix disc, a bowling ball, a tiny Jesus, and ""a literal can of whoop-ass."" This was all done as a marketing campaign to raise awareness for GameStop's trade-in program. The retailer also noted that people brought in ""a significant number"" of canned food goods to support food banks and pet shelters. One person attempted to trade in their dog (presumably as a joke, we hope!) but was rejected. Another person tried to trade in their Social Security card but GameStop said no.

Of course, that's what most developers would say. Perhaps more intriguingly, Kojima discussed with ananweb ( translated by Automaton ) how he does not know for sure if his idea for OD will even work. ""I can't say exactly what it is yet, nor do I know if it will work out. We've created stealth games and delivery games which were unlike anything before, but system-wise, they were similar to other games,"" he explained, referencing Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding.

"Grow A Garden Seeds - How To Get Seed Packs, Limited Time Seeds, And Rarities Explained","There are well over 200 individual Grow A Garden seeds you can plant in your plot of land in the Roblox game . Each one has a different rarity and value, and depending on the type of plant, they can either be harvested once or will keep growing new fruits indefinitely after you sell the ones you pick. However, with such a high turnaround for events and their exclusive seeds, you may wonder if there is another way to get them. Luckily, with recent changes to the game’s structure, there is now a way to get some older plants that were available during the Spring and Summer. Of course, once you get the high-value plants, you’ll want to have them grow, then expose them to as many Grow A Garden weather events as possible to increase their value with multipliers added to them via Grow A Garden mutations . Here are all the ways you can get your hands on Grow A Garden seeds and seed packs, including those you can only find during events. Table of Contents [ hide ] How to get Grow A Garden Seeds The Seed Shop has a wide variety of seeds you can purchase, though its stock is widely variable. How to get Grow A Garden Seeds The first way to get Grow A Garden seeds is to buy them from the Seed Shop. The catch is that there are varying odds on which plants will be available whenever the shop restocks, with the more common seeds restocking more often than those of higher rarity.

Grow A Garden Prickly Fruits Explained,"Which Grow A Garden fruits are of the prickly type? Each one of the hundreds of available plants has a type associated with it. Blueberries are, well, berries, while the invaluable early-to–mid game Bamboo plants are classified as woody. One of the more uncommon types is the prickly plants, and that’s an issue if you’re trying to turn in plants for a limited-time reward. Another thing you should be aware of is that fruits can have multiple types at once. For example, though the Rose is classified as a prickly fruit in this Roblox game , it’s also both a flower and a leafy-type plant.

"An AI VTuber Is Trying To Complete Hardcore Minecraft, And All Hell Is Breaking Loose","The popular AI VTuber Neuro-Sama is attempting to complete Minecraft Hardcore, and her human supervisors appear to be losing all hope following a series of comedic but disappointing failures on her part. Neuro is an AI-powered VTuber created by streamer Vedal987 , and she utilizes a large language model with rapid response times, and the ability to ""see"" screens, read her own Twitch chat, respond to speech in almost real time, and even play games. Now, she's attempting Minecraft's Hardcore mode--the permadeath version of Minecraft that wipes the game world as soon as one player dies. Vedal, along with fellow VTubers Crelly and Filian , has claimed that the Twitch stream will not end until the quartet complete the game. To complete Minecraft, the four need to get to The End to face off against the Ender Dragon --not an easy feat at the best of times, and certainly not when you're relying on a childlike AI to make the right decisions, follow instructions, and cheat death.

Tekken Boss Katsuhiro Harada Is Leaving Bandai Namco After 30 Years Of Iron Fist Tournaments,"Tekken development chief Katsuhiro Harada has announced that he'll be departing from the fighting game series and its publisher Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. Harada--who has worked on every Tekken game since the series first debuted in 1994--said in a social media post that the death of close friends in his life had led to him to consider how much time he had left as a creator, and after consulting PlayStation icon Ken Kutaragi, he decided to leave the publisher after spending 30 years working on the Tekken franchise. ""With the Tekken series reaching its 30th anniversary--an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to--I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close,"" Harada wrote in an online post. ""In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect. Those accumulated events made me reflect on the 'time I have left as a creator.' During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi--whom I respect as though he were another father--and received invaluable encouragement and guidance. His words quietly supported me in making this decision."" I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025.

In a separate post, Bandai Namco said it remains committed to future development and content for Tekken 8 and expressed gratitude to Harada for his decades of work. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Netflix Considered Buying EA - Report,"As 2025 winds down, the new biggest potential acquisitions of the year appear to be the $55 billion deal for EA by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and other investors and the more recent proposed $82 billion agreement for Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Studios. Now, a new report suggests that Netflix once considered buying EA and two other movie studios before the Warner Bros. negotiations came together. According to Bloomberg , Netflix executives previously debated whether the streamer should place bids for EA, Fox, and Disney. However, the management team reportedly couldn't agree on a deal and feared that its interest in those companies would hurt its standing with investors. The report doesn't include the details about when Netflix considered these acquisitions, especially since Disney is usually the company that buys other studios including Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. Disney purchased Fox's entertainment assets in 2019 following an extended approval process from government agencies around the world. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Five Nights At Freddy's 2 Defies Poor Reviews With Big Opening Weekend,"Last week, the early word on Five Nights At Freddy's 2 from critics was overwhelmingly negative , with only 12% on Rotten Tomatoes. It didn't matter to moviegoers, however, as audiences showed up to theaters to check out the sequel anyway. According to Deadline , Five Nights At Freddy's 2 had a $63 million opening weekend in the United States and Canada, and $46 million internationally against a reported $36-$51 million budget. That gave the film a $109 million global opening. The first Five Nights At Freddy's had a higher opening in 2023 with $80 million domestically, despite being released in tandem with the film's streaming premiere on Peacock. Regardless, this sequel's opening was big enough to kick Disney's Zootopia 2 out of the No. 1 slot after only a single weekend. It also earned Five Nights At Freddy's 2 a few box office records, including biggest opening for a post-Thanksgiving weekend, biggest December opening for a horror film, and the biggest December opening for Universal Pictures. Additionally, Five Nights At Freddy's 2 now has the third-highest grossing opening weekend for a PG-13 horror movie, behind only the original Five Nights At Freddy's and World War Z, which had $80 million and $66.4 million, respectively.

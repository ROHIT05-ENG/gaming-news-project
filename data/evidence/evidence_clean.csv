"It wasn't PlayStation, Switch, PC, or Xbox that dominated my family's gaming this Christmas - it was Netflix, on the TV","My household is tricky to please. A 12-year-old who essentially wants to play Fortnite 24/7, a four-year-old who wants to do what the 12-year-old is doing but can't because she's four, and me and my wife who want to do anything that'll keep those two happy for more than five minutes so we can sit on the sofa and drink a coffee because we deserve FIVE GODDAMN MINUTES! It doesn't sound like much of an ask, but it really is, trust me. I needed a Christmas Golden Goose, something I could tap into whenever family harmony started to teeter towards a level of chaos no amount of Cadbury's Heroes could remedy - while the Bluey scavenger hunt game is good, it definitely skews more four-year-old, and traditional video games were off the menu. In my festive hour of need, as if sent by Santa himself, Netflix provided. Yes, Netflix. And no, we didn't just watch The Grinch on repeat (although we did watch it a lot - the animated one, not the naff Jim Carrey one). Read more"

Fortnite X South Park Quests: How To Ride 5 Rides At Cartmanland And Complete Every Quest,"During Fortnite Chapter 6, most every cosmetic you could unlock from a pass or for free was earned simply by gaining XP in any mode. But Epic has returned to the old ways in Chapter 7, with unlockable cosmetics that require completing specific quests. Case in point is the Born in Chaos mini pass for Fortnite's new South Park crossover , which comes with a series of quests that you'll need to complete in order to unlock the otherwise-free cosmetics. That means that if you want to get those Terrance and Phillip doll pickaxes, you'll actually need to pay attention to these quests. Some of them you'll certainly complete by accident if you play Fortnite regularly, but others will require a bit of conscious effort. And we'll make it just a smidge easier by handling the thinking part for you--which is to say that we'll explain each quest in detail below. All of these quests must be completed in Battle Royale or Zero Build, and they provide pass progress only. The quests themselves don't offer XP directly, but there are three level skips you can unlock as you progress the event pass, and you can already earn one of them (worth 80,000 XP) by completing five quests. Completing four quests from a batch will award a Memberberry--collecting six Memberberries awards the Imaginationland Airship glider. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Hytale Is Not On Steam And May Never Be,"Hytale is finally out now, after 10 years of development. If you're looking for the game on Steam, you won't find it there because developer Hypixel launched the game exclusively through its own app . But why is Hytale not on Steam, and could it ever be released there? Here's what we know. Why not Steam? Executive producer Patrick Derbic said in a FAQ that Hypixel opted to release Hytale through its own launcher at first to allow the team to communicate more closely with its own fans and community. Derbic said bringing the game to Steam at launch might have brought a ""flood of cold first impressions that could overcorrect the game's direction."" This isn't to say that Hypixel wants to bury its head in the sand and avoid criticism, however. The studio said it does not shy away from ""honest, negative criticism,"" going on to say the developer itself has been ""very critical"" of the game it's making. Releasing on Hytale's own dedicated launcher was a purposeful decision the studio made to help ensure ""the first steps of our journey to be influenced by informed players rather than large-scale first impressions from those unfamiliar with the game's development background.""

Eidos Montreal Is Reportedly Working On A Big-Budget Game Similar To Wild,"The canceled open-world game Wild may get a spiritual successor of sorts from Deus Ex: Human Revolution developer Eidos Montreal. According to Insider Gaming , the unannounced title is codenamed P11 and features intriguing likenesses to the canned Ubisoft game. The report also states that P11 has been in development since 2019, with Unreal Engine 5 powering the project. However, Insider Gaming adds there have been ""significant setbacks"" for the game. In 2024, Embracer Group canned a Deus Ex game in development and cut 97 people from Eidos Montreal . The layoffs didn't stop there, either. Last year, another 75 employees lost their jobs at the studio. As for P11, an X user named Timur222 found that an Eidos Montreal employee on LinkedIn refers to the project as a ""AAAA"" game. Insider Gaming initially thought that Embracer may have somehow acquired the Wild rights from Ubisoft because this project looks so similar. Wild was revealed in 2014 , showing players riding a bear and even assuming the control of an eagle and rabbit. The PlayStation exclusive was reportedly canceled in 2021.

"Civilization 7 Is Finally Coming To Mobile, Exclusively On Apple Arcade","Sid Meier's Civilization 7 Arcade Edition will be added to the Apple Arcade game catalog on February 5 alongside a smattering of other new games.

Released last February for PC and consoles, Civilization 7 is a 4X strategy game where players guide a civilization through several different ages of history. Like the mobile port of Civilization 6, Civilization 7 Arcade Edition's content is comparable to the PC and console versions of the game, so this isn't some sort of radically inferior spin-off. The most novel thing about Civilization 7 Arcade Edition is that its UI has been specifically tailored to support touch controls on iPhone and iPad. Currently, the closest you can get to that is using the touchscreen for your cursor on a PC handheld or Nintendo Switch 2 . Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Hytale Getting ""Larger, More Bespoke"" Updates, But Not Right Away","Hytale is finally out now in early access following 10 years of development and a cancellation. Like other early-access games, Hytale isn't finished and may contain bugs and other oddities as developer Hypixel updates and improves the game over time. The studio has now outlined what's to come in the immediate future, and more of what's on tap on a longer-term horizon. For the ""first few months,"" Hypixel will release updates ""quickly and frequently"" to address the ""backlog of obvious construction sites"" that the team wants to address. For anyone just catching up, Hypixel purchased Hytale from Riot in November 2025 , and in the eight weeks since, the team did what it could to get Hytale out, but this also means the team didn't get to every item it wanted to fix or address. Looking further out, Hypixel said it plans to release ""larger, more bespoke updates"" and new features for Hytale. This will include official minigames, with development set to begin on these ""in the coming months."" These minigames will add ""systems and features that expand gameplay,"" Hypixel said.

Rockstar Games Bans Fan-Made Charlie Kirk Assassination Mission From GTA Online,"Rockstar Games has removed a fan-made mission simulating the assassination of Charlie Kirk from its popular online crime sim Grand Theft Auto Online, with the publisher even banning the conservative activist's name to prevent similar missions from appearing. As reported by IGN , developer Rockstar North introduced a new feature in the A Safehouse in the Hills update on December 10, allowing GTA Online players to create and share unofficial missions within the game. Not long after the tool was released, however, users began populating the mission directory with recreations of Charlie Kirk's assassination, with one titled ""We are Charlie Kirk"" being perhaps the most prominent of them. Now, according to a January 13 Variety report , Rockstar Games has removed this and added Kirk's name to its repository of banned words. Sources told Variety that the ""profanity filter"" the company refers to internally will be renamed to underscore that the tool isn't used only to flag obscenities but also various harmful content, too.

"Hytale Is Off To Quite The Strong Start, With Impressive Twitch Viewership Numbers","The launch of Hytale in early access yesterday saw over 400,000 people watching the game on Twitch. There is also speculation that the Minecraft-inspired sandbox game has reached almost 3 million sales, though there's confusion around that number currently. PC Gamer reported on the Hytale's popularity on Twitch, citing 420,000 viewers on January 13. At the time of publication, Hytale has around 112,000 viewers on Twitch , putting it only behind games like League of Legends and Grand Theft Auto V. In addition, a massive rumored concurrent-players for Hytale has been making the rounds, though the figure--2.8 million--seems too good to be true. It all stems from a stream posted by Hytale News on YouTube . GameSpot has reached out to developer Hypixel Studios about the statistic. The Best Confirmed Hytale Mods So Far See More Keep in mind PUBG holds the Steam record for most concurrent players with over 3.2 million people in January 2018.

"Granblue Fantasy Developer Cygames Opens AI Studio, But Doesn't Want You To Worry About It","Cygames, the developer and publisher behind the popular series of Granblue Fantasy video games , just opened an AI-focused studio. In response to the backlash toward this announcement, Cygames put out a message trying to assuage players' fears about generative AI's use in its games. The message isn't very reassuring, though. This kerfuffle started on January 9, when a post on Cygames' Japanese website revealed that Cygames AI Studio had been established. The announcement explains that this new studio will research and develop its own models and provide services to others while drawing on Cygames' game development history and expertise. The use of artificial intelligence, specifically generative AI, has become a very hot-button issue in the video game industry as of late. Games like Arc Raiders and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 have faced backlash over their use of the technology, and each new AI-related gaming announcement online usually draws the ire of fans.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons Players Are Waking Up To A Nice Surprise,"The big 3.0 update for Animal Crossing: New Horizons has gone live earlier than expected, bringing with it several major upgrades to the popular--and cozy--game ahead of its Switch 2 release on January 15 .

Arc Raiders Update Nerfs Weapons And Introduces Abyss Cosmetics,"Arc Raiders is getting a very short update in the middle of January, but it's one that was needed to nerf the power of two weapons: the Trigger 'Nade and Kettle. Embark Studios acknowledged the issues with both when laying out the details for Arc Raiders' 1.11.0 update. According to Embark , the Kettle's maximum fire rate of 600 was ""only realistically reachable by players using macros."" In other words, it played right into the hands of cheaters who were using outside software for an unfair advantage in the game. After the update, the Kettle can only reach a maximum fire rate of 450. Similarly, Embark noted that the Trigger 'Nade was dominating PvP battles and players used it more than any other grenade in the game. The nerf for this weapon is limiting the radius of damage to the center of the explosion and increasing the time it takes to detonate to 1.5 seconds to give opposing players a chance to react when it's deployed.

While Rockstar accused the fired developers of sharing important confidential information , it seems that at least some of that information has now been made public via the court case--including some very early details on what may be GTA 6 Online. People Make Games has been reporting on the faceoff between Rockstar Games and the IWGB since the start, and recently released a video covering the court proceedings so far. As part of the preliminary hearing, Rockstar's legal representative mentioned a ""top-secret element of GTA 6,"" which he said was so confidential he didn't feel confident speaking about it out loud, instead asking the judge to read it in private. Despite the supposedly top secret nature of this evidence, People Make Games was able to make an appointment to view the documents, as Rockstar had not applied for reporting restrictions to be placed upon the evidence. He has now reproduced those messages in full, showing an apparent conversation by a fired employee who was frustrated at not being able to book time off after Rockstar started cracking down on the number of employees being granted leave at one time.

"Roblox Has Added Facial Age Verification, With Very Mixed Results","Roblox has begun the global rollout of its facial age-check system, which will be required for all players who want to access in-game chat. The rollout has not gone smoothly so far, with some players' ages being wildly miscalculated, others finding workarounds, and some flat out refusing to engage with the verification system due to privacy concerns. Roblox's age verification system first started rolling out in Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands in early December, and now will be extended to all regions where chat is available. The AI-powered age check, which estimates a user's age by analyzing their face, must be completed to unlock chat features. Users over 13 have the option of verifying their age using ID instead. The estimated ages are used by Roblox to lock off chat with users who are outside of a person's age range--for example, a 13-year-old can chat with users between the ages of nine and 17, while a 16-year-old can chat with users aged 13-20. The new age check is designed to safeguard children from predators, following intense scrutiny on Roblox from legislators , the media , and concerned parents . However, users have quickly proven how easily it can be bypassed. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

The Battle Royale Manga Returns With A New Deluxe Edition,"Battle Royale: Deluxe Edition Volume 1 $44 (was $55) | Releases January 27 Preorder at Amazon Battle Royale has been a controversial IP since its first release, starting life as a book and then becoming a cult-classic movie. The franchise's success in print and on the big screen led to an inevitable manga adaptation, which returns later this month in a snazzy Deluxe Edition format. The first volume of the Battle Royale: Deluxe Edition will be available starting January 27, and preorders are available at Amazon--and best of all, it's currently discounted to $44 ahead of launch, saving you 20% off its standard $55 MSRP. Battle Royale: Deluxe Edition Volume 1 $44 (was $55) | Releases January 27 Battle Royale: Deluxe Edition Volume 1 is a 604-page, leather-bound hardcover omnibus featuring the first three volumes of the original manga series that ran from 2000 to 2005. It's unclear if the Deluxe Edition's publisher Yen Press is including a new--hopefully more faithful--translation or the controversial script from the English editions published by TokyoPop. While the Japanese version of the manga closely follows the original novel's plot, the English adaptation--handled by veteran comic book writer Keith Griffen--made substantial changes, resulting in several major plot holes in the later volumes. Either way, considering TokyoPop's releases have been out of print for several years, this new Deluxe Edition will be the easiest way to read the manga adaptation of the wildly popular franchise. Volume 1 launches on January 27, and we expect the next volumes in the series to go up for preorder in the near future. Preorder at Amazon Battle Royale would receive several sequel manga series over the years, but most of these are also hard to find due to their limited print runs. The most recent series in the IP is Battle Royale: Enforcers , which began serialization in 2022. Set decades after the original series, Enforcers takes place in the same universe. After a government artificial intelligence reactivates the infamous Program 68, the unruly kids of Daitoa Academy's Class F find themselves divided into squads, given weapons, and set loose to fight each other to the death. So far, four paperback volumes of the series have been released and translated into English. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

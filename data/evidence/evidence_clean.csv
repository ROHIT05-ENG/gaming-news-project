"I wasn't expecting much from Code Vein 2, but as a long-time Souls fan, its spin on the formula is a very pleasant surprise","I do love a Soulslike, but I'm a bit of a purist at heart - if you don't give me the exact combination of forlorn ambience, intricate world design, lore excavation, and precision combat developer FromSoftware so consistently delivers, I’m probably going to struggle to care. So, having completely overlooked Bandai Namco's anime-hued Soulslike Code Vein when it released back in 2019, its sequel was well off my radar. Until, that is, dark forces (Eurogamer editor-in-chief Tom Orry) conspired to nudge it into my orbit.

After three hours with a clearly more-or-less final build of the game, one rather gets the impression that the entire game has been built around the idea of a pendulum swinging back and forth.

"GTA 6 Will Be Available On As A Physical Release On Day One, Take-Two Confirms","Grand Theft Auto VI is coming this year after a long wait, and as it gets closer, rumors have begun to pop up about its launch. One rumor that has gained considerable traction is that the game would launch as a digital-only title , with a physical release coming at some point after release. The logic behind the rumor was that a physical release of the game could lead to early leaks ahead of the game's launch, and that publisher Take-Two might be willing to go to great lengths to avoid this. As it turns out, though, this is not the plan. Talking to Variety following an earnings call, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick has confirmed that the publisher does not intend to delay the game's physical release. When asked directly about the rumor that the game will not be available physically on launch day to avoid potential leaks, Zelnick gave a straightforward response: ""That's not the plan"". Based on this, it seems that you'll be able to buy the game on disc on launch day if that's your preference, which is good news for physical games stores around the world. Zelnick also said that the game's release date, November 19, 2026, is still locked in , although rumors will likely continue to circulate right through to release date--there's speculation that the game will carry a larger-than-normal price tag , for instance.

"Borderlands 4 On Switch 2 Has Paused Development, And Might Never Release","In a recently-released roadmap for the future of Borderlands 4 , one milestone was suspiciously absent --the game's Switch 2 port, which was previously delayed indefinitely just 10 days before its original launch date. Now, publisher Take-Two Interactive has revealed why that's the case, and it's not good news for anyone holding out for the game on Nintendo's hybrid console. In an interview with Variety , spokesperson Alan Lewis has revealed that development on the Switch 2 version is paused. ""We made the difficult decision to pause development on that SKU,"" he told the outlet, while affirming that the company is still committing to the system with upcoming games like PGA Tour 2K25 and WWE 2K26. The use of the word ""pause"" indicates that development on the Switch 2 port of Borderlands 4 could, theoretically, resume in the future, as it's not technically cancelled, but there's no guarantee that this will happen. The game reportedly sold below expectations at launch, despite also having the biggest launch in the franchise's history . Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Beloved Baldur's Gate 3 Characters Are Getting New Magic The Gathering Cards,"Another Magic: The Gathering Secret Lair Superdrop is on its way, two weeks after the Fallout TV show featured in a quartet of themed drops. This time, however, there are seven drops themed around Dungeons & Dragons, and two of them focus on fan-favorite heroes from Baldur's Gate 3. Shadowheart, Dark Justiciar First is Secret Lair x Dungeons & Dragons: Shadowheart's Devotion, which highlights the half-elf cleric of Shar. Her legendary creature card from Battle for Baldur's Gate is among the five reprints in the drop, along with an ancient dragon and three cards that would synergize well with her in a Shadowheart commander deck: Shadowheart, Dark Justiciar Beseech the Queen Black Market Victimize Ancient Bronze Dragon Gale, as he appears on Brainstorm The other Baldur's Gate 3 drop is called Secret Lair x Dungeons & Dragons: Gale's Ambition, and it features the wizard from Waterdeep.

"Generative AI Is Not Going To ""Eat"" The Games Industry, Expert Says","Recently, popular video game stocks like GTA 6 owner Take-Two ($TTWO), game development engine Unity ($U), and sandbox game Roblox ($RBLX) saw huge sell-offs that hammered share prices in the wake of Google's announcement of a new generative AI tool called Project Genie. The product claims it can create worlds ""generated in real time,"" and people quickly put it to use to create rip-offs of Mario and Fortnite , among many others. The generative AI tool seemingly spooked some investors, prompting the stocks to get hammered. But how big of a threat to the industry mainstays is Project Genie, or generative AI systems like it?

"GTA 6 Still On Track For November Release, Marketing Campaign Kicks Off This Summer","As part of Take-Two's earnings announcement today, the company confirmed that Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto VI remains on track for release on November 19, 2026.

GTA 6 was originally set to release in Fall 2025 before it shifted to May 26, 2026 and then again to November 19, 2026. Rockstar said it needed more time to make the game the best it could be.

Take A Look At These Two Chappell Roan Fortnite Skins Coming This Week,"After a few weeks of rumors, Epic Games finally revealed that Chappell Roan will be the next Fortnite Festival headlining artist when the new music pass launches on Thursday, February 5. As is usually the case with these things, Roan will have a skin, the Pink Pony Club jam track, and other cosmetics on the new Heartcore music pass, along with an additional set of items and jam tracks available for direct purchase in the item shop. Buying the music pass--which is included with Fortnite Crew, or can be purchased on its own for 1400 V-Bucks--will instantly unlock the Chappell Roan skin. Players can then unlock the rest of the items on the pass, including several musical instruments and an additional style for the Chappell Roan skin, by gaining XP in any Fortnite mode. There should be a number of jam tracks other than Pink Pony Club included on the pass, but we don't know what they are yet. And there will also be some free items on the pass that you can earn without buying it. Gallery Over in the shop, we'll have the Roan of Arc skin, with the singer sporting her iconic armored look from the 2024 VMAs. Roan will also be the first Festival Headliner to have a sidekick--a Pink Pony in the style of a Fortnite piñata--which will be part of her shop bundle. Typically, a season headliner also has at least two new jam tracks in the shop, but Epic's announcement didn't mention any new songs other than Pink Pony Club. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Alamo Drafthouse's Resident Evil-Inspired Menu Includes A Jill Sandwich,"Resident Evil Requiem is just a few weeks away, but Alamo Drafthouse is starting the party early with its Resident Evil-inspired menu for its upcoming free screenings. Jill Valentine may not be in Requiem, but the original RE heroine is finally getting Jill's Sandwich, which is a play on the infamous line in the first game. For the record, a Jill's Sandwich is comprised of double all-beef patties, applewood smoked bacon, melty cheese, pickles, a special burger sauce, and a butter-toasted bun. You can wash that down with a T-Virus Cocktail or a Blue Umbrella Serum , although the Drafthouse employees will probably give you a soda if you ask for it. Jill's Sandwich The other items on this menu are the Red + Green Herb Hot Dog Combo--which doesn't feature any healing effects from the herbs--and Bingo! Fried Chicken. These items are only available during the Raccoon City Cinema screenings from February 6-27. The films in this mini festival include The Cabin in the Woods, The Thing, The Ring, and Longlegs. The latter is an apt choice, since Longlegs star Maika Monroe recently appeared in a live-action trailer for Resident Evil Requiem . Continue Reading at GameSpot"

MLB The Show 26 Takes Players From College To The Hall Of Fame,"Getting into the Baseball Hall of Fame is an impossible dream for most professional players, but that journey will be part of a new addition to MLB The Show 26 . This year, the game will let players track their character through college and into the Major Leagues. And if they finish Road To The Show: Road to Cooperstown, then a spot in the Hall of Fame awaits.

Did Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 Hint That The Worst Fallout: New Vegas Ending Could Be Canon?,"With The Ghoul reactivating Mr. House, Lucy discovering the mainframe of her father’s devices, and Maximus having to protect Freeside, the penultimate episode of Fallout season two raised the stakes for an all-out finale in New Vegas. Yet for as much time as this episode dedicated to building up relationships and faction statuses, episode seven still delivered the goods when it came to action and references to the original games. With that being said, let’s dive right in to this week’s easter eggs: New (California) Threads When The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) and Maximus realize they need to stock up to battle the Deathclaws that are overrunning the strip, they head to a secret New California Republic armory. While at first nothing seems to stand out amongst the arsenal of weapons, a single piece stands out: an NCR themed suit of power armor. While we’re not quite sure why this even exists, there’s no denying the power of good brand recognition. Not A Ghoul But Something Much Worse Throughout the episode, Thaddeus’ (Johnny Pemberton) condition worsens. Curious as to when his nose will fall off, he shows The Ghoul an alarming new mutation he’s developed: a gaping mouth growing in the center of his chest (in addition to his arm falling off). Now while it’s not quite confirmed what exactly he turning into, it’s definitely not a ghoul. For my money, he’s showing signs of turning into a Centaur. One of the most horrifying creatures in the Fallout universe. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Sony Files Patent For Generative-AI Podcast Starring Game Characters,"Putting AI elements in games has already become a bigger part of the industry, and now Sony wants AI to talk about games as well. Sony has filed a patent for a generative AI podcast that would be starring its video game characters. The complete patent listing for Sony's LLM-based generative podcast for gamers puts forth some ambitious ideas even though it doesn't settle every issue that may arise from them. According to the listing, Sony sees these podcasts as a way to reach individual gamers with news tailored to their tastes that comes in the form of an audio or video podcast hosted by the main character or characters of a game recently played on the console. Deepfake voices will sidestep the need for actors, as the LLM creates banter and a news-like program that delivers tips, gaming news, and more games of interest to the player in question. The patent doesn't state if the generative podcast would be limited to Sony's proprietary characters or if it would extend to characters from third-party games. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Switch 2 Price Could Go Up By $50 Or $100, Expert Predicts","The Switch 2 could get a price hike in 2026, but how much more should people prepare to pay? According to Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad , Nintendo may opt to raise the price of the Switch 2 by $50 or $100. The Switch 2 currently sells for $450 on its own or $500 with Mario Kart World. He said this against the backdrop of the impact of tariffs and increasing memory prices and how those factors could impact the Switch 2's price. Nintendo said in its latest earnings briefing that there will be no impact during the current fiscal year, but for the fiscal year that begins in April 2026, these factors could ""put pressure"" on the company's earnings, Ahmad said. ""Would need to reconsider pricing / strategy at that point,"" Ahmad said. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Netflix's Ancient PS3 App Is Going Offline Next Month,"Bad news for PlayStation 3 owners hoping to watch Love is Blind on their CRT: Netflix is discontinuing the streaming app from Sony's legacy console a month from now. A Reddit post from a CRT-enthusiast community shared the announcement seen on the PS3 Netflix app, which reads: ""Unfortunately, Netflix will no longer be available on this device after March 2, 2026."" Streaming services phasing out support for older devices shouldn't be a surprise, but what's striking about this shutdown is how long the PS3 Netflix app was functioning. Netflix launched for PS3 in late 2009--but due to an exclusivity deal that the streaming giant had with Xbox, the service was only available through a disc that the company sent in the mail. It took until later in 2010 for Netflix on PS3 to go disc-free with a downloadable app. Netflix had a similar arrangement for the Wii , but that app was discontinued in 2018.

"Warcraft IP Is ""Underutilized,"" Blizzard Boss Says","Blizzard executive Holly Longdale has stated that the Warcraft IP is ""underutilized,"" suggesting that the company might have new projects or in store to help beef it up and make the most of it. To be sure, Blizzard has already expanded the Warcraft franchise in a number of ways, including the 2016 movie and the digital card game Hearthstone, along with books and comics. But Longdale thinks Warcraft has even more room to grow. ""It's a fantastic IP.

""And that means evolving what Warcraft means, what it is, and where it's going. We want it to be approachable."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Free Fortnite Cosmetics Are Coming To Get You To Buy More Games On Epic's Store,"Epic plans to juice game sales on its PC storefront by bundling free Fortnite cosmetics with third-party titles. The first such instance of this new ""official program"" appears to be Resident Evil Requiem, as people who preorder the game on the Epic Games Store will receive a Grace Ashcroft skin in the battle-royale title. The goal, according to Epic, is ""to help developers sell more games on the Epic Games Store by leveraging the marketing power of Fortnite ."" The first partners for the program include Capcom, Genshin Impact's miHoYo, Dave the Diver's MintRocket, and Crimson Desert's Pearl Abyss. Epic has done something similar in the past with Alan Wake 2 , as people who preordered the sequel years ago got an Alan Wake skin in Fortnite. People Spent More But Played Less On The Epic Games Store In 2025 See More This comes as part of a year-in-review blog in which Epic acknowledged people spent more but played less on the Epic Games Store in 2025 . Fortnite continues to be the most-popular title on the Epic Games Store, hence the company using its massive appeal to drive third-party sales on the platform. However, Circana senior director Mat Piscatella seemingly expressed doubts about the new program on Bluesky . ""Super healthy market when one of the recognized key incentives for driving purchases of a new game on a platform is content for a completely different game that already dominates player engagement [I don't know],"" he wrote.

Nintendo's $35 Talking Flower Will Briefly Tell You The Wrong Time,"Nintendo recently held a hands-on showcase event with a bevy of demos for upcoming games. And while less of a focus than the games themselves, the presentation also included an opportunity for a closer look at some of its upcoming products like the new Mario Wonder Amiibo figures and $35 Talking Flower . We had a chance to get hands on with the Alarmo-adjacent doodad and it is certainly a talking flower. A brief video walked us through the functionality. It will say random phrases from time to time, and you can press a button on the front to prompt it to speak. You can set a wake-up time or bedtime so the flower will wish you well, and that way it'll stay quiet at night. The phrases shift based on the time of day, and it's attuned to the room temperature so it can tell you if it's a little chillier today, and it will alert you if it needs a battery change. In music mode it can activate a ""Wonder Mode,"" playing the Mario Wonder music. The oddest feature, so to speak, is the ability to tell the time, but Talking Flower will sometimes tell you the wrong time. In the video demonstration he said it was 10 AM, then quickly corrected himself to say it's actually 9 AM. What a little scamp! An unreliable, possibly infuriating little scamp.

"Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot Should Resign, Union Reps Say","Two union representatives for Ubisoft have voiced their belief that CEO Yves Guillemot should resign. This comes after a wave of layoffs, project cancellations, and studio restructuring that hit the company best known for Assassin's Creed and Far Cry. In January, Ubisoft announced plans to split the company into several ""Creative Houses"" dedicated to specific franchises. Internally, it also canceled several projects like Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake , laid off developers, closed studios , and implemented a return-to-office mandate. This has angered many Ubisoft developers , who are planning to strike later this month. In a recent interview with Game Developer , Ubisoft union representatives Marc Rutschlé and Chakib Mataoui placed most of the blame on the CEO and indicated they'd like a leadership change at Ubisoft. ""I think Guillemot should move away at this point. I think the level of hate people have for him [means] he should move on. Then, we could build some sort of trust again,"" Rutschlé explained.

"Apex Legends Adds Breachable Windows In Season 28, And Gives Fuse A Rocket Jump","Apex Legends Season 28 is also the start of the battle royale's Year 7, and the Respawn team is keeping to tradition by implementing a substantial gameplay change for the game's birthday. Season 28, titled Breach, introduces breakable windows and skylights to Apex Legends called Hardlight Meshes. These surfaces can be breached by squads trying to find additional ways into a building, or reinforced by players bunkering inside who are trying to hold a point-of-interest. These new mechanics sound like some you might find in Rainbow Six Siege (or Highguard , the recently released raid shooter from former Apex Legends developers). This isn't a small change, either. Hardlight Meshes will be added to all of the maps rotating into the battle royale playlists this season (World's Edge, Broken Moon, and E-District). Save for Olympus, these three maps have the most urban environments of all of Apex Legends' maps. That means there are plenty of buildings that have been remade by the sole conceit that they now have multiple breach points, making them significantly harder to defend. ""As with all new additions to Apex, community feedback will certainly drive the conversation and inform our future updates and tuning,"" senior game designer Connor Monahan told me. ""Playtesting internally, the places where we feel Hardlight [has] the most [impact] fall into two big categories. The first category is buildings previously very difficult to assault that now have narrow weaknesses you can exploit to break in. Examples that come to mind are some Lunar buildings--the tube-shaped structures--on [Broken] Moon, four-story buildings and Powerbank on E-District, and Lava Siphon on World's Edge. There are now new choke points and entries that make pressuring teams bunkered inside much more viable."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
New Third-Person World War 2 Game Brings Nazi Hunting Up Close And Personal,"For the last two decades, the vast majority of World War 2 games have been first-person shooters. ProbablyMonsters' upcoming title, Nekome: Nazi Hunter, is going to buck that trend with its single-player third-person experience. In the first teaser for the game, the main character demonstrates his abilities by fatally stabbing a Nazi soldier. The lead character's name is Vano Nastasu, and he's not a soldier.

"Obsidian Focusing On More Games In Avowed's Universe, But Not The Outer Worlds 3 - Report","Obsidian Entertainment was one of Microsoft's busiest studios in 2025, releasing three games in the short 12 months of the year. While two of its role-playing games, Avowed and The Outer Worlds 2 were favorably received, only one of them fits into the studio's future. According to a report by Bloomberg , Obsidian is not currently working on a third entry in The Outer Worlds franchise, and is instead exploring ideas that expand on the setting introduced to players in Avowed. Avowed itself lives within the Pillars of Eternity universe, of which there are multiple Obsidian-developed games, so it might not be surprising that this is where the studio is choosing to continue focusing efforts. The interview delves into how the single studio managed to put out three games in a single year, with studio design director Josh Sawyer chalking it up to unexpected project timelines, scope pivots, and poor planning. ""Spacing those releases helps the company manage its resources and not burn everybody out,"" Sawyer says. ""It's not good to release three games in the same year. It's the result of things going wrong."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Highguard's 5v5 Experiment Is Now A Permanent Game Mode,"Given how much has happened since, it might come as a surprise that Highguard has been out for just one week. Since then, the game has received a few patches , and an entirely new game mode that is now going to stick around. Over the weekend, Highguard developer Wildlight introduced a 5v5 game mode to sit alongside its standard 3v3 queues, stating that it would be a limited-time mode. Given the response by players, the new game mode has now become permanent, letting you enjoy the game's mix of looting and raiding with hopefully more player interactions in the large, open map. Wildlight announced the news on X , stating that the player split between its two modes was relatively even across the weekend. The addition of two more players on each team has been a favorable change to some players, with the game even emerging from its negative review status on Steam up to ""Mixed"" over the weekend. The effect might be short lived, however, as the increased player counts over the weekend has since subsided, with numbers now hovering below last week's worst days. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Has Somehow Sold Another 2.3 Million Copies In The Past Nine Months,"Nintendo has revealed that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has sold another 2.39 million copies globally from April through December 2025, showcasing incredible staying power for the nearly nine-year-old Switch game. What's even more impressive is this number comes during a timeframe that saw the launch of Switch 2 exclusive Mario Kart World in June. The newest sales figure comes from Nintendo's financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 , which runs from April 1, 2025 through March 31, 2026. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was the third best-selling original Switch game during that timespan. Meanwhile, newcomers Pokemon Legends: Z-A and Super Mario Galaxy 2 took the top two spots, with 8.41 million and 2.42 million copies sold worldwide, respectively. As for Pokemon Legends: Z-A, the Switch 2 Edition added another 3.89 million copies sold (yes, that includes hardware bundles), meaning together with the Switch version, the action-RPG sits at 12.3 million copies sold. Overall, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has sold 70.59 million units since arriving on Switch in April 2017. That makes it the best-selling Switch game of all time . Technically, the racing game first launched on Wii U in May 2014 and has sold 8.46 million copies separately on that Nintendo platform. As for Mario Kart World, the Switch 2 exclusive is the top-selling game on Nintendo's new console with 14.03 million units sold. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
How Mario Tennis Fever Sets Itself Apart From Other Recent Mario Sports Games,"Mario's sports spin-offs during the Switch era have been mostly decent, but also, largely unsurprising. There have been few frills and largely anemic single-player modes, and the occasional experiment like Mario Golf Super Rush have been divisive. Mario Tennis Fever is the first in the sport spin-off genre on Switch 2, and a chance to set a new course for the company. After a hands-on with it at a recent Nintendo event, I can't say whether it has course-corrected on the single-player, but the multiplayer is so chockablock with options and game-changing effects that I'm intrigued. In fact, the main hook of the new game--the titular Fever rackets--have such wild impacts on the court that at times Fever felt more like a party game than a sports title. Our couch competitive experience was frequently interrupted by raucous trash talk and surprised screams as new effects totally changed the match mid-volley. But first, the basics. A short tutorial explained the mechanics of Mario Tennis Fever, which are largely unchanged from previous tennis titles. You serve and volley just as you'd expect, and you hit the button early or double-tap for charged and powered-up effects, respectively. Mario and the gang look especially great here, thanks to the enhanced power of the Switch 2 and relatively limited scope of what's on screen. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Super Mario Wonder Turns Into Mario Party With The Bellabel Park Expansion,"So far, Nintendo's Switch 2 upgrade packs have been all over the map. There are the smaller ones with just a few quality-of-life features like Animal Crossing, serious upgrades like the Legend of Zelda games, and larger-scale expansions like Kirby's Star-Crossed World expansion. Super Mario Bros. Wonder's Switch 2 upgrade, Meetup at Bellabel Park, is priced like a larger expansion, but that doesn't quite capture the nature of what it is. Instead, based on a hands-on experience with Nintendo, it transforms the game into something else entirely, borrowing liberally from the Mario Party series. Though Mario Wonder allowed you to go through its stages in multiplayer, Bellabel Park is centered around bespoke multiplayer minigames, using the Mario Wonder platforming as its mechanical underpinnings. So unlike an actual Mario Party game, in which the randomized minigames might challenge you to do new and unfamiliar things at a regular clip, these feel more like platforming challenges with a little bit of party game spirit. Since they're built around traditional Mario platforming, the challenges aren't entirely competitive. We first played a cooperative level that had one player using the Switch 2 mouse functionality to draw Donut Blocks, Mario Maker style, to guide the other three players through a stage that was one big pit hazard. That by itself would be not much more than a neat toy-like experiment, but the stage was also littered with occasional hazards and puzzle challenges, like a special coin nested inside a set of breakable boxes. The Donut Block player would need to draw a path for a spike ball to roll its way into the boxes so that the other players could access the coin; and naturally, we were all shouting out tips of where and how to draw the path, adding to the chaotic fun of the whole experience.

Switch 2's Virtual Boy Is For A Very Specific Type Of Nintendo Fan,"Nintendo doesn't have very many high-profile missteps, which makes it all the more notorious when one of its flagship products falters. The Wii U is the most recent example, but before that the all-timer was the Virtual Boy--a mid-'90s experiment in early 3D effects that never caught on. Nintendo fans have identified many possible causes for this--the unwieldy design, the all-red graphics, the middling library--but whatever the cause, it's been a sore spot in Nintendo history. Now the company is bringing it back with emulation and two accessory options (one or the other is required) on the Switch 2. It works well, but will likely serve more as a museum piece for fans of Nintendo history than a strong part of the gaming library. During a Nintendo event, we were able to try the Virtual Boy emulation, with a Switch 2 console fitted into the pricey Virtual Boy accessory . (The cardboard model was on display behind glass, but we weren't able to try it.) The $100 option looks just like my memory of a Virtual Boy in a Toys R Us kiosk, complete with its tripod stand and foam face shield. The only major differences are that this one has a Switch 2 noticeably lodged into it, and there is no attached controller since you'll just use paired Joy-Cons or Pro Controller. It was notable, more as an interesting curiosity than anything else, that about half of the Switch console was actually sticking out of the bottom of the Virtual Boy accessory. The actual Virtual Boy display was only utilizing roughly the top half of the screen. Then there's the experience of actually putting hands (and eyes) on it. The foam face shield was actually very comfortable and did a great job blocking out the ambient light of the room. Hunching over to get my eyes in the correct position was less comfortable, but I learned afterwards that I would have been allowed to adjust the table height on request, so that may just be user error on my part. Still, it does raise the specter of one key weakness of the Virtual Boy: You have to find a position to play and stay planted there, rather than naturally shift around as people tend to do when relaxing with a video game. The field-of-view was slightly odd, also, as I had to lift my head up above the face shield slightly and look down ""into"" the display to see the part of the UI that explained the suspend menu shortcut. And of course, the red-and-black display does still feel fairly harsh, and emerging from the darkened cocoon of the Virtual Boy display is disorienting. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Resident Evil Requiem And Pragmata Are Impressive Switch 2 Showpieces,"The Nintendo Switch was a massive success, but it was built primarily on the strength of first-party and less-demanding third-party games. We all knew you didn't turn to the Switch for the visual splendor offered on its competitors. The Switch 2 has brought things slightly more towards parity, and we've seen a few third-party standouts like Cyberpunk 2077 and Star Wars Outlaws that push the hardware. Those will soon be joined by two high-profile Capcom games, Resident Evil Requiem and Pragmata, which were both visually impressive at a recent Nintendo hands-on event. Both demos on display were familiar ones. For Resident Evil, it was the opening moments as Grace begins exploring the hospital that we've seen demonstrated in other presentations, and for Pragmata it was the same demo that's available on Steam now. But that also allows a direct comparison, and to my surprise, it was pretty favorable in both cases. Resident Evil Requiem looked great, maintaining the high-fidelity distressed look that lends itself to the creepy atmosphere. Things in the hospital look worn and used, sometimes decaying, which helps set a mood, and the Switch 2 pulled off that look very well. In handheld mode, the smaller screen may have looked even better than on a big screen, since the more compact pixel density could hide some of the less-detailed parts. Plus, with the ability to play on a handheld you could play it in bed, hiding under the covers. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"The Switch Is Now Nintendo's Best-Selling System Ever, But Still Trails PS2","The original Nintendo Switch has surpassed the DS in sales, officially reaching a milestone as Nintendo's best-selling video game system of all time. With 155.37 million units sold as of the last week of December 2025, the Switch only trails Sony's PlayStation 2 for the all-time record. This achievement was long expected, with the Switch shown to be inching toward the DS's numbers in Nintendo's last quarterly earnings report. Nintendo DS, which was released in 2004 and has long since been discontinued, sold 154.02 million units in its lifetime. For the Switch to dethrone the PS2, it'll have to overtake its astounding figure of over 160 million consoles sold --if Nintendo can somehow squeeze out more than 5 million sales.

"The Division Definitive Edition Released, Even Though Ubisoft Never Announced It","Ubisoft has released The Division: Definitive Edition, although that may come as a surprise as the company never officially announced it. After being spotted in the wild in Japan , some theorized that the Definitive Edition might be a remaster of sorts for the 2016 game for its 10th anniversary. However, the Definitive Edition is actually a new $50 version of the game that includes the game's previously released expansions, Underground, Survival, and Last Stand, along with weapon skins and gear sets. The Definitive Edition store page does not mention any graphical upgrades, but people playing on Xbox Series X|S or PS5 may see improvements due to upscaling on those systems. The store pages also do not list off any new features or improvements. The game was originally released for Xbox One, PS4, and PC in 2016. The Division's new Definitive Edition does not appear to be available on Steam. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

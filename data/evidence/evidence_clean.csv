"Comcept, The Studio Behind Mighty No. 9 And ReCore, Shuts Down","Comcept, the studio formed and once headed by storied former Capcom producer Keiji Inafune, has officially closed its doors. The news was first reported on Japanese website Gamebiz , which posted a reproduction of the official closure announcement, which was then translated by Gematsu . Comcept was formed in 2010 by Keiji Inafune, who had left Capcom after enduring a string of high-profile cancellations, including Mega Man Legends 3 . Comcept operated primarily as a planning company, working together with other developers to bring game ideas to market. The company was instrumental in the creation of a variety of titles, including Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z , Soul Sacrifice , and ReCore . By far its most well-known title was Mighty No. 9 , a crowdfunded attempt to modernize and revive the platforming conventions of the classic Mega Man games that wound up fraught with controversy and production issues, releasing to a mixed reception. After the failure of a subsequent Kickstarter for the adventure game Red Ash, the cancellation of 3DS action title Kaio: King of Pirates , and the speedy end-of-service for its online mobile game Dragon & Colonies, Comcept was acquired by prominent Japanese game developer Level-5 and renamed Level-5 Comcept.

Richer Households Now Make Up The Majority Of Gaming Hardware Buyers,"Some new eye-opening data from Circana demonstrates the impacts of gaming hardware getting more expensive, as over half the households who bought gaming hardware recently made $100,000 or more a year. More specifically, a post from Circana's Senior Director Mat Piscatella on Bluesky revealed that 53% of households who bought new video game hardware, like the Nintendo Switch 2 or PS5 Pro, in Q4 2025 made more than $100,000 annually. In Q1 2022, only 40% of buyers were above that threshold. Conversely, poorer households are buying less gaming hardware , as those making under $50,000 a year were just 19% of the buyers in Q4 2025, but they were 31% of the consumer base in Q1 2022. Essentially, this data shows that majority of consumers buying new hardware are from a smaller, richer base. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"Steal A Brainrot, The Incredibly Popular Roblox Game, Gets A Movie Deal","Steal a Brainrot, the immensely popular Roblox game that just had a concert with Bruno Mars , could become a movie. Story Kitchen , the production company that's made a name for itself with video game adaptations, has begun the development process on a Steal a Brainrot movie, Deadline reported. The creators of the game are involved, too, the report said. Crucially, the report said the Steal a Brainrot movie is in ""early development."" Plenty of movies get announced but never materialize , for any number of reasons. There is no word yet if the proposed Steal a Brainrot movie could be planned for a theatrical or streaming release.

Nintendo Issues Correction Over Leaked Nintendo Switch Online GameCube Games,"A Walmart advertisement showing two unannounced GameCube games coming to Nintendo Switch Online was actually a mistake from Nintendo itself, and the two titles aren't planned for the service as of yet. After Walmart's Nintendo page displayed a graphic including Metroid Prime 2: Echoes and Pikmin 2, a Nintendo of America spokesperson told IGN that it ""provided a retailer with an image of Nintendo GameCube -- Nintendo Classics titles that incorrectly included games that are not planned for release at this time."" The image has since been removed. The error on Nintendo's part is somewhat surprising, considering how airtight the company's marketing usually is. But that hasn't stopped careful observers from spotting hints of other unannounced retro games possibly making it into the Nintendo Classics library, such as a blurry image hiding some select Nintendo 64 titles .

Marathon Limited Edition DualSense Controller $85 | Releases March 5 The Marathon DualSense controller features a distinctive aesthetic that aligns with the game's sci-fi themes and graphic design.

It Seems Developers Don't Want To Make Xbox Games Much Anymore,"Game developers are continuing to prefer working on games for PC and PlayStation 5 over Xbox Series X|S, according to new data from the Game Developers Conference's latest report tracking the state of the games industry over the last year. The latest report from GDC (via Christopher Dring at The Game Business ) showed a continued decline in developers working on projects for Xbox. While PC remains the one platform to rule them all, with 83% of surveyed developers currently making games for it and 80% saying they want to, developers are making games for PlayStation 5 at a seven-percentage-point difference over Xbox Series X|S. (47% versus 40%, to be exact.) This difference extends to developer interest as well, with 40% of surveyors saying they want to work on PS5 projects compared to just 20% for Xbox Series X|S. The Steam Deck, meanwhile, is apparently the fourth-most-used platform, as 28% of developers are making or optimizing games for Valve's handheld console. Speaking of handheld consoles, 39% of participants say they're interested in making games for the Nintendo Switch 2, putting it just one percentage point behind the Steam Deck in terms of developer interest (40%).

Here's This Week's Free Game From The Epic Games Store On Mobile,"For the last couple of years, the Epic Games Store has given away free games every week through its PC storefront.

Crimson Desert Features Multiple Playable Characters And A Missile-Firing Mech,"Ahead of Crimson Desert 's March 19 launch, developer Pearl Abyss has shared a 15-minute features-overview video detailing some of what you can expect in the open-world action-adventure game. This includes a grappling hook, a mountable dragon, a pilotable mech to wreak some havoc, and two more playable characters. The features-overview video went over primary protagonist Kliff's journey of saving the world of Pywel, a medieval-fantasy continent that is embroiled in conflict from political and supernatural forces. Over the course of 15 minutes, Pearl Abyss showcased just a few elements of the game, like the two additional playable characters that will accompany Kliff on his expedition. We don't meet them, so we don't know their names or their lore, but they look rather fascinating, and the studio said each of the playable characters has their own skills, combat styles, and weapons. One is a swift female warrior with a gigantic sword (claymore style) who appears to wield a flintlock pistol. The other is a bruising male tank using some sort of Barret-like arm cannon and a massive axe. Later in the video, we can see Kliff traversing the massive open-world with multiple mid-air jumps, a grappling hook to latch onto and swing from ledges, a huge dragon to ""soar high above"" Pywel, and a missile-firing mech so you can blow a bunch of stuff up instead of just swinging your sword and RKO-ing enemies to oblivion.

Abide Is A First-Person Horror Game Made With Stop-Motion Animation,"There's no shortage of mystery games on Steam, but developer Talha & Jack Co is aiming to put a handcrafted--and gruesome--feel on that genre with its next title, Abide. The duo behind games like Judero and Mashina has revealed its grisly new mystery game, which uses traditionally animated dolls and prosthetic gore effects to tell a stomach-churning narrative that looks heavily inspired by Italian Giallo thrillers. You can check out the reveal trailer below. Set in the secluded, supposedly idyllic St Boniface Retreat, Abide will see players explore a community experimenting with new therapeutic techniques for its residents. At night, monsters and other horrors lurk outside the walls of the rehabilitation center, and players can push their luck by venturing out from relative safety to encounter these threats. That day/night cycle will create two distinct experiences: Investigations and relationship-building exercises will unfold during daylight hours, while the night brings mystery, intrigue, and psychological horror. Players will choose who to spend their time with as they build trust with several eccentric characters, and choices made during the adventure will have tangible effects on the world around them. That sense of realism is reflected in the design of the characters, as each one has been meticulously handcrafted using ball-jointed art doll-techniques, painted with modelling acrylics, and brought to life by a talented voice actor.

Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream Lets You Have A Love Square With A Clown Because Why Not?,"Nintendo dropped a 22-minute Direct presentation for the upcoming social-life sim Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream , which revealed all kinds of fun and fascinating features for the Switch-exclusive. Tucked in the broadcast was an interesting dilemma, and if you blinked, you might've missed it, but let me point it out for all to see: You can not only fall in love with a clown, but you can get involved in a love square with said clown because, well ... everyone loves clowns, right? Yes, the forthcoming Living the Dream, the latest entry in the Tomodachi franchise following 2014's Tomodachi Life , allows you to go on dates with a clown named Hugh Morris. One of the main Miis in the trailer, Angie, admits to us that she ""can't hold back"" her feelings for the clown and ""needs to tell him"" how she feels. The player encourages Angie, suggesting she ""go for it."" Which she does! She invites Hugh on a Ferris wheel date, where she confesses her feelings ""the old-fashioned way."" That is, stuttering through rosy cheeks and nervous breaths. Morris, oblivious, says he's ""totally in love with the view"" from inside the Ferris wheel, too. Angie clarifies what she meant, blurting out that she's ""in love"" with him and asks to go on a real date. As hearts pound in the background, a Mii named Jess somehow enters the Ferris wheel and professes that the one who ""truly loves"" Morris is them. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream Adds Same-Sex Relationships And Non-Binary Miis,"More than 10 years after vowing to make a ""more inclusive"" Tomodachi Life game, Nintendo has made good on that promise, revealing in a Nintendo Direct that Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream will add not only same-sex romances, but the option to make non-binary Mii characters. The 22-minute Direct for the Switch game demonstrated the character creation process for Miis, which includes three gender options: Male, Female, and Non-Binary. Additionally, players can pick any (or none) of the three options for their character's dating preferences. When the previous entry in the wacky Tomodachi Life series, released in 2013 for Nintendo 3DS, lacked the option for same-sex relationships, a social media campaign called Miiquality called on Nintendo to include the option in the game. Nintendo of America responded with a rather cold statement , saying that the game ""was intended to be a whimsical and quirky game"" that was ""absolutely not trying to provide social commentary.""

"Haunted Chocolatier Progress Isn't Being Affected By Stardew Valley Updates, Creator Says","It's been sometime since Haunted Chocolatier , the next game from Stardew Valley creator Eric Barone, received an update, but that doesn't mean the project and its progress have stalled. That's according to a new update from Barone himself, who provided a short post on the game's website to address some speculation around his focus on the game, its current progress, and rumors of a 2030 release date. In the post, Barone explains that he's been very productive on Haunted Chocolatier lately, and that the game is taking longer to bring together than expected. He concedes that it was likely announced too early, with the first trailer debuting in 2021, but that he had reasons for making that call, too.

Huntdown: Overtime Looks Like An '80s Action Movie In Video Game Form,"Easy Trigger Games and Coffee Stain Publishing have announced Huntdown: Overtime, a roguelite prequel to their 2020 run-and-gun action game Huntdown . The game directly follows the origins of John Sawyer, one of the playable characters in Huntdown, as he's transformed into a cyborg bounty hunter. Players fight through the game's cyberpunk criminal underworld in procedurally generated runs, and upgrade John Sawyer with new cybernetics after each death. That reveal trailer and the game at large are intentionally going for a tone that Art Director Tommy Gustafsson says is inspired by ""the badass spirits of '80s cinema,"" according to a press release.

"Return To Silent Hill Director Wanted A Longer Film, Hopes Fans See It Someday","Return to Silent Hill director Christophe Gans has confirmed that an alternate, longer cut of the film exists, but there's no guarantee this version will see the light of day. That's according to a fan who attended the Return to Silent Hill premiere and a Q&A session with Gans ( via Reddit ), who says the filmmaker originally submitted a longer version of the movie. Gans described this cut as longer and allowing the story more room to breathe, but he was instructed by his producers to trim the movie down to two hours. This version also gave a key character from Silent Hill 2--the game the movie is adapted from--more screen time and a death scene. According to the fan, ""Gans said he struggled to find the right place for it in the edit,"" and it's unclear if the scene will appear in a potential director's cut version of Return to Silent Hill. The film has gotten off to a poor start at the box office, grossing just $3.2 million from US theaters . This pales in comparison to the opening US weekends for 2006's Silent Hill ($20.2 million) and Silent Hill: Revelation ($8 million), and reviews have not been kind . Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"""What would I change if we could go back?"" Inside Blizzard's big plan to put Overwatch back on top","Overwatch 2 had a problem. It's a problem a lot of live service games have, to be fair.

This is Mio: Memories in Orbit. This game is Mucha-like hair billowing in zero G. It's a cluster of pearls and twills of off-cut brass twisting around the chill reaches of outer space. It's the future, or perhaps the weird cybernetic past, inspired by Art Nouveau. It's warm metal forming stamens and petals and entire gardens. The whole thing's gorgeous and sad and filled with visual cleverness. Read more"

Hollow Knight Reportedly Shadow-Dropping On Switch 2 Today,"Ahead of today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, it looks like a Switch 2 edition of the original Hollow Knight might be on the way. The certifications board PEGI has rated the game for the console, but the exciting part here is that a release date of February 5, 2026, is mentioned in the text. This has led to speculation that Hollow Knight is being set up for a shadow drop today. Developer Team Cherry had previously mentioned that a Switch 2 edition of Hollow Knight was in development, with high frame rate modes, options for higher resolutions, and other graphical upgrades. As an added bonus, the studio confirmed that players who already own the Nintendo Switch version of Hollow Knight will get the Switch 2 Edition for free when it launches. Hollow Knight is also being updated across all platforms, with new features added and any lingering bugs squashed. PC players have already had a chance to preview these changes through a new public beta branch of Hollow Knight, available for testing on Steam and GOG. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Who knows, but Lego says that this kit is designed for both play and display. Additional sets will roll out in 2027, but there's no word yet on what fans can expect.

Sony Reports Strong Performance Of First-Party Games As Console Sales Drop,"Sony is the latest games company to release its earnings for Q3 2025, and unlike other players in the industry, the PlayStation manufacturer has come out surprisingly well. Where other companies are feeling the pressure from component shortages and dropping hardware sales, Sony's games segment results were lifted by strong first-party game sales and subscription revenue. Sony isn't immune to the problems the rest of the industry have faced in the last year, reporting a 4% decrease in sales largely impacted by lower than expected console sales through the holiday season. This quarter was the first holiday period that didn't see console sales increase against the previous season , reporting the weakest holiday sales for PlayStation hardware in three years. Notably, the PS5 received a price hike during 2025, implemented across the US, UK, Europe, and Australia prior to the holiday season. Sony still sold a total of 8 million consoles during the quarter, bringing the PlayStation 5's lifetime sales up to 92.1 million. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Steam Machine's Release Date And Price Details Delayed Amid RAM, Storage Shortages","Earlier this month, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su said that Valve was on track to release its Steam Machine in the early part of 2026.

In a post on Steam , Valve notes that it had originally planned to release pricing and launch dates for all three products by now.

The company reiterated that it still plans to release these products in the first half of this year, but it hasn't been able to ""land on concrete pricing and launch dates that we can confidently announce."" Valve also shared that it will be sharing faceplate CAD, specs, and details with fans and manufacturers so that they will be able to make their own.

Former Mario Actor Shares His Joyful Approach To The Role,"For the better part of three decades, Charles Martinet was Nintendo's official voice for Mario.

While speaking with GamingBible , Martinet recalled that he crashed Nintendo's audition for Mario without knowing anything about the character or the Japanese video game publisher. ""I was simply told to start talking, and when you run out of things to say, that's your audition,"" said Martinet. ""I didn't want to do an Italian plumber sounding gruff, mean and nasty or scary to children, like a Mafia member. I didn't know whether the audience would have children in it, but I have a principle of comedy of always being kind. I thought to myself that I'll do something much more silly and fun. I didn't know anything about video games, so I just made things up about food and started talking."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"Amid Fan Concerns About Metroid Prime 4's Sales, Nintendo Provides Some Clarity","Nintendo's most recent earnings report delivered a routine update to its list of games that have sold at least one million copies by the end of 2025. A conspicuous absence was Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, which led to hand-wringing among fans of the series. However, the game has now reached that sales milestone, but only when combining its performance across Switch and Switch 2. That's according to reporter Stephen Totilo, sharing the tidbit in an X post and citing a Nintendo representative. It's unclear if Metroid Prime 4, which released on December 4, reached that figure by December 31 (as with other games in the earnings report) or if that includes sales through January. Following some consternation about neither the Switch nor Switch 2 versions of Metroid Prime 4 (Dec. 4) making Nintendo's million-seller list for the period ending Dec 31, a Nintendo rep told to me today that combined sales of those 2 versions have in fact passed a million copies pic.twitter.com/moCzzpb1bd — Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo) February 4, 2026 It might be somewhat comforting news for Metroid diehards, many of whom were spelling doom and gloom for the Prime subseries and the Metroid IP as a whole. As a point of comparison, the Switch 2 Edition of Pokemon Legends: Z-A reached 3.89 million units sold, making it to Nintendo's top-selling Switch 2 software list . At the same time, the version on the original Switch hit 8.41 million units, totalling 12.3 copies. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Players Killed 5.4 Million Enemies While Drunk,"Today is the one-year anniversary of the release of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 , and developer Warhorse is marking the occasion by revealing some of players' misadventures as Henry of Skalitz in the Kingdom of Bohemia. According to the devs, players killed 5.4 million enemies while drunk. The Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 infographic was shared by Warhorse on X , and it states that players spared 97.5 million in the entire game. Some players must have felt at least a little mercy in their hearts, but it's a much smaller percentage compared to the 452.8 million enemies that were dispatched in the game. One year on from the release of #KCD2 and we don’t know about you, but we’re still hungry. Here’s to everyone who’s joined the adventure, thank you. We wouldn’t be here without you! 🩵 pic.twitter.com/ZzxPPxAbsG — Warhorse Studios (@WarhorseStudios) February 4, 2026 We can probably give players the benefit of the doubt for most of those slayings. While the game gives players leeway to choose their own path for Henry, we'd like to believe that most of them aren't hacking up innocent NPCs. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Overwatch Team Is ""Not Comfortable"" Releasing AI-Generated Content, But Blizzard Is Open To Experimenting","Overwatch game director Aaron Keller has stated that developer Blizzard has no intention of releasing AI-generated content in the game, with the company instead aiming for the hero shooter to have a ""handcrafted"" feel to it. At the same time, Blizzard president Johanna Faries outlined the company's overall approach to AI, saying the technology holds many possible benefits. ""We don't want to put AI-generated content out in front of players. That's just not something that we're comfortable doing. We want this to feel like a handcrafted universe, and it is a handcrafted universe,"" Keller told GameSpot.

"Goodbye Overwatch 2, Hello Overwatch: The Story-Driven, ""Forever Game"" Blizzard Promised Is Finally Here","Less than four years after its release, Overwatch 2 is dead. Well. Kind of.

"Overwatch Kills Its First Character, But That Won't Stop You From Playing As Them","As Overwatch 2 continues to evolve--even dropping the ""2"" entirely and just going as ""Overwatch"" from here on out--there's the question of what happens to its characters. Going forward, Overwatch plans on putting story first and foremost, and a big part of heroic fantasy is the conflicts between good and evil and how those conflicts lead to losses or setbacks on both sides. And while storylines like that may be in Overwatch's future, these developments won't ever reflect in the playable roster. ""There [are] no plans to remove any characters from the roster depending on what may happen to them,"" associate game director Alec Dawson told GameSpot. ""But, I think, one thing that's really important to us is to be in lockstep with what's going on with the story throughout the year, whether it be our maps, whether it be events going on, whether it be our heroes, to make sure that they are reflected in what's happening there too."" This sounds in line with what we've seen in other hero shooters that have stories going on in the background of the matches-- Rainbow Six Siege has gone through several large shifts, for example, moving away from its counter-terrorism narrative in February 2019 to tell a military simulation sport fantasy, and then returning to the original counter-terrorism throughline several years later. The playable roster of the tactical shooter only grew during those developments, but the framing of matches and the types of new Operators, maps, and skins added in each season dramatically transformed to reflect a new narrative direction.

"Overwatch Is Getting Five New Characters, Here's A First Look At What They Do","Several big changes are coming to Overwatch in what is easily the game's most substantial update so far. On top of a name change, an unexpected pivot to a narrative-driven format, a seriously adorable collaboration, major UI updates, and more, five new characters are coming to Overwatch to help kick off The Reign of Talon, Season 1 on February 10. That's right: Five . Fortunately, this new lineup includes a tank, two support characters, and two damage characters, meaning every player will get the chance to test out a new hero (or nefarious Talon agent) if they so choose. That said, even game director Aaron Keller told GameSpot this large influx of characters will inevitably lead to balance issues --and that's without considering how overwhelming it can be to to play a new character you're unfamiliar with. With that in mind, here's a quick rundown of Overwatch's new characters--Emre, Domina, Mizuki, Anran, and Jetpack Cat--to help you familiarize yourself with them ahead of their debut. Emre - Damage Let's kick things off with the most beginner-friendly hero of the group, Emre. Those of you who are tuned into Overwatch have probably been expecting Emre, as this Overwatch-turned-Talon agent has been teased and alluded to for literal years. After playing a match as him last week, I'm happy to report that he was well-worth the wait. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Yes, Overwatch Characters Have Been Getting Sexier, But Not For The Obvious Reason","If you've noticed Overwatch's characters getting progressively sexier over the years, you're not alone, though Blizzard said there is an explanation for it aside from thirsty gamers. When Overwatch first launched in 2016, part of its appeal was its wide-ranging roster of characters of all shapes and sizes, ranging from a talking gorilla to a robotic monk. Characters like Zarya and Mei broke the mold of what many players were accustomed to seeing from female characters. In 2026, while there is still the occasional oddball character (like Venture or the upcoming Jetpack Cat ), many of Overwatch's newer heroes, like Freja, Vendetta, Wuyang, and Juno, as well as many of the new heroes coming in Overwatch 2026 Season 1, are all what society would label as more conventionally attractive. Usually, they are tall, skinny, and fit. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Overwatch Director Says Upcoming Changes Will Upset The Game's Balance: ""There's No Getting Around That""","Overwatch 2, now renamed simply Overwatch , is undergoing some big changes , with a new seasonal model focused on telling continuous year-long stories. As part of the soft relaunch, Blizzard is coming out strong with five new playable characters, substantially increasing the roster much more than usual at one time. That is bound to have an impact on the meta-game, and Blizzard is well aware. ""It's going to upset the balance of the game. There's no getting around that. There's something very exciting about it though,"" Blizzard's Aaron Keller told GameSpot. ""I think what we see with Overwatch is that our players do acclimate to change into new heroes fairly quickly. At the highest levels, it might just be a few days. They could have a handle on these new heroes that quickly and start developing metas for them."" Those five new characters include one new Tank (Domina), two DPS (Emre, Anran), and two Support (Mizuki, Jetpack Cat). That reflects the team-comp requirements in Overwatch 2, which is a major way that it differentiated itself from the looser restrictions of the first game. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Overwatch Is About To Reach Peak Cute With Sanrio Hello Kitty Collab,"Overwatch is about to get a whole lot cuter, as adorable skins based on Sanrio characters like Hello Kitty and Cinnamoroll will be the hero shooter's first collaboration for 2026. The collab begins the same day as Overwatch 2026 Season 1 on February 10 and will last through the February 23. There are six skins in total, with many of the game's more popular female characters represented (plus Lucio). Despite Overwatch adding an actual cat hero , they are sadly not receiving a collab skin. The six skins and heroes receiving them are: Juno: Hello Kitty Kiriko: Cinnamoroll Mercy: Pompompurin D.Va: My Melody Widowmaker: Kuromi Lucio: Keroppi While some Overwatch collabs see the game's heroes literally transform into iconic characters from another IP, these are a little less extreme. Juno, for example, is not literally Hello Kitty, but is rather wearing a Hello Kitty-themed outfit. Each skin is more inspired by their respective Sanrio character rather than being an exact copy of them. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Overwatch Is Finally Getting A Cat Hero, A Decade After Inception","Overwatch 2026 Season 1 will introduce five new heroes, among them a jetpack-piloting cat more than 10 years in the making. The matter-of-factly named Jetpack Cat is a new support hero joining the Overwatch roster on February 10, and they come with an impressive assortment of utility abilities. The Lifeline ability transforms the jetpack into transport mode, allowing Jetpack Cat to tow and heal an ally. Purr activates a healing aura and knocks back enemies, while Frenetic Flight allows for increased acceleration. Jetpack Cat's Ultimate ability, Catnapper, sees the feline dive towards the ground, knocking down surrounding enemies and tethering the nearest opponent to the jetpack. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Overwatch Is Dropping The 2 And Launching A New ""Story-Driven Era""","Overwatch 2 is now just Overwatch, with Blizzard finally dropping the ""2"" it added to its hero shooter back in 2022. Blizzard's shooter first launched in 2016, only to undergo a free-to-play transformation in 2022 that saw a 2 added to the name and a shift to a 5v5 format, alongside a visual refresh to its maps and heroes. While cosmetics and unlocks from the original Overwatch carried over to the ""sequel,"" Overwatch otherwise ceased to exist, replaced by Overwatch 2. The name change doesn't mean that Overwatch 2 is suddenly reverting back to the exact gameplay of the 2016 game. Instead, it coincides with the launch of Overwatch 2026 Season 1 and what Blizzard is calling a new ""story-driven era,""--one defined by yearlong narratives. Overwatch's yearlong story will last six seasons, with a new story arc beginning in Season 1 of 2027. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
One Of Last Year's Most Underrated Games Is Getting An Unexpected Spin-Off,"Sunderfolk remains one of the most underrated games from 2025, and we've now learned that Secret Door and Dreamhaven are making a roguelite spin-off titled Shadowstone. Released in April 2024, Sunderfolk is a cooperative tactics RPG where players use their phones to guide a party of cute animal creatures through different combat encounters. While its release was drowned out by the launch of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, and the fact that it required a phone to play, it's still a really good time for fans of digitized tabletop games . Now, Secret Door is remixing Sunderfolk's world and assets for a cooperative roguelite. Shadowstone features a hexagonal grid, card-based abilities, and cooperative play like Sunderfolk, and takes place in its Sunderlands setting. Unlike Sunderfolk, it's structured as a run-based roguelite where players fight through tactical encounters, upgrading their spells along the way. It also has a generally darker aesthetic and tone.

At Least Borderlands 4 Works On This Handheld Console,"Development on the Switch 2 edition of Borderlands 4 has been ""paused"" for the foreseeable future, but if you're aiming to play it on the go, the Steam Deck might just be the best option. Developer Gearbox has announced that Borderlands 4 is now Steam Deck Verified, which, according to Valve, means that the game will work on the handheld gaming PC without a user needing to fiddle with manual settings--but you still can, if you want. Digging deeper, this means that Borderlands 4 meets several requirements from Valve to be Steam Deck Verified, including a default resolution of 1280 x 720 and full controller support. Valve doesn't list performance as a factor beyond a brief mention of ""good"" default settings, but overall, Borderlands 4 should run similarly to its Windows counterpart. It's worth noting that games that have received a Steam Deck Verified label can still run poorly on the handheld, with notable examples being Mortal Kombat 1 and God of War shortly after release. These games still run well most of the time, but they do suffer from performance issues. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Valve's Steam Machine Is Still Coming In Early 2026, According To AMD","Valve's second attempt at launching its Steam Machine is still set to happen in early 2026, according to AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su. In an AMD earnings call , Su specifically mentions support for Valve Steam Machine, which will make use of an AMD processor. ""From a product standpoint, Valve is on track to begin shipping its AMD-powered steam machine early this year,"" Su states, stopping short of giving an exact timeframe. Early 2026 does align with what Valve suggested during the announcement of the Steam Machine, but since then, the company hasn't provided any updates on availability or pricing. The PC hardware landscape has, however, drastically changed since, with RAM and storage pricing exponentially increasing and potentially having an impact on numerous hardware launches for the foreseeable future.

Helldivers 2's Killer Robots Are Building Their Own Death Star And It's Our Fault,"A new twist in the ongoing saga of Helldivers 2 has emerged, as the Automatons have managed to steal the plans for Super Earth's Not-A-Death-Star space station . With the planet at risk of being annihilated by a replica of the planet-destroying symbol of peace, players are being mobilized to head to the home planet of the Automatons, Cyberstan. Do you want to know more? Fortunately, players will be getting some much-needed heavy firepower for when they return to the planet: the new Bastion Tank , which is teased in the trailer below. The assault vehicle is capable of carrying up to four Helldivers, and the 120mm cannon packs a punch. Each seated player has a role to play--driver, gunner, and two passenger seats to cover the flanks--so teamwork is essential. Even if you run out of ammo, you can use it as a makeshift Automaton-flattening machine for as long as its thick armor holds up in battle. There's also a new Premium Warbond to unlock weapons from this month, so a combination of laser-firing shotguns, sphere-shields, and explosive hammers will give Helldivers a fighting chance on the Automaton's home planet. Cyberstan was introduced in the very first Helldivers game, and this is one of several nods to the 2015 top-down shooter that has surfaced in Helldivers 2. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
New Management Sim Lets You Climb The Corporate Ladder And Sell Your Soul,"Do you have a disregard for people? Are you willing to use cutthroat tactics to climb the corporate ladder and temporarily satisfy shareholders by burning through employees? Then you might have what it takes to become a CEO--or at the very least--a winner in Manifesto. Developer Breakpoint Games describes it as a management sim that's all about ""burnout, layoffs, and making sh*tloads of money."" Just like the real world of Big Business, Manifesto will challenge players to put aside their feelings and become the problem as they work to survive corporate culture. The game has a very on-the-nose feature: It revolves around hiring employees, working them to the bone, and then burning them out to make extra profit as you chase increasingly impossible sales targets. Fortunately, you can juice the numbers with unlockable power-ups and by making unethical decisions to keep the sales flowing. Gallery Breakpoint Games says that Manifesto is merely a video game and that people shouldn't read between the lines because there's ""zero chance"" that it's a commentary on the mass layoffs that have regularly hit the gaming industry over the last couple of years. While the PC game doesn't have a release date yet, you can try out a demo for it on Steam. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"New Xenoblade Game Is On The Way, Voice Actor Seemingly Reveals","The chances of an upcoming Xenoblade announcement just leveled up, thanks to a listing by the voice actor for KOS-MOS in Xenoblade Chronicles 2 . Caitlin Thorburn apparently updated her Spotlight page with a credit for a Xenoblade Chronicles game in 2026. The Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit highlighted Thorburn's possible spoiler for a new Xenoblade game, which was first spotted by Famiboards . Thorburn's page notes her role as KOS-MOS once again for ""Xenoblade Chronicles."" This could mean Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is receiving a Definitive Edition--similar to the Xenoblade Chronicles X remaster that was released last year. Before that, Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition arrived in 2020 for Switch. Considering it's been almost nine years since Xenoblade Chronicles 2 launched, it obviously wouldn't be new to see Nintendo and developer Monolith Soft revisiting the RPG. However, Thorburn's listing is vague enough that it's possible a new entry for Xenoblade Chronicles is on the way--whether that's 4 or a sequel to X. There's always the possibility that it's for a crossover game like Xenoblade Warriors or just a mistake entirely by the voice actor, too. Last but not least, KOS-MOS also appears in the Xenosaga series , so something new with that franchise could be in play. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"Fallout Series Countdown Doesn't Lead To Fallout 3 Remaster, Like Fans Hoped","The second season of Amazon's Fallout series concluded yesterday, and with it the mystery behind the countdown timer on the show's official website. And as you might expect, it's not led to anything as exciting as some were hoping for. There was strong speculation online that the countdown would end with the announcement (and in some more hopeful corners, the release) of remasters for either Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas , neither of which transpired yesterday evening. Instead, fans of both the games and show were treated to recreation of one of New Vegas' most iconic locations: the Lucky 38 casino penthouse , home to Robert House, before the bombs dropped. Like other markers on the map on the official site, this is a simple but interesting interactive look at some of the popular locations from the show, with Vault 33 and Caswennan featuring previously. It's not clear why this location in particular warranted a countdown for several weeks, especially since it's a location that debuted in the show several episodes ago already.

You Can Dig Out Your Nintendo Labo VR Kit To Play Virtual Boy On Switch Online,"While playing Virtual Boy games on Nintendo Switch Online will require a pricey peripheral, you may already have something that lets you play them. More specifically, the Nintendo Labo VR Kit has gotten new functionality nearly seven years after its release. Nintendo Treehouse staff member Corey Olcsvary revealed this to GamesBeat at a recent press event. He explained that Nintendo isn't promoting this functionality as it's no longer selling new Nintendo Lab VR Kits. It's the cheapest way to experience this new Nintendo Classics catalog, at least if you haven't thrown out or given away your Nintendo Labo products. If you don't remember Nintendo Labo VR Kit , it was part of a line of funky peripherals Nintendo released early on in the Switch's lifespan. They were all made of cardboard, had to be put together by the player, and had functionality with some exclusive games. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

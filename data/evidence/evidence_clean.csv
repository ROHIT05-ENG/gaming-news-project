"""What would I change if we could go back?"" Inside Blizzard's big plan to put Overwatch back on top","Overwatch 2 had a problem. It's a problem a lot of live service games have, to be fair. It wasn't particularly exciting any more. It had a chance at launch a few years ago to excite people, to create a wave of momentum to surf thereafter, but it floundered, beset as it was with identity problems and a misguided obsession with PvE, which sounded lovely on paper but never really worked in practice. Plenty of good work was done since on the game but most people outside of Overwatch 2 don't care - or don't know, because they're not looking anymore. They've moved on, they're playing other things. Incremental updates weren't enough to turn their heads. As far as many people were concerned, Overwatch 2 was yesterday's news, been and gone. How, then, does Blizzard make people care again?

Nioh 3 review,"The Nioh series isn't exactly known for its nuance: there is good and evil, strong and weak, and little in-between. From feuding clans to the machinations of political elites, this binary is at the heart of everything in Team Ninja's pseudo-historical canon. Nioh 3 takes this black-and-white worldview and applies it to the feuding Tokugawa brothers at the start of the Seventeenth Century. Your character, Takechiyo, is good: noble, just, proper . Your brother, a bitter little rat tempted by ancient powers beyond his understanding (of course), is evil. His desire for power and notoriety is so distinct, in fact, that it has somehow summoned a supernatural 'crucible' from the darkest reaches of space-time, and this consuming chaos is so profound, it has managed to seep into four major eras of Japanese history. Uh oh! Read more"

"As Highguard stumbles out the gate after weeks of criticism, are we being too hard on live service games?","Highguard's launch this week would've probably passed by largely unremarked if it wasn't for its appearance at last year's The Game Awards . Unusually for a game with no prior hype or obvious pedigree, it featured as the show's big ""and finally"" reveal, immediately subjecting it to intense, and slightly bewildered, scrutiny. After that, even as hard facts on the game remained scarce, it continued to draw scorn, purely for the sin - or so it seemed - of being yet another live-service game. There's plenty more to say on Highguard specifically now it's out, but its arrival this week got us talking about the live service curse - the intense skepticism and innate ill-will that seems to accompany every announcement of a new contender, even before they've had a chance to prove themselves. So this week's Big Question for us and then you - are we being too hard on live-service games? Read more"

"Next Xbox Console Will Feature Epic Games Store ""On Day One""","The launch window for the next generation of consoles is still unknown, but when it happens, Epic Games plans to have its store on one of the major systems on ""day one."" According to Epic's Steve Allison, Microsoft has already conveyed that the Epic Games Store is welcome on the new Xbox console. ""We definitely plan to be on the new hardware for Xbox,"" Allison told Game File . ""Because, unless their policy or stance on it changes, they are telling us they're going to welcome that. And we're going be there, like, on day one. That will probably require us to build in whatever their requirements are, some sort of software to support that."" If that goes forward, it could change the fundamental way that console players purchase digital games. PC gamers are able to use any digital marketplace, but Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have their own proprietary gaming outlets. It's been a closed ecosystem through the current console generation. Adding Epic Games Store to the next Xbox would essentially be inviting players to spend money at a rival to the Xbox store that would have otherwise gone to Microsoft. It could also lead to pricing wars, if games available on both storefronts are cheaper on the other outlet. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Diablo 4 Next Class Looks To Have Leaked, And It's The Opposite Of Paladin","The second playable class coming in Diablo 4's Lord of Hatred expansion looks to have leaked, revealing a new spellcaster class never-before-seen in the series. A datamine of the Diablo 4 Season 12 public test realm (via Reddit ) has revealed files that make reference to a Warlock class. Complementing those file names is also datamined artwork that shows a dark spellcaster class alongside Lord of Hatred's other (already playable) class, the Paladin . Not much else is known about the Warlock, but the leaked artwork shows a man holding a sinister-looking sword and harnessing some evil-looking-red magic to conjure a massive demonic fist. Assuming Warlock is the new class, it will join a growing roster of recent classes that have never been featured in a previous Diablo game. Previous new additions include the Vessel of Hatred expansion's Spiritborn class and classes like the Blood Knight and Tempest from Blizzard's free-to-play mobile spin-off Diablo Immortal .

"Highguard Gets Another Major Update With New Hero, New Map, Ranked Mode, And More","To say Highguard has had a rocky start would be putting it lightly, but studio Wildlight Entertainment is not giving up on its embattled multiplayer shooter so easily. The first of Highguard's major planned updates drops on February 2, less than two weeks after the game launched, bringing with it a new map, new playable Warden, a ranked mode, and plenty more. The Season 2 update was revealed at launch as part of Highguard's ambitious 2026 roadmap , and Wildlight has it ready to go right at the start of its promised update window. The biggest new addition in this update is new Warden Ekon, who joins the eight Wardens already on Highguard's roster. Instead of riding a mount into battle, Ekon is a shapeshifter who turns into a powerful direwolf, boasting higher speed than any of the game's mounts in order to run down mounted enemies. If you want to get wolfy without Ekon, Highguard has also added a brand-new wolf mount available for free to all players.

Nioh 3 - How To Get Summoner's Candles And How To Use Them,"Nioh 3 is a tough game, so you're almost certainly going to die more frequently than you might expect. When you're slain in battle, you'll drop your Guardian Spirit, which will also contain all of the Amrita and Soul Cores you've obtained since last visiting a shrine. If you die again, it's all lost for good. Knowing this, you'll need to safely return to your grave and claim your Guardian Spirit, or you may end up very disappointed to see all of that progress lost. Luckily, you can also use a Summoner's Candle to call your Guardian Spirit back with all of your Amrita and Soul Cores intact--if you have one. Summoner's Candles are a rare resource that isn't to be used in every instance of death. Saving them for the right moments, though, can make a world of difference and keep you from losing potentially hours of your hard-earned progression. So, if you want more opportunities to rescue your Guardian Spirit without all the risk, here's how to get Summoner's Candles in Nioh 3. Where to get Summoner's Candles Summoner's Candles can be obtained in a few different ways, including looting, defeating foes, or buying them from specific merchants. Here are the primary methods of getting your hands on some of these candles. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Nioh 3 - How To Get Yokai Teardrops,"You may spend most of your time in Nioh 3 beating down tough-as-nails enemies and bosses, but you'll also have some downtime to shop for various items and crafting recipes you'll need to help you keep doing so. As such, there are multiple types of currencies you'll encounter that are required for purchasing items from specific vendors throughout the game--and perhaps the most important of these is Yokai Teardrops. Yokai Teardrops are used to buy rare resources, Skill Texts, and Craft Guides from Sudama--those cute purple skull-wearing merchants you regularly encounter throughout Nioh 3's maps. Unfortunately, this currency can be hard to come by. If you want to know how to get more Yokai Teardrops, we'll give you some options below.

How To Emote In Nioh 3 And How To Open Nurikabe Walls,"You'll spend most of your time in Nioh 3 navigating perilous environments and challenging enemies.

Nioh 3 - How To Transmog And Change Character Appearance,"Look, challenging bosses and exploration are great, but part of the fun in any Soulslike game is customizing your character, armor, and weapons to suit your preferred aesthetic. What's the point in slaying your foes if you don't look cool doing it, right? That's where Nioh 3 's character creator and transmog (transmogrification) come into play, allowing you to change the appearance of your character and gear to ensure you're happy with your visual vibes. Below, we'll tell you where to access these features and how they work so that you don't have to spend another moment looking anything less than your best. How to transmog and change your character's appearance in Nioh 3 To access the transmog and character creator features in Nioh 3, you'll need to visit the Eternal Rift. This is the game's main hub, where you'll frequently go to speak with characters or deal with weapon upgrades at the Blacksmith, so it's accessible early in your adventure after completing the first Crucible. To access the Eternal Rift at any point, simply open your map and press the left stick . Once you arrive at the Eternal Rift, make your way to the northernmost building here. It's also easily identifiable by the large tree stump in the center of its bottom room. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
How Long To Beat Nioh 3,"The Nioh franchise has long been among the most punishing yet rewarding entries in the Soulslike genre, and Nioh 3 doesn't mess too much with that formula. However, this new outing from developer Team Ninja does have some fresh tricks up its sleeves, such as an open field design and a less linear mission structure that provides players with substantially more freedom in how and when they tackle missions. If you're interested in seeing what this third entry has to offer, you'll find a lengthy and difficult campaign ahead of you, as well as plenty of optional content to seek out that is all but certain to improve your chances of survival. Here's how long it takes to beat Nioh 3. How long to beat Nioh 3 How long it takes to beat Nioh 3 will depend largely on how well you adapt to its frenetic combat and immensely demanding boss encounters. That being said, prioritizing the game's main content with the intent of simply reaching the credits should take an average of 30-40 hours for most players. Completionists, meanwhile, will be able to get even more from Nioh 3, as aiming to see everything the game has to offer can easily push the total playtime to 60-70 hours .

Assassin's Creed Multiplayer Game Reportedly Canceled,"Last month, Ubisoft announced significant cuts and the cancellation of six games, including the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake . At the time, there were no indications that Assassin's Creed franchise was in danger of losing any games in development, but a new report indicates that Assassin's Creed multiplayer game has now been canceled as well. According to French gaming site Origami , the project in question was given the codename Assassin's Creed League, and it would have allowed up to four players to work together on assassinations. AC League reportedly grew out of DLC originally created for Assassin's Creed Shadows , and may have also been set in the same era of Japanese history. The game was said to be in development at Ubisoft Annecy, the studio that created the multiplayer modes for Assassin's Creed Brotherhood , Assassin's Creed Unity , and Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag . Origami's report indicates that this cancellation is separate from the six titles that were swept away in January's cutbacks. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Baldur's Gate 3 Is Getting An HBO Series And At Least One Person At Larian Isn’t Happy,"All those steamy campfire scenes are about to get a whole lot hotter; According to Deadline , Baldur's Gate 3 is getting an HBO series. The show will reportedly take place after the game's events and is set to further expand its already robust-story. The Last of Us writer and director Craig Mazin is on board to create, write, produce, and showrun in what will be his second time adapting a critically acclaimed and seemingly universally beloved video game for television. Seemingly not attached to the series, however, is Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian. Following the announcement, it was reported that Larian has no involvement in the series . One of the studio's developers took to X to write, ""Imma bout to crash out on main,"" while another user asked , ""How are they allowed to do this if y’all didn’t give them the permission?"" Set in the Dungeon and Dragons universe, Baldur's Gate 3 follows a ragtag group of adventures forced to band together on a quest to remove their brain worms. No, really, that's the plot. Naturally things escalate from there--gods and cosmic forces get involved, as they are wont to do--but it all comes back to worms. However, what truly sets the game apart--and led to it being our Game of the Year back in 2023--is its excellent cast, sense of freedom, branching story, and the unparalleled agency it gave its players; all of this makes it an interesting choice for a television adaptation that will presumably be linear and could feature different actors in place of player's beloved party members.

What Does Nintendo Have Against Leon S. Kennedy?,"Near the end of this month, Resident Evil Requiem is coming to Switch 2 and other platforms. But in today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase , we couldn't help but notice that fan-favorite Leon S. Kennedy was done dirty in Requiem preview. If Nintendo thought people wouldn't notice Leon wildly missing every shot, then it was greatly mistaken. Stormtroopers from the original Star Wars trilogy had better aim than Leon does in the video below. Now, we can understand Grace Ashcroft missing every shot she took. She's the inexperienced one. But Leon suddenly looks like he needs Resident Evil 4's Ashley Graham to come back and save him, which would probably look a lot like this fan-made edit. Nintendo may have nerfed Leon to keep the level of violence down in the Direct. Grace didn't get any successful shots off either. But that doesn't explain the crime against nature that Nintendo pulled with this Leon Amiibo design . Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Borderlands 4's First Paid Add-On Content Is Coming This Month,"Borderlands 4 players won't have to wait until March for the game's next story addition.

It also includes a themed Vault card with 24 cosmetics, and four rerollable pieces of gear that can be unlocked through gameplay. As part of a separate update arriving near the launch of Bounty Pack 2, Borderlands 4 players will gain access to Pearlescent gear, a new tier that's even more powerful than Legendary gear. A handful of Pearlescent gear pieces will be exclusive to players who own Bounty Pack 2. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Bethesda's New Switch Games Come With Great Or Terrible News For Physical Game Fans,"As revealed during the latest Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase , Bethesda and MachineGames' Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is coming to Switch 2. Unlike some other big releases, Indiana Jones will not be on a Game-Key Card. Bethesda has confirmed that the game will be released on a cartridge. However, some of Bethesda's other games will not be getting true physical releases on Switch 2. And yes, the game is on Game Card. #IndianaJones https://t.co/jJ0cTDKLLL — Bethesda (@bethesda) February 5, 2026 It sounds like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was a tight fit for Switch 2's cartridges, because certain things like the Polish-language version will need to be downloaded separately. Players who preorder the Switch 2 version will get The Last Crusade pack, which includes Indy's Traveling Suit outfit and his lion tamer whip, as seen in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The Switch 2 version doesn't include the DLC expansion, Indiana Jones and the Order of Giants . That standalone adventure brings Indy back to Rome, where he teams up with Father Ricci while following the history of Emperor Nero, the Cult of Mithras, and a hidden treasure that has a dark secret.

Microsoft Aiming To Launch Four Big Games This Year While Avoiding GTA VI - Report,"Xbox is gearing up for a busy 2026, as a new report states Gears of War: E-Day is planned for a fall launch--as is Fable --with both games trying to avoid Grand Theft Auto VI . The Verge reports that there is a concerted effort within Microsoft to release its ""four horseman"" within 2026, with each one representing a franchise that has been a driving force for the Xbox brand in the past. While a recent Xbox Developer Direct provided new looks at Forza Horizon 6 and Fable, Microsoft has yet to showcase Gears of War: E-Day meaningfully since its reveal in June 2024. Currently, Forza Horizon 6 is expected to release in May, while Fable has been given a Fall release window later into 2026. The report states that Microsoft is aiming to have Gears of War: E-Day launch in the same fall timeframe, while Halo: Campaign Evolved, which will bring the shooter franchise to PlayStation for the first time, is being prepared for a summer launch. Microsoft is reportedly aiming to avoid Grand Theft Auto VI's release in November as much as possible, which could affect the exact release dates for both Gears of War and Fable.

Ubisoft's Internal Town Hall Meeting Still Leaves Employees Concerned - Report,"As Ubisoft undergoes a massive shakeup that's impacting the well-being of its employees, the company's staff has said that a recent internal town hall meeting didn't assuage concerns about their futures. Ubisoft held an internal town hall meeting on February 4. According to a recording of the town hall sent to Insider Gaming and a dozen anonymous employees who spoke to the outlet, employee morale is sinking. They said that the meeting was ""an expert class"" in dodging questions as executives opted to sidestep inquiries and recycle statements around three key issues: the return-to-office mandate, headcount reduction intentions, and the five creative houses' creation. Speaking on the return-to-office mandate, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot reiterated that the decision was to improve employee morale and team collaboration. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Download the Epic Games Store Mobile app For now, only iOS users in the European Union can install the app, but the app is available worldwide to Android device users and they have a wider selection of games to choose from in comparison.

Horizon Hunters Gathering Expands Sony's Franchise Into Co-Op,"The Horizon universe is getting a little bigger as Sony and Guerrilla have revealed plans for a new co-op game, Horizon Hunters Gathering. The title is set in the same world as the two previous Horizon games, except now up to three players will be able to team up and take on the lethal machine creatures that overrun the land. In a post on Sony's official PlayStation site , Guerrilla noted that the events of this game are canonical, and that the ""story doesn't stop at launch."" Players will have the option to pick their favorite character from a roster of hunters, each of whom uses their own preferred weapons, tactics, and play styles. The game also utilizes a rogue-lite perk system that lets players customize their characters to better serve their preferences. Horizon Hunters Gathering will have a narrative campaign that will ""introduce new mysteries, characters, and threats."" Each of the playable characters has their own backstory and personal history that will be explored over the length of the game.

"Ghost Of Yotei Outperforms Ghost Of Tsushima, Sony Confirms","Sony has announced that the open-world samurai adventure sequel Ghost of Yotei has outsold Ghost of Tsushima during the comparable launch period and ""significantly"" contributed to the company's latest financial results. The company didn't provide an updated sales figure for Sucker Punch Productions' latest action-adventure game, but during an earnings call that was transcribed by VGC , Sony confirmed that Ghost of Yotei has ""exceeded the sales of the previous title in the same period of time."" In its first three days, Tsushima sold over 2.4 million units . About four months after its July 2020 release on PlayStation 4, Tsushima then went on to surpass 5 million sales , making it one of PlayStation's fastest-selling new IPs in a while. By comparison, Yotei sold 3.3 million copies one month after its October 2025 release on PlayStation 5. If Sony is saying that the sequel ""exceeded"" the sales of the original game in the same time period, then it's safe to assume that Yotei has dashed past Tsushima's 5 million-sales milestone. It remains to be confirmed if Yotei will reach the same sales figure as Tsushima, which has surpassed 8 million copies as of January 2022 . Continue Reading at GameSpot"

It's shaping up to be a wildly popular game--and preorders are now open if you know you'll be playing it later this year. Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream $60 | Releases April 16 This is the only version of Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream up for preorder.

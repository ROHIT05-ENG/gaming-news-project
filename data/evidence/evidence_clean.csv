Silent Hill: Townfall Will Skip Xbox Consoles At Launch,"Silent Hill f had a simultaneous debut last year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC. However, the next game in the franchise, Silent Hill: Townfall , appears to be skipping Xbox at launch. Konami's official Silent Hill: Townfall site only confirms the game's upcoming release on PS5 and PC. Although Konami didn't elaborate any further on the issue, it seems likely that Townfall will be a timed exclusive game like the Silent Hill 2 Remake . That game debuted in 2024 on PC and PlayStation 5 and took an additional 13 months before arriving on Xbox Series X|S. Like Silent Hill f before it, Townfall is taking place outside of the US. The new location is in a Scottish town called St. Amelia, which is where the game's new hero, Simon Ordell, finds himself after washing ashore at the beginning of the story. The game is set in 1996, and Simon's best tool to detect the monsters waiting for him is a portable TV that helps him decide whether he should run or if he should hide from the deadly creatures.

"Starfield 2.0 Won't Fundamentally Change The Game, Says Todd Howard","Last year, Bethesda promised Starfield players that the game will get a second DLC story and a major update. Some of Starfield's new features have already been shown during a closed-door preview . That fueled speculation about big changes coming to the game, but Bethesda boss Todd Howard has now shut down those Starfield 2.0 rumors. ""It is not Starfield 2.0,"" said Howard during a recent appearance on Kinda Funny (via Insider Gaming ). ""I've seen some of that, and for expectation setting--I think it's the kinda thing where if you like Starfield, we think you're going to love this. It's updates and things that change the game, not in an isolated way, but you know 'meta,' using outer space and things in ways that we haven't. But if Starfield is something that didn't connect with you right away, or you bounced off it, or found it boring in places, I don't think it's going to change that fundamentally. But if you're someone who loves Starfield and we think [you'll love it]. We're really happy with it."" Several rumors have suggested that Starfield is coming to PlayStation 5 , which Bethesda has yet to confirm. However, a recent leak suggests that Starfield's Switch 2 port has been either canceled or postponed. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Destiny 2's Major Shadow And Order Update Is Being Delayed And Renamed,"Bungie has officially confirmed that its next major Destiny 2 update, Shadow and Order, will be delayed over three months to allow for major revisions. The update was initially planned for March 3, just two days before Bungie's new shooter Marathon is set to launch . The Shadow and Order update, intended as a major addition to December's Renegades expansion , was announced all the way back in May last year as part of Destiny 2's Year of Prophecy roadmap . With the release date sitting so close to Marathon's and a lack of information from Bungie on the fast approaching update, the news of a delay comes as no surprise to most Destiny fans. Bungie's official announcement of the delay, which was posted to social media and Discord, doesn't make any mention of Marathon, and instead says that the update is being delayed due to ""undergoing large revisions."" The scope of the update will be expanded, will now include ""sizable quality-of-life updates,"" and will be renamed before it is released on June 9, 2026. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

The Elder Scrolls 6 Will Use An Upgraded Version Of Starfield And Skyrim's Game Engine,"Bethesda's Todd Howard has reaffirmed that The Elder Scrolls 6 will use Creation Engine 3, the latest version of the game engine that has powered most of the studio's previous games.

""We’ve spent the last several years bringing Creation Engine 2, which powers Starfield, up to Creation Engine 3, which is going to power Elder Scrolls 6 and beyond,"" Howard said. ""Obviously we do all of the rendering things. We're really happy with all of the new stuff that we're doing, but also world systems, loading, how we bring things into the world, [and] how we get that detail close to the camera immediately."" Creation Engine is the game engine that Bethesda created during the development of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.

"Switch 2 Game's ""Camera As Controller"" Mode Will Let You Harness A Baby's Superpowers","When Skybound Games' Goodnight Universe launched late last year, the Switch 2 version lacked the game's ""camera as controller"" mode to allow players to use their face and body to control the action. As of today, an update has been added to Goodnight Universe's Switch 2 port that will enable those controls. The game casts players in the role of Isaac, a six-month-old baby whose recollections are narrated to the player by Lewis Pullman, who portrays Isaac as an adult. What makes Isaac unique are his advanced intelligence for his age and his telekinetic abilities. Isaac can move objects with his mind, and the ""camera as controller"" mode lets players guide the action with their eyes. Skybound has also shared a guide to setting up the Switch 2's camera to get the best results out of Goodnight Universe. In addition to needing a well-lit space to play, players need to ensure that their faces are fully visible too. The setup will also ask players to blink, smile, and frown, as all three of those actions can be used to control Isaac's actions under specific circumstances. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"Bigfoot Has Been Found, And He's In Fallout 76","Few cryptids are better known than Bigfoot, and we know where he's going to be at the beginning of next month. Bethesda has teased the arrival of Bigfoot in the next season of Fallout 76 with a teaser video that resembles supposed real-world attempts to catch the creature on camera. Bigfoot is coming to a wasteland near you! The Backwoods update and Season 24 arrives March 3 in #Fallout76 pic.twitter.com/38m0Y22rcB — Fallout (@Fallout) February 17, 2026 Bigfoot will be a part of the Backwoods update when Fallout 76 Season 24 begins on March 3. However, this won't be Bigfoot's first appearance in the game. Bigfoot's footprints have been spotted in the Burning Springs update, and the character has randomly spawned during public events in the game. Judging from the video teaser, it appears Bigfoot will be more prominently featured going forward. Fallout 76 already has a large assortment of cryptids in the game, including the Jersey Devil, Mothman, Wendigo, Sheepsquatch, Blue Devil, and the Smiling Man. Since players can battle those creatures, it stands to reason that Bigfoot will be available as a miniboss fight as well. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

How To Open Locked Chests In Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined,"Doesn’t matter which one it is, if a game spends hours telling you you can break open everything not nailed down, if they start putting locks on things, you’re gonna take that Michael Jordan-level personally. Even in its newfangled Reimagined form, Dragon Quest 7 is no different, you’ll eventually start running into chests that won’t open, and what’s worse, because chests aren’t specifically color-coded here, you won’t know what key opens what kind of chest till you try to open it. While letting Maribel complain at them until they surrender their contents sounds like a grand idea on paper, we might suggest finding a few keys for these things might go a little easier. We’ll show you where you’re headed for these. The Thief Key So, in general, you’re gonna want to tackle as many of these chests as you can once you get access to their specific areas, since the time jump mechanic means some of these locations can be locked or blocked off if you progress a bit too far too fast. Fortunately, they’re all very much on your way through the main story. You’ll find the Thief Key when you’ve handled your business in Alltrades Abbey. Once you’re able to roam freely after taking down Cardinal Sin, head back to Pilgrim’s Perdition, and head to the weird little hostel at the north of town next to a well. The NPCs that were guarding the chest here will be gone, and you can grab the key in here. Even better, you can use it right away by opening the other chest in here for a Mini-Medal.

"Valve Wins Trial Against ""Patent Troll"" Inventor","A Washington jury has favored Valve in its lawsuit against the ""patent troll"" inventor Leigh Rothschild and a myriad of his associated companies for breaching a contract and violating a state patent protection law. According to reports by Bloomberg Law and PC Gamer , the US District Court for the Western District of Washington favored Valve on all counts as part of a lawsuit that dates back to July 2023. In a minute filed on February 17 and uploaded by Bloomberg Law , the count determined that Rothschild and his affiliates violated Washington’s Patent Troll Prevention Act and Consumer Protection Act, as well as breached the contract. Rothschild and Valve have a storied history, with the two being in and out of courts since at least 2016. The inventor has an assortment of patents, both granted and pending, under his name that extends to a broad array of fields, including barcodes and QR codes. Many of his companies deal in patents, too. For example, Rothschild Broadcast Distribution Systems (RBDS) owns patent US8856221B2 , which is a ""system and method for storing broadcast content in a cloud-based computing environment."" Valve obtained a ""perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide license"" for it and others in Rothschild's portfolio in 2016.

After chatting about the game's DNA, its evolution from a Black Desert Online prequel to a full-fledged project, and the density of the game's world for an hour, Powers was asked about whether the voices for the myriad characters you'll meet are performed by humans or not. ""I'm not going to criticize other games, but all of our voices are done by humans,"" he said.

The Most Competitive Swim Of Your Life Is Now A Video Game,"At some point in your life, you'll realize that you won the ultimate race, with the grand prize being your very existence.

All Roblox Star Fishing Star Locations,"Looking for a specific star to complete a quest? Chances are that you could be fishing in the wrong place, as some spots exclusively house certain types of star systems. This Roblox game isn’t a massively complex one to play, but it does require a lot of grinding for cash, quests, and other equipment to maximize your catch. However, even though fishing is relatively painless, particularly if you opt to craft rings from Mythic and higher rarity stars, you may find that there are a handful of them that require one of the two temporary-spawning locations: The Eye and Negative Galaxy. You’ll see prompts when these areas appear, and, as of right now, they’re the hot spots for the rarest stars. Incidentally, potions can give you a bit of a boost, and our list of Star Fishing codes can give you a few gems to help you get started. Star Fishing star locations Here are all the spawning points for every rarity in Star Fishing. The odds of fishing labels are slightly misleading, but what it essentially means is that if you had a base rod with normal luck, these combine to give you the odds of retrieving that star. The higher your luck stat and the better the rod, the more likely you’ll discover Rare or Epic stars more frequently. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

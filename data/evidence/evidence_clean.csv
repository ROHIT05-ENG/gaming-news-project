Resident Evil Requiem Director Promises That The Game Doesn't Hold Back On Gore,"Resident Evil Requiem , like prior games in the Resident Evil series, is going to be a very violent and gory game, complete with decapitations, bodies been torn apart, and plenty of viscera. Previously, certain games in the Resident Evil series have received cuts for the Japanese market, or received two different versions. But for Requiem, the development team at Capcom wanted to make sure that everyone was playing the same version, while also pushing the game's gore to the limits. In a media briefing for Japanese press, which was attended and translated by Automaton , director Koshi Nakanishi spoke to the level of gore in the upcoming game, and the necessity of hitting a certain level of violence to make the experience engaging. “Since the Resident Evil 4 remake, we’ve gone with releasing a CERO Z version only, so this time we’re basically following that same approach,"" Nakanishi says.

"Live-Service Games' Success Depends On Limiting ""Churn"" More Than Huge Launches, Analysts Say","New research suggests that the biggest challenge facing live-service games today is not getting players in the door, but keeping them there. As the market becomes increasingly crowded, long-term success now depends far more on retention than on splashy launches or expensive marketing campaigns. For players, this explains why so many online games feel like they are constantly asking for your attention. According to Ampere Analysis , a London-based market research firm, most live-service games like Fortnite, Roblox, and Apex Legends experience heavy churn, with large portions of their audience dropping off within months. That makes it difficult for even well-known franchises to sustain momentum if players do not feel compelled to return regularly. In that environment, attracting new players can be costly and inefficient if the game fails to hold interest beyond the early hours. Instead, Ampere points to retention as the key driver of growth. Games that keep players engaged over time generate more value per player, rely less on paid advertising, and benefit from organic growth through friends and social platforms. Long-running hits like Fortnite and GTA Online demonstrate how consistent updates and evolving features can turn a game into a years-long habit rather than a short-term trend.

One Of Last Year's Best Games Gets A New Update As It Hits Big Player Milestone,"Last year, Dotemu released Absolum , a side-scrolling fantasy beat-'em-up game.

"The Witness, 10 Years Later, Still Refuses To Explain Itself","The Witness celebrated its 10-year anniversary on January 26, 2025. Below, we look back at its methodical approach of letting the player teach themselves. When The Witness launched at the end of January 2016, it felt willfully out of step with the rest of the industry. Big-budget games were growing louder and more cinematic with the likes of Watch Dogs 2, Mafia III, and Uncharted 4. None of those titles held their players' hands to an unnecessary degree, but clear objective markers ensured players were almost always aware of their next task. Jonathan Blow’s puzzle game arrived and couldn't have felt more different. There were no prompts, no text boxes, no explanations. You woke up on a serene island and were expected to quietly figure everything out on your own. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Valve Hit With New Lawsuit Over Steam Commissions,"Steam has been one of the dominant marketplaces for PC games for over two decades, but its parent company, Valve, is now facing a lawsuit that argues the commissions it charges publishers have given it a monopoly. As reported by Reuters , the case was originally filed in the United Kingdom in 2024, but it was only given approval to go forward by a tribunal earlier this week. The lawsuit is attempting to represent ""up to 14 million people"" in the UK who have purchased games or DLC through Steam since 2018. The argument at the heart of the case alleges that Valve has kept publishers from selling their games more cheaply on other platforms by setting contractual conditions. Essentially, Steam users who buy a game on that platform can only purchase DLC or additional content through Valve. The lawsuit contends that this locks in consumers to Steam rather than giving them options to go elsewhere. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

These Joy-Con Mouse Grips Make The Switch 2's Mouse Mode Better,"Mumba Mouse Grip For Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con $20 (was $24) See at Amazon One of the coolest features of the Switch 2 is its Joy-Con 2's mouse mode, adding PC-controls and functionality to the already verstile handheld. However, some users find the Joy-Con 2's thin design to be uncomfortable in mouse mode--and if that's you, you might want to check out the Mumba Mouse Grip for Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con . The ergonomic grips are designed specifically for mouse mode, adding some additional bulk and heft to better mimic using a standard PC mouse. Right now is a great time to grab a pair, as they're currently down to $20 (was $24) on Amazon. The set includes a pair of grips, one for each Joy-Con 2. Mumba Mouse Grip For Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con $20 (was $24) These ergonomic mouse grips slot easily onto the Joy-Con 2. Each grip is 73mm wide, 119mm long, and 41mm tall, adding an appreciable bit of size to the Joy-Con 2s, but they are still small and light enough for easy storage. The grips don't interact with the top half of the Joy-Con at all, so you'll still have easy access to the shoulder buttons. These are designed with zero-resistance glide in mind, so you won't need a mouse pad to use them. They also come with detachable wrist straps to keep the grip secure on your wrist or for storing them when not in use. See at Amazon Since the Nintendo Switch 2 launched in the summer of last year, plenty of games have launched with mouse functionality . Drag x Drive was designed specifically with mouse controls in mind, and the control scheme is great for shooters like Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, System Shock Remake, and Cyberpunk 2077, as well as strategy games like Civilization VII. Some RPGs, like Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster, use mouse controls, and even select retro titles on the Nintendo Switch Online service offer optional mouse support, like Mario Paint and Nobunaga's Ambition. The mouse controls are also great for navigating the Switch 2's home menu. More Nintendo Switch 2 Accessories The Switch 2 has dozens of other fun and useful accessories. With Nintendo Switch Online now offering N64 games, the 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth controller is the perfect way some of your old favorites. It sports the same color scheme as the original N64 controller, but does away with the original N64 gamepad's trident design in favor of a more streamlined, ergonomic style. And if you prefer to play your Switch 2 on the go in handheld mode, then the Gammeefy enhanced grip with Hall Effect sticks is worth a look, as it makes for a comfortable alternative to playing without one--plus the included Hall Effect thumbsticks are more resistant to the dreaded stick drift.

Court Ruling Involving Classic Game Could Have Wider Repercussions,"Runescape has been enjoying a resurgence of popularity, but a recent court ruling in the United Kingdom may have made it a landmark in the realm of video game property. Essentially, an appeals court has ruled that theft of in-game currency from RuneScape is also theft in the real world. Per IGN , the ruling came in the case of Andrew Lakeman, an ex-Jagex developer who is accused of stealing 705 billion gold--or approximately $750,000 in real-world funds--from 68 RuneScape players. Lakeman is also alleged to have sold this in-game currency for Bitcoin. The initial judge in Lakeman's case gave the defendant a favorable ruling by finding that the gold that was stolen had no actual value because the game can create an infinite amount. The Court of Appeal disagreed with the first judge's take and found that the in-game currency does have value, and that stealing it constitutes theft in the eyes of the law.

"Arc Raiders Has New 3-Strike Permaban System For Cheaters, But Not Everyone's Happy","Like most PvP games, Arc Raiders has suffered greatly from cheaters. Embark Studios has now detailed a new plan to help combat against those unsavory players, which includes a progressive ban that will eventually escalate to a permaban. Dying to cheaters in any game can feel frustrating, but the stakes feel even higher in a game like Arc Raiders, where dying means you lose your entire loadout and all the loot in your pockets. The recent increase in cheaters has been highlighted by several major streamers, and the developer has now responded by announcing a new punishment system for cheaters. Embark Studios has described this plan as a three-strike progressive ban system, where bans will progress from 30 days, then to 60 days, and finally to a permaban for repeat offenders.

MLB The Show 26's Cover Art Confirms Judgement Day Approaches,"A curious statement from developer San Diego Studio earlier this week teased that MLB The Show 26 wouldn't have a ""new cover athlete."" The cheeky message seemingly hinted that a baseball star already featured previously for the franchise was returning, and that is, in fact, the case. New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge will serve as the cover athlete on MLB The Show 26. The All-Star outfielder previously appeared on the box art for the sports series with MLB The Show 18.

Arc Raiders A Prime Specimen Quest Guide,"Arc Raiders sports quite a few quests that send you to Blue Gate, but most of them don't require you to break into a dangerous husk and make it back out alive.

All told, there are 17 different activities to play locally with friends. You can also jump online with the Game Room Plaza, allowing up to 12 players to duke it out in six different challenges. Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Target Preorder at GameStop The Switch 2 Edition also benefits from Toad Brigade Training Camp, which tasks you with completing increasingly difficult challenges. As you advance through the main game, new courses will unlock. And if you're new to the game, Assist Mode will teach you the ropes in a low-stakes environment. Folks who have grown tired of playing as Mario will be glad to know Rosalina will arrive as a playable character--and when a second player joins in, they'll get to zoom around as Luma. As mentioned above, those who own the Switch version of Super Mario Bros. Wonder can opt to upgrade to the Switch 2 version for $20. This also means you can save a few bucks by purchasing the Switch 1 version at a discount, then upgrading to the Switch 2 Edition via the eShop. The original Switch version of the game is often available online for less than its standard $60 MSRP--for example, it's currently available for around $53 at Amazon via multiple third-party listings. Adding the $20 Switch 2 Edition upgrade comes to $73 total, and while that only saves you about $7 compared to the Switch 2 Edition's $80 launch price, it's nevertheless a viable way to get the game at a discount.

Everything New In The Terraria 1.4.5 Bigger And Bolder Update,"Terraria 's Bigger and Bolder update, or Terraria 1.4.5, has been in the works for around three long years. Developer Re-Logic claims it's the final update, but given its track record of claiming the same for previous updates, it would come as no surprise if there are additional adjustments to the sandbox game in the future.

Alongside Dead Cells and Palworld crossovers, there are a host of other improvements including a crafting menu overhaul, new boulders, new boss weapons, and more.

When activated it will bounce between ores and chests while passing through blocks and not hurting the player. A Poo Boulder, because why not? A Boulder covered in Magma will also be added alongside a Boulder pet. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"GTA 6 Not Having A Physical Disc At Launch Wouldn't Be A Huge Deal, Analyst Says","A high-profile gaming analyst has reacted to the rumor that Grand Theft Auto VI may not have a physical-disc option at launch this November. To be sure, this is an unconfirmed rumor for now, and Rockstar has not commented on the situation. In any event, Matt Piscatella of Circana shared a quick-hit take on the rumor on social media. Without naming GTA 6 outright--but obviously referring to the hugely hyped game-- Piscatella wrote : ""I would say that the big game missing physical at launch would be an even bigger fart on the wind sales-wise than game key cards are now. But it really wouldn't be worth it. So, I won't say that."" Piscatella is clearly being cheeky here, but the takeaway seems to be that bypassing a physical edition for GTA 6 at launch wouldn't mean much in terms of the game's initial sales. The ""fart on/in the wind"" is an idiom that refers to something that would have little to no importance. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"Splatoon 3's New Update Adds Health Bars, Killstreaks, And Unexpected New Features","While Splatoon 3 might be over three years old and has since ended regular content updates, the game's latest patch, scheduled for January 29, adds some surprising features that might upend the meta. Version 11.0.0 of Nintendo's third-person shooter adds new mechanics and changes to existing abilities. The ""Flow Aura"" feature rewards players for killstreaks, granting speed and defense buffs while shooting ink around them for about 30 seconds. Additionally, a health bar will appear above enemies as you damage them. The SRL research team is proud to present new findings about Ver. 11.0.0! First up is the Flow Aura state. If you splat multiple opponents without getting splatted yourself you'll automatically ink the ground around you and your physical abilities will all be slightly improved. pic.twitter.com/H6I3KqbHaK — Splatoon North America (@SplatoonNA) January 27, 2026 The update also makes some changes to hitbox detection, shrinking the hitboxes for players when they're in swim form. To accommodate, hit boxes for short-range weapons are larger, which should incentivize players to engage opponents up close. Finally, those using the Stealth Jump gear ability will take slightly longer to Super Jump back into the map. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Tony Dalton Says Working On Intergalactic Is ""Like Nothing I've Ever Done In My Life""","Actor Tony Dalton, known for his roles in Better Call Saul and in the MCU as Jack Duquesne, will appear in Naughty Dog's next game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet , and now he's shared some more insight into working on the game and with director Neil Druckmann. Speaking with Culture Wave Media , Dalton said Druckmann enjoyed working with him on HBO's The Last of Us, where Dalton played Joel's father . Druckmann wanted to keep working with Dalton, so Druckmann pitched Dalton on Intergalatic. It's Dalton's first video game, so he didn't know what to expect, but he trusted Druckmann and signed on. ""It's crazy. It's like nothing I've ever done in my life. These guys are top of the line. You put on these skin tight suits with dots all over the place--all over your face and everything. They have a whole set. Huge, huge set. It's amazing,"" Dalton said of recording his parts for Intergalactic. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Geoff Keighley Says He Has No Financial Stake In Highguard: ""Absolutely Not""","One theory circulating online about the newly launched free-to-play fantasy shooter Highguard is that Geoff Keighley--the host and organizer of The Game Awards where the game was first revealed--has some kind of personal financial stake in the game or its developer. Keighley was asked straight-up recently if this was the case, and he replied , ""lol absolutely not."" It's been reported from multiple sources that Highguard studio Wildlight did not have to pay a penny to show the game at The Game Awards in December 2025. That's notable because of how expensive normal slots are at The Game Awards . What's more, Highguard was the final reveal of The Game Awards. These elements contributed to some people believing--based on no real evidence--that Keighley had some personal stake in the game and was promoting it heavily because of that.

Switch Online Leak Might Rule Out A Highly Requested GameCube Remaster,"A page on Walmart's website apparently let slip that two unannounced GameCube titles are coming to the Nintendo Switch Online library of classic games. Near the bottom of Walmart's Nintendo page (as first spotted by Nintendo Life ), a graphic advertising the Nintendo Switch Online paid membership includes box art for several retro games that are already available on the Nintendo Classics apps. Metroid Prime 2 and Pikmin 2, which Nintendo has not announced for NSO as of yet, are included in the image, which is still on the Walmart site as of this writing. Already on the Metroid subreddit , fans are lamenting that Prime 2 coming to Nintendo Classics appears to indicate that the 2004 title won't be getting a proper remaster , as the first game did for the Switch in 2021 . The conventional wisdom is that Nintendo wouldn't have a game on Nintendo Classics that it's already selling on the Switch, and we can point to a few cases that support or contradict this.

"Horses Was Successful Despite Steam And Epic Store Bans, But It May Not Be Enough","Developer Santa Ragione is reporting that its controversial indie horror game Horses sold 18,000 copies in two weeks. That was apparently enough to save the studio from financial ruin, but perhaps not enough to pay for production a second game. According to a statement released by the developers, Horses generated $65,000 in net revenue, which allowed Santa Ragione to repay its loans and pay the royalties it owed to Andrea Lucco Borlera, the author and creator of Horses. However, the income won't allow the team to immediately begin working on another game. ""This result is not enough to begin production on a new game,"" reads the statement. ""The money primarily covers obligations created by a prolonged end of development. If sales remain steady, we may be able to fund a new prototype in the future, but the team has had to, and will continue to, take other jobs and projects in the meantime. Reuniting everyone will not be easy, even if it is something we would love."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"

To turn up the heat on players, human and infected enemies are now smarter, more aggressive, significantly stronger, and more reactive to the players' actions. Volatiles may now even appear during the day in some of the Dark Zones, and players have far fewer resources to deal with them all. If that wasn't enough, there's a new super enemy, the Alpha Volatile. Techland calls it ""the most intelligent Volatile in the history of Dying Light."" It's even smarter than the traditional Volatiles and its heightened senses can track the player across the entire map unless they reach a safe zone. The Alpha Volatiles can be killed, but good luck trying to pull that off. At night, the player is the prey for this creature. Players can also get new finishing maneuvers, including one-handed blunt weapons and one-handed slashing weapons. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Preorders for the It: Welcome to Derry Limited Edition Steelbook initially sold out in hours, but it's back in stock at Amazon for $45 and Walmart for $57 .

Alternatively, you can buy Season 1 on other streaming platforms like Amazon Prime Video for $22 . Welcome to Derry holds an 80% on Rotten Tomatoes , and I think many longtime fans of King's legendary horror novel would say Season 1 was pretty great. HBO has yet to renew the series for a second season, but director Andy Muschietti has a three-season arc in mind. Season 1 tells the story of Pennywise's reign of terror in 1962. Season 2 would rewind the clock 27 years to Pennywise's previous feeding cycle in 1935, and Season 3 would be set in 1908. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Sosuy Motorized Coin Pusher Arcade Game Building Set (2,093 pieces) $61.74 (was $80) While kids will have fun playing with the Coin Pusher Arcade Game once the build is complete, they'll probably need an adult to help snap together its 2,093 pieces.

This is an awesome deal on one of the most acclaimed action film series, but the price cut ends until 11:59 PM PT, so you only have a few more hours to take advantage of the deal. Mad Max 5-Film Collection (4K Blu-ray) $49.49 (was $80) Set in a dystopian future where society has broken down in the wake of resource and water wars, the box set includes Mad Max, Mad Max: The Road Warrior, Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, Mad Max: Fury Road, and Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga. The slipcase also pays tribute to the film series, featuring artwork showcasing various images of the bandits and the vehicles that hunted down Max and Furiosa throughout each movie. This collection includes a curated selection of special features pulled from previous Blu-ray releases. You can sit down for several behind-the-scenes documentaries, deleted scenes, and featurettes that explore the chaotic world of the film series. What makes this edition special is that it is the only 4K Blu-ray box set to include the physical Black & Chrome editions of Fury Road and Furiosa. Both movies look stunning in black and white, as each film was re-graded to create striking images bereft of color. The only downside to this collection is that there are no special features included for Beyond Thunderdome.

Silent Hill F Producer Hints At Future Sequels Set Outside Of US,"Earlier this year, Silent Hill f became the first game in the series to ditch the small American town that the series was named for in favor of setting it in Japan decades earlier. That approach may be used again for future titles in the franchise, according to developer Motoi Okamoto. ""We believe we could perhaps take similar approaches with other cultures across the globe,"" Okamoto told Inverse through a translator. ""For example, in Central or South America, we could perhaps tap into the more local, shamanistic beliefs and see how that ties in. But we could also try to expand our horizons and look into other regions, like possibly Russia, Italy, or South Korea, because all those areas have their own unique types of belief systems. I believe that will be a gateway for us to expand our concepts further."" Okamoto appears to have put the most thought into the Central and South American locations, which he said have ""been affected by a lot of military governments and coups,"" before adding, ""There is a type of bravado and 'machismo' that comes from these political landscapes. There’s also the more folkloric angle coming from shamanism and local beliefs."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"

A 92-Year-Old Just Won A Tekken 8 Tournament,"For three decades, the Tekken series has brought players together as they control of some of the best fighters in the world. Now, a 92-year-old Japanese woman named Hisako Sakai has carved out her own legend in the King of the Iron Ring battles by winning a Tekken 8 tournament. As reported by Automaton , the tournament of senior citizen Tekken 8 players was put on by the Japanese eSports association Care. The mission statement of that organization is to ""create an environment in which the elderly can casually participate in eSports."" Care has been running tournaments since 2019 while treating them like a major event with livestreaming and official commentators. A video from the event can be seen below. Sakai made it all the way to the finals while playing as Claudio, when she went up against 74-year-old player Goro Sugiyama, who used Lili as his character.

Kinect's Revenge: Nex Playground Outsells Xbox Hardware In The US,"The conventional wisdom is that Kinect was an albatross on Xbox One, making the system more expensive at launch and taking away resource power. But now, over a decade later, the Kinect-like Nex Playground has outsold Xbox hardware for November in the US, according to Circana. Nex Playground came in third for hardware units sold last month, outpacing Xbox Series X|S. The only saving grace is that Xbox raked in more dollar sales, as Nex Playground retails for $250 but has been on sale for $200 over the holiday season.

Warner Bros. Urges Shareholders To Reject Paramount's Rival Bid For The Studio,"The battle for Warner Bros. may be down to Netflix and Paramount, but the studio has a clear favorite. Earlier this month, Netflix bid $82.7 billion dollars for Warner Bros., jilting Paramount in the process. Paramount responded with a hostile takeover bid of $108.4 billion . Now, Warner Bros. is urging its shareholders to reject Paramount's ""illusory"" offer. ""Following a careful evaluation of Paramount's recently launched tender offer, the Board concluded that the offer's value is inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on our shareholders,"" reads a letter to shareholders from Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., the chair of Warner Bros. Discovery's board of directors. Although Paramount's offer is higher, Warner Bros.' contends that Paramount's owners, the Ellison family, didn't offer a ""full backstop"" commitment to provide the money to cover its offer and that it can walk away from the transaction without paying any penalty. By comparison, Netflix and Warner Bros. have a $5 billion breakup fee if their deal fails to close or meet regulatory approval. Warner Bros. also contends that the proposed Paramount deal will not be approved by regulators. Regardless, Netflix isn't guaranteed to be approved either. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

One Of 2025's Best Games Looks Like It's Coming To Switch 2,"Down under may have just given us the down low on Dispatch coming to Switch and Switch 2. That's because the Nintendo storefront for Australia has listings up for the episodic game, revealing that the title is planned to launch January 29 on both Nintendo systems. There hasn't been an official announcement from Dispatch developer AdHoc Studio yet about Switch and Switch 2 ports. However, the official Nintendo eShop pages point to this being a matter of when, instead of if, Dispatch arrives on the hybrid consoles. So far, Dispatch is only available on PC and PS5. The Nintendo store listings note that there will be a free Switch 2 upgrade for Dispatch. That edition of the game sports ""enhanced resolution and improved frame rates"" and will take up an estimated 14.6GB of storage space.

In comparison, Dispatch costs $30 on Steam and PS5. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"The Last Of Us Co-Director: ""I Don't Like AI""","The Last of Us co-director Bruce Straley has shared his thoughts on using generative AI to aid in game development, saying the technology cannot ""grow and think for itself."" The technology ""just consumes, and tries to mimic what it's consumed,"" he told Polygon . ""That's the best it can do right now."" He also described generative AI as ""a snake eating its own tail."" One of the reasons why AI has been such a contentious issue in gaming is that not everyone defines it the same way. For his part, Straley said ""NPCs are AI"" and have been for decades already in gaming. Straley's new game, Coven of the Chickenfoot, has players taking on the role of Gertie, an elderly witch who works alongside a ""creature companion"" who can ""observe, learn, and evelopment new behaviors based on contextual situations.""

Hardware Sales In The US Just Had Worst Month In 30 Years,"Circana released its monthly sales report for November today, shining a light on how the North American video game business is performing. Hardware sales had a particularly difficult month, with sales falling 27%, from $949 million in November 2024 to $695 million in November 2025. November 2025 represented the lowest hardware spending total for a November month since November 2005 ($455 million). A total of 1.6 million game hardware units were sold in North America for November 2025, and that's the lowest since November 1995 (1.4 million units). While total unit sales dropped, the average price paid for a new game console reached a new record high for a November month, rising to $439, up 11% compared to November 2024. The higher average selling price is connected to the price increases that companies like Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, and others have implemented this year due to tariffs and other factors.

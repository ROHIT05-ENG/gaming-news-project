Cambridge Audio Evo One review: 14 speakers makes for an overkill gaming soundbar,"The Cambridge Audio Evo One isn't usually the sort of product I cover, but I felt intrigued when they listed 'gaming' as a potential feature of a dear £999 / $1499 all-in-one music system. This is a product that's more classic hi-fi than gaming soundbar, but with 14 speakers inside and compatibility with the best gaming TVs , it's actually a pretty powerful option that's worth knowing about.

Cracking sci-fi horror Routine escapes a decade of development hell as a great reminder that patronising game design can do one,"There's a bit early on in Routine where your progress is blocked by a blinking computer terminal demanding your personal ID number. I was stumped; maybe because I've been so coddled by modern gaming's frequent insistence on eradicating all but the most minor of friction points that - without a conspicuous Post-it note secreted in the immediate vicinity, a blatant on-screen objective marker to beckon me onward, or (sigh) a chatty companion ready to spit out the answer four seconds in - I wasn't sure how to proceed. And then it hit me. Not 20 minutes earlier, I'd explicitly printed out my own ID card and pinned it to my chest - all the game wanted me to do was look down. Read more"

Star Wars: Galactic Racer Announced The Game Awards,"At The Game Awards , Disney and Lucasfilm announced a new Star Wars game, Star Wars: Galactic Racer. It is one of many upcoming Star Wars games in the works, but this one is all about passing Star Wars environments at several hundred kilometers per hour. Galactic Racer certainly seems to pay homage to Episode 1: Podracer, but the trailer focused more on other types of vehicles like speeders and speederbikes. The brief trailer showed lots of new models of vehicles we haven't seen before, but with a distinct Star Wars style. The Game Awards also debuted another new Star Wars game, an return to The Old Republic era with Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic . For more, see GameSpot's rundown of all the new Star Wars games that are in development. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Warframe Turns To A Very Unexpected Person To Explain Its Lore: Werner Herzog,"Warframe has been hanging around in perpetual beta for well over a decade now. Even the devs themselves joked about it at The Game Awards this year. It may not be finished, but there's a whole world of mythology to dive into. And who better to reintroduce players to Warframe than documentarian and occasional actor, Werner Herzog. Although Herzog didn't appear in person, he left quite an impression in the trailer below.

"New Look At Saros Pushes Back The Darkness, As Well As Its Release Date","A short but sweet new preorder trailer for Housemarque's highly anticipated third-person shooter Saros appeared during The Game Awards on December 11. The trailer didn't tell us much we haven't learned from the previous trailer: there's still an eclipse, actor Rahul Kohli being handsome and angsty, and a whole lot of projectiles and tentacles. What's definitely new, however, is where it ended: on a new release date of April 30, 2026, pushed back from the original date of March 20. At first glance, Saros looks like a pretty straightforward follow-up to Returnal, but it features a number of gameplay differences that pull it further away from roguelite territory. Resources and progression are not lost upon death in Saros, though the world will still be altered, providing a unique experience each run. It stars Kohli, known for Midnight Mass, The Electric State, and more. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
No Law Is a First-Person Adventure Steeped In Vigilante Justice,"Neon Giant’s debut project, The Ascent, dropped players into an isometric action game hosted by a neon world of crime and conspiracy. Today at The Game Awards , the Sweden-based studio announced its next adventure, No Law, a gritty first-person shooter that centers on one man’s quest for vengeance. No Law follows Grey Harker, a retired military veteran living in another neon-soaked metropolis called Port Desire. He leaves active service for a life of peace, but one day he is attacked in his home, and he sets out to learn the truth behind the encounter. Harker’s quest can be approached through a direct approach with guns blazing, or with a careful touch via stealth tactics. In an interview with GameSpot prior to the TGA reveal, Neon Giant co-founders Tor Frick and Arcade Berg spoke at length about how player choices are key to No Law--especially in how Port Desire reacts to those choices.

Ben Starr's Face At The Game Awards Suits 2025 Perfectly,"Sometimes you get caught on camera at something like a baseball game, and your face is forever immortalized with whatever cheese or grimace you made. Ben Starr understood that as, when the camera cut to him during a The Game Awards segment, the prolific voice actor gave a wry smile and two thumbs up. And honestly, it might just be the perfect meme to encapsulate this whole year. Digital Extremes' community director Megan Everett and creative director Rebecca Ford took to the stage to talk about the free-to-play shooter-RPG Warframe . While discussing how they're not there to announce that the game is out of open beta after 12 years of development, Ford shot directly at Starr because the only thing they learned in 12 years is that he'll ""do anything for money."" Cue to Starr, cascaded in a red hue as he gives a slight smile and a double thumbs-up in what could easily be a Call of Duty or Fortnite emote. And he held the pose for a while, too; in fact, he sat there for about four seconds. That doesn't sound that long, but when you've got millions of eyes on you at once, it can feel like an eternity.

Forest 3 Takes Sons Of The Forest To Space,"In a surprise announcement at The Game Awards, indie horror studio Endnight Games has revealed Forest 3, a follow-up to The Forest and Sons of the Forest . In a major departure from the series' usual mutant-infested islands, Forest 3 seems to be taking the protagonist to another planet, with its trailer showing a malfunctioning spaceship crash-landing on an unknown (but still mutant-infested) world. Now for a completely unexpected world premiere. Here’s Forest 3! #TheGameAwards pic.twitter.com/kKiF7b4rAS — The Game Awards (@thegameawards) December 12, 2025 The trailer starts with a cozy spaceship interior, setting a scene you would never guess was related to The Forest or its follow-up, Sons of the Forest. The spaceship soon malfunctions and crashes into a swamp on an unknown planet, slowly building up the horror of its setting as the trailer progresses. While Sons of the Forest hinted at an alien origin to its central mystery, it's still a surprise that the next game in the series will take players to a different planet. There are still very few details about Forest 3 available, including where or even when the game is set. While Sons of the Forest took place a few years after the original game, it's unclear if Forest 3 will also be within a similar timeline, or set in the far future. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"Blizzard Announces Next Diablo 4 Expansion, Two New Classes","The end of Diablo 4's Age of Hatred saga is nigh. Blizzard has officially announced the game's second expansion, Lord of Hatred, is coming April 28, 2026. The expansion marks the end of Diablo 4's ongoing story, culminating in an epic battle against the MMO-ARPG's biggest antagonist: Mephisto. Revealed as part of 2025's The Game Awards , Lord of Hatred sees players team up with an unlikely ally in an attempt to put an end to the Lord of Hatred's uprising. The expansion takes players to the fabled isles of Skovos, a region that was meant to appear in Diablo 3 before ultimately being cut, and serves as the former home of both Lilith and Inarius. In addition to finally taking us to these long-anticipated islands, Lord of Hatred also brings with it two new classes. While Blizzard has yet to reveal what one of these classes might be, the studio confirmed the fan-favorite Paladin is finally making their return. Those who preorder Diablo 4 Lord of Hatred will gain immediate access to the class, just in time for Season 11.

Tomb Raider: Catalyst Revealed Alongside Original Tomb Raider Remake,"The Tomb Raider franchise is one of the most prolific and longest-running in all of gaming, and we got a tease of what's next for protagonist Lara Croft during The Game Awards on December 11.

"First Street Fighter Movie Footage Looks Bright And Colorful, And Then They Beat Up A Car","The very first trailer for the upcoming live-action Street Fighter movie was shown at The Game Awards , which gives us our first proper look at the roster in action. And honestly? It kinda rules. The film, directed by Eric Andre Show and Twisted Metal alum Kitao Sakurai, appears to be far more colorful, stylized, and dialed into the wild side of this series than anyone expected. Suddenly, that wild, eclectic cast, which includes the likes of Cody Rhodes as Guile, Roman Reigns as Akuma, and David Dastmalchian as M. Bison, doesn't seem as out-of-pocket as it sounded on paper. Everyone just looks right, and the colors flying all around the place wouldn't feel out of place as a cutscene in Street Fighter 6. You can check it out yourself below. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Lego Batman: Legacy Of The Dark Knight Releases In May,"The Dark Knight returns next year with a new Lego Batman game, Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight , and at The Game Awards , we got a fresh look at the next Caped Crusader adventure, along with a May 29, 2026 release date. The Nintendo Switch 2 version has been delayed, coming out sometime later in 2026. The new trailer also showcases not only more of the caped crusader in all of his Lego glory, but a glimpse at some of the other heroes lending him their talents, like Catwoman, Robin, Batgirl, and Nightwing. These characters also have special abilities based on their skills, such as Catwoman calling in a cat to take out a goon. There are also plenty of iconic Batmobiles and various other Bat-vehicles shown off, like the Batpod from The Dark Knight. The first solo Lego Batman since 2014's Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, this new adventure plays like a highlight reel of Dark Knight movies with a toyetic spin. The game also borrows from Rocksteady's Arkham series, as Batman utilizes stealth and timing-based combat to keep Gotham safe. While the system is designed to be approachable with expanded windows of opportunity to block attacks, experienced players can dial up the difficulty to experience a challenge worthy of the world's greatest detective.

Next Invincible Vs. Character Is A Brand-New Hero from Invincible's Co-Creators,"In June, Skybound Entertainment and its new development studio Quarter Up announced Invincible Vs., a 3v3 tag-based fighting game starring the cast of the popular superhero series. Today at The Game Awards , the two companies revealed that Invincible Vs. will launch on April 30, 2026, and its roster will include an all-new original superhero--designed by the series's co-creators--named Ella Mental. Ella Mental can control earth, fire, wind, and water, and she uses all four elements in her offense.

Street Fighter Movie Cast Revives Mortal Kombat Rivalry For No Real Reason,"Like any awards show, there's bound to be a moment or two that leaves you perplexed about what's going on. The Game Awards had one such moment just like this, and it came during the reveal trailer for the upcoming Street Fighter film, which was quite chaotic and loud. Moments after Geoff Keighley introduced the Street Fighter trailer, the film's main cast took to the stage. Andrew Koji (Ryu), Andrew Schulz (Dan Hibiki), Callina Liang (Chun-Li), Cody Rhodes (Guile), David Dastmalchian (M. Bison), Jason Momoa (Blanka), Mel Jarnson (Cammy), Noah Centineo (Ken Masters), Olivier Richters (Zangief), Orville Peck (Vega), Rayna Vallandingham (Juli), Roman Reigns (Akuma), and Vidyut Jammwal (Dhalsim) all took the stage to yap about ... nothing much, really. That's not entirely true, sort of. Liang confirmed that the cast wrapped up filming Street Fighter ""a few weeks ago."" Momoa--with a slight sway and a slight slur--cheekily argued with Koji over the pronunciation of ""Ryu."" Koji said the cast was there to present the Best Ongoing Game Award (which Hello Games' No Man's Sky won). Schulz really sought applause by asking the audience to ""make some noise"" if they ever played the game in their life. Schulz, for some reason, then reignited the longstanding rivalry between Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter by inviting ""the whole cast of Mortal Kombat 2"" onto the stage (which didn't happen). Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Gang Of Dragon Is The New, Totally Not Yakuza Game From Ex-Yakuza Devs' New Studio","Gang of Dragon, a new game from former Yakuza/Like A Dragon visionary Toshihiro Nagoshi, made its world premiere at The Game Awards , and it looks extremely similar to the Sega's own gangster franchise. The debut trailer shows a back-alley stabbing, a showdown in a bar, and plenty of action, with what appears to be South Korean actor Ma Dong-seok in the starring role. It all looked very reminiscent of the Yakuza / Like A Dragon franchise (and even has dragon in its own name). Gang of Dragon is said to be ""deep in development,"" but no release date was given. Nagoshi was a 30-year veteran of Sega who became best known for his work on the Yakuza/Like A Dragon franchise. He served as director of Yakuza/Like A Dragon studio Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios for a number of years before departing Sega in 2021. He then formed Nagoshi Studio in 2022, under the umbrella of Chinese publisher NetEase. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Control Resonant Debuts At The Game Awards, And It Stars A New Playable Character","At The Game Awards , Remedy shared more details on its upcoming Control sequel. The game is called Control Resonant, and it's set for release in 2026. In this sequel, both the genre and playable character are different than they were when 2019's Control introduced this branch of the Remedy Connected Universe . As you can see in the reveal trailer, there's an emphasis on melee combat rather than gunplay like many of Remedy's past games. Also, players won't be playing as Jesse Faden again, but instead take control of her brother, Dylan, who was introduced in the previous game and has so far had a... let's call it ""strained"" relationship with his sister. Previously held captive by the Federal Bureau of Control, the bureau has now let Dylan loose as their special weapon in a time of grave danger. Though the game isn't set in a fully open-world environment, Remedy describes the sequel as an action-RPG placed in Manhattan, which acts as an ""expansive, reality-warping playground of choice."" Additionally, Remedy continues to flesh out its connected story universe, but creative director Mikael Kasurinen said that newcomers need not feel left behind, reflecting an approach the team previously took with Alan Wake 2 and FBC: Firebreak. Control Resonant, Kasurinen believes, will be ""easy to pick up and hard to put down."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Next Free Game On Epic Is Out Now, And It's A Big One","Epic Games has announced the next Epic Games Store freebie , and it's none other than Hogwarts Legacy . The 2023 game from Avalanche Software was a huge hit, selling more than 30 million copies and finishing the year as the No. 1 best-selling game in the US , even beating Call of Duty. You still have time to claim this week's free games, which are The Darkside Detective and The Jackbox Party Pack 4 . See all free games at Epic Hogwarts Legacy was a smash hit, but the same could not be said for the following Harry Potter game, Quidditch Champions, which hasn't found much of an audience. A Hogwarts Legacy sequel is now on the way, joining the multiple upcoming Harry Potter projects at Warner Bros., including a new live-action series. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
New Game From Left 4 Dead Designer Gives Off Edge Of Tomorrow Vibes,"Last week's announcement about the collaboration between J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot Games and Left 4 Dead designer Mike Booth was sparse on details. However, the first official look at 4: Loop debuted at The Game Awards . In the trailer below, this co-op game leaves players hopelessly outmatched against alien invaders. The one advantage that the humans have is that they can die over and over again like Tom Cruise in Edge of Tomorrow, and awaken in 3D-printed bodies with the knowledge they need to succeed. The trailer reveals that Earth was conquered in minutes, and most of the human population was frozen in place by some kind of crystalline structure. The scientist narrating the trailer takes the blame for what happened, and also the credit for the potential solution. By using the scientist's 3D-flesh printer, players are effectively immune from permanent death. The game doesn't appear to have an actual time loop when players die, but the knowledge players gain carries over to the next attempt. In an interview with PlayStation Blog , Booth revealed that 4:Loop is a significant step forward from Left 4 Dead. Players can actually pick up their fallen comrades and carry them to safety. And the world itself is more ripe for exploration: Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Leon S. Kennedy Is Back In Resident Evil Requiem, And Now He Has A Chainsaw","A new trailer for Resident Evil Requiem has debuted at The Game Awards , confirming that Leon S. Kennedy will indeed make an appearance in the game. Sony spoiled the surprise earlier this week, as new key art featuring Grace Ashcroft--the daughter of Resident Evil Outbreak's Alyssa Ashcroft--also included longtime Resident Evil star Leon and his classic '90s hairstyle. The new trailer gives off serious Se7en vibes, starting with a wrinkly guy in goggles menacing Grace, before we get our first look at an older, more grizzled badass Leon Kennedy wielding an axe. We find him first checking out crime scenes, before he winds up doing some wetwork against an entire doctor's office with a chainsaw and meeting up with Grace. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
The Game Awards Officially Confirms What Mysterious Monolith Was Teasing,"The mystery of the monolith has been solved, in a reveal at The Game Awards that involved real-life actors and one of the goriest, most graphic trailers of the show. As hinted by a mysterious handful of trademark filings, the statue is promoting a new Divinity game from Larian, which appears to just be titled Divinity. Geoff Keighley also revealed that the statue itself, which made an appearance at the end of the trailer, is called the Hellstone. No doubt it will play a part in the upcoming game, which Keighley said would be Larian's biggest ever. Larian's publishing director, Michael Douse, took to X after the reveal to share some more information on the monolith itself, and why Larian decided to use the physical statue to announce its new game. ""We're all increasingly divorced from physicality, so we wanted to build a monument for not only our international teams to gather around, but for the rest of the gaming community to rally around,"" Douse explained. ""We wanted people to get excited for the next big game on their list, and we wanted to do it in a way that employed skill and craft, by hand, to drive people outside to see it, and to talk about it.""

Exodus Looks To Fill The Space-Opera RPG Void Left By Mass Effect,"After debuting at The Game Awards last year, Exodus--the space-opera RPG developed by Archetype Entertainment and published by Wizards of the Coast--returned to the awards show with a new gameplay trailer. The trailer follows the hero, Jun, from humble beginnings and “salvaging scrap to survive” to becoming the fabled “Child of Orion.” We also see a few glimpses of Exodus’s third-person-shooter gameplay, as well as a few of the hulking brutes Jun will be facing off against throughout the adventure.

And just a few months ago, I lost my dad, who quietly sat in this audience every single year--proud, supportive, always cheering us on.

Debut Title From Last of Us And Uncharted Co-Director Revealed,"One of the big reveals at The Game Awards today was the debut game from Bruce Straley's Wildflower Interactive, called Coven of the Chicken Foot. A single-player adventure about an elderly witch named Gertie and a peculiar creature, the game sees the two build a bond as they learn to work together to fulfill an oath. The big draw is the creature's technology, which will react dynamically to your actions, observing how you play and evolving its abilities to assist you. Set in a stylized fantasy world where all the dungeons have been plundered, monsters have been slain, and heroes have moved on, Coven of the Chicken Foot will see players venture into deadly dungeons and dangerous forests. Gertie doesn't swing a sword to stay out of danger, but the creature can adapt to assist her. Wildflower Interactive says that Coven of the Chicken Foot will be a wordless game, as the story will be pieced together by paying attention to your environment and the small choices you make along the way. Wildflower Interactive was formed in 2021 by Bruce Straley. The veteran game director and artist cut his teeth working on titles like X-Men and Gex: Enter the Gecko in the '90s, and after a stint at Crystal Dynamics, he joined Naughty Dog in 1999. Straley worked on several of the studio's big games during the 2000s, and he served as game director on blockbusters like Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, The Last of Us, and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End.

Next Star Wars RPG Returns To The Old Republic,"Announced via a cinematic trailer during The Game Awards 2025 , Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is an upcoming single-player RPG. We know next to nothing about the game save for the time period it's taking place in--the same as the original Knights of the Old Republic games--but it certainly looks cool. Fate is being developed by Arcanaut Studios with a team being helmed by Casey Hudson (yes, the same guy who was the game director of the first Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and then later, the first three Mass Effect games). The game is being described as a spiritual successor to the original KOTOR games, but it's unclear if that means it will reboot part of the story or simply be the sequel we never got. Only time will tell. ""Working on Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was one of the defining experiences of my career,"" Hudson said in a press release. ""With Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, we're telling a completely new and different story with everything we've learned since--crafting an adventure about choice, destiny, and the timeless struggle between light and dark. It's a dream come true to once again collaborate with Lucasfilm Games."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Mario Has 3D-Platformer Competition In The Form Of A Cute, Confused Badger","During The Game Awards ' Opening Act, the 30-minute pre-show before the show-show begins, developer Day 4 Night unveiled a quirky little trailer for a super-nostalgic 3D platformer with a cute little badger trying to save his home. Move over, Mario and Donkey Kong, because there's a new jumpman in town ... or the woods--wherever badgers live. Bradley the Badger is an upcoming action-adventure platform that, according to its Steam Store page , is a ""love letter to games."" More specifically, the game is this hodgepodge of game-development ideas and faux pas. There are unfinished game worlds you'll have to put back together, ""under review"" cathedrals you'll have to explore, and copious enemies to find as you do it all. As the trailer continues, they are fascinating worlds with funny names: Badgerborne, Cyberbadger, The Last Badger, and the like, all based on tropey game concepts. It's a little reminiscent of Hazelight Studios' Split Fiction . Continue Reading at GameSpot"

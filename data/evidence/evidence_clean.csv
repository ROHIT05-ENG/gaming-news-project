Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's chatty space marine companions aren't so bad - it's Samus who is this game's narrative problem,"As Metroid Prime 4: Beyond hits storefronts, I'm pretty sure you're going to see a whole lot of fevered debate online about the game's curious choice to place Samus, famously quiet Bounty Hunter, as the de facto head of a squad of Galactic Federation soldiers. Does it still feel like Metroid, famed for its sense of creepy, atmospherically rich isolation, if Samus has a buddy in her ear or - worse - alongside her physically? Or does the presence of friendlies ruin that Metroid magic? Read more"
Metroid Prime 4: Beyond review,"Taken as a whole, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond feels like something of a composite. On one hand, it is clearly a follow-up to 2007's Metroid Prime 3: Corruption , drawing close many of that game's greatest triumphs and fumbles with a fascinating reverence. On the other, it is something new for the series, structurally most comparable not to other Metroid games but rather to a different Nintendo adventure franchise (more on that shortly). Then there is how the game is built, feeling almost modular, with different modes and moods of play stitched together with visible seams. With all that said, it certainly - at least broadly - works rather well. Read more"

"Grow A Garden Seeds - How To Get Seed Packs, Limited Time Seeds, And Rarities Explained","There are well over 200 individual Grow A Garden seeds you can plant in your plot of land in the Roblox game . Each one has a different rarity and value, and depending on the type of plant, they can either be harvested once or will keep growing new fruits indefinitely after you sell the ones you pick. However, with such a high turnaround for events and their exclusive seeds, you may wonder if there is another way to get them. Luckily, with recent changes to the game’s structure, there is now a way to get some older plants that were available during the Spring and Summer. Of course, once you get the high-value plants, you’ll want to have them grow, then expose them to as many Grow A Garden weather events as possible to increase their value with multipliers added to them via Grow A Garden mutations . Here are all the ways you can get your hands on Grow A Garden seeds and seed packs, including those you can only find during events. Table of Contents [ hide ] How to get Grow A Garden Seeds The Seed Shop has a wide variety of seeds you can purchase, though its stock is widely variable. How to get Grow A Garden Seeds The first way to get Grow A Garden seeds is to buy them from the Seed Shop. The catch is that there are varying odds on which plants will be available whenever the shop restocks, with the more common seeds restocking more often than those of higher rarity. As such, Transcendent rarity plants, such as Crimson Thorns, will seldom ever see a natural restock. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Grow A Garden Prickly Fruits Explained,"Which Grow A Garden fruits are of the prickly type? Each one of the hundreds of available plants has a type associated with it. Blueberries are, well, berries, while the invaluable early-to–mid game Bamboo plants are classified as woody. One of the more uncommon types is the prickly plants, and that’s an issue if you’re trying to turn in plants for a limited-time reward. Another thing you should be aware of is that fruits can have multiple types at once. For example, though the Rose is classified as a prickly fruit in this Roblox game , it’s also both a flower and a leafy-type plant. Cultivating crops with multiple types can be beneficial in the long run when handling requests during upcoming Grow A Garden updates . So, to know which Grow A Garden seeds you should plant in your plot to get prickly plants, here is a list of all the currently included plants of this elusive type. The in-game guide has all the Prickly plants listed in order of rarity if you type it in the search bar. Grow A Garden Prickly Fruits List There are currently 25 Grow A Garden prickly fruits to find in the game. However, only a handful of them are obtainable right now. This is because many of these were available in exclusive Grow a Garden seed packs during events earlier in the game’s lifespan. Some have made comebacks via the Daily Deals shop, but many others have not at the time of writing. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"An AI VTuber Is Trying To Complete Hardcore Minecraft, And All Hell Is Breaking Loose","The popular AI VTuber Neuro-Sama is attempting to complete Minecraft Hardcore, and her human supervisors appear to be losing all hope following a series of comedic but disappointing failures on her part. Neuro is an AI-powered VTuber created by streamer Vedal987 , and she utilizes a large language model with rapid response times, and the ability to ""see"" screens, read her own Twitch chat, respond to speech in almost real time, and even play games. Now, she's attempting Minecraft's Hardcore mode--the permadeath version of Minecraft that wipes the game world as soon as one player dies. Vedal, along with fellow VTubers Crelly and Filian , has claimed that the Twitch stream will not end until the quartet complete the game. To complete Minecraft, the four need to get to The End to face off against the Ender Dragon --not an easy feat at the best of times, and certainly not when you're relying on a childlike AI to make the right decisions, follow instructions, and cheat death.

Tekken Boss Katsuhiro Harada Is Leaving Bandai Namco After 30 Years Of Iron Fist Tournaments,"Tekken development chief Katsuhiro Harada has announced that he'll be departing from the fighting game series and its publisher Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. Harada--who has worked on every Tekken game since the series first debuted in 1994--said in a social media post that the death of close friends in his life had led to him to consider how much time he had left as a creator, and after consulting PlayStation icon Ken Kutaragi, he decided to leave the publisher after spending 30 years working on the Tekken franchise. ""With the Tekken series reaching its 30th anniversary--an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to--I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close,"" Harada wrote in an online post. ""In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect. Those accumulated events made me reflect on the 'time I have left as a creator.' During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi--whom I respect as though he were another father--and received invaluable encouragement and guidance. His words quietly supported me in making this decision."" I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025.

Netflix Considered Buying EA - Report,"As 2025 winds down, the new biggest potential acquisitions of the year appear to be the $55 billion deal for EA by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and other investors and the more recent proposed $82 billion agreement for Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Studios. Now, a new report suggests that Netflix once considered buying EA and two other movie studios before the Warner Bros. negotiations came together. According to Bloomberg , Netflix executives previously debated whether the streamer should place bids for EA, Fox, and Disney. However, the management team reportedly couldn't agree on a deal and feared that its interest in those companies would hurt its standing with investors. The report doesn't include the details about when Netflix considered these acquisitions, especially since Disney is usually the company that buys other studios including Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. Disney purchased Fox's entertainment assets in 2019 following an extended approval process from government agencies around the world. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Five Nights At Freddy's 2 Defies Poor Reviews With Big Opening Weekend,"Last week, the early word on Five Nights At Freddy's 2 from critics was overwhelmingly negative , with only 12% on Rotten Tomatoes. It didn't matter to moviegoers, however, as audiences showed up to theaters to check out the sequel anyway. According to Deadline , Five Nights At Freddy's 2 had a $63 million opening weekend in the United States and Canada, and $46 million internationally against a reported $36-$51 million budget. That gave the film a $109 million global opening. The first Five Nights At Freddy's had a higher opening in 2023 with $80 million domestically, despite being released in tandem with the film's streaming premiere on Peacock. Regardless, this sequel's opening was big enough to kick Disney's Zootopia 2 out of the No. 1 slot after only a single weekend. It also earned Five Nights At Freddy's 2 a few box office records, including biggest opening for a post-Thanksgiving weekend, biggest December opening for a horror film, and the biggest December opening for Universal Pictures. Additionally, Five Nights At Freddy's 2 now has the third-highest grossing opening weekend for a PG-13 horror movie, behind only the original Five Nights At Freddy's and World War Z, which had $80 million and $66.4 million, respectively.

Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gets $110 Discount At Amazon,"Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gaming Handheld $490 (was $600) Get deal at Amazon See at Walmart See at Best Buy See at Target The Asus ROG Xbox Ally is on sale for its lowest price yet at Amazon . Normally $600, the official Xbox gaming handheld is up for grabs for only $490 for a limited time. It's unclear when this deal ends, but you'll also find the recently released handheld on sale at Walmart ($499) , Best Buy ($500) , and Target ($550) . This isn't the first time the Xbox Ally has received a discount. On November 29, Best Buy and Amazon discounted the device to $500. That deal was only available for three hours as a Black Friday flash deal, so it was easy to miss. If you pick up the Xbox Ally at Amazon, you should also check out some of the third-party accessories available now, including docking stations , screen protectors , travel cases , and microSD UHS-II cards . Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gaming Handheld $490 (was $600) The ROG Xbox Ally is an entry-level Windows gaming handheld with impressive features and performance for the price. The Ryzen Z2 A chip is comparable to Steam Deck's custom AMD APU, and if you increase the TDP--at the expense of battery life--the Xbox Ally can outperform the Steam Deck OLED. For reference, the Steam Deck OLED 512GB model retails for $549. The Xbox Ally has a 1920 x 1080p IPS display with 120Hz refresh rate and support for VRR and AMD FreeSync Premium. If you're comparing to the Steam Deck OLED, Valve's handheld has a 7.4-inch 1280 x 800p OLED display with HDR and 90Hz refresh rate. So the Steam Deck wins in panel type and size, but the Xbox Ally wins in resolution and refresh rate. That said, to get the best performance on Xbox Ally, you will often want to lock the resolution at 720p, so the Xbox Ally doesn't always take full advantage of its advantages. The Xbox Ally is arguably the most comfortable Windows gaming handheld on the market today. Asus opted for the PlayStation Portal approach by essentially splitting the Xbox Wireless Controller in half and connecting it to each side. Along with all of the buttons, triggers, and bumpers found on the Xbox Wireless Controller, the Xbox Ally has two remappable back buttons. It also has motion controls and HD haptics. One of the big selling points of the Xbox Ally is the custom, console-inspired dashboard that is easier to use than the traditional Windows interface. The Xbox Ally has a 512GB SSD, 16GB RAM, a microSD UHS-II card slot to expand storage capacity, two USB-C ports, and a headphone jack. Check out the Xbox Ally's specs and features below.

It's not the only Bethesda adaptation coming to Amazon's streaming service--a Wolfenstein show is coming as well--and some fans are hoping to see The Elder Scrolls game follow. Bethesda's Todd Howard--who has worked as a producer on Fallout and Elder Scrolls titles--won't rule out the possibility that it could happen. But don't expect an Elder Scrolls series anytime soon. While speaking with Eurogamer , Howard said that he ""can't rule in or rule out an Elder Scrolls thing in the future,"" before adding that he thought Fallout was more suitable as an adaptation because it had ""more to say in its genre.""

Fallout's Ella Purnell Shoots Down Potential Romance For Lucy,"Fallout Season 2 is just around the corner, and Amazon Prime Video has largely kept this season's storyline a secret. But there's one thing we can be reasonably certain about: Ella Purnell's Lucy won't be having a romance with Walton Goggins' Ghoul now or ever. During an interview with Geek Culture , Purnell was with Goggins and Aaron Moten when she shot down the very idea of a love affair between Lucy and the Ghoul. ""Here's what I would say: you guys need therapy,"" said Purnell. ""You can't fix him. You can't save him. Let it go. Let it go, hon."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"Path Of Exile 2's Next Update Lets Players Transform Into Wolves, Bears, And Wyverns","Path of Exile 2 players won't have to wait long for the next update. The Last of the Druids is arriving on December 12, and it's putting more than just the magic of the Druids at your command. Players will soon be able to transform their Druids into a wolf, a bear, or even a dragon-like wyvern. The teaser trailer below demonstrates the powers that each new form has to offer. The Druid's ability to transform is tied to one of three different talismans. As a wolf, players can summon a pack to attack enemies or rip adversaries to shreds with their own teeth and claws. Bears are raw power personified, and they can increase their strength through each roar they make. Becoming a wyvern grants the player the power of flight, as well lightning and fire attacks that can bring any adversary to their knees. Even as a human, Druids have formidable abilities to fall back upon. They can command earth and storm elements, which put thunder and volcano attacks at their fingertips. There will be two paths for Druids to ascend to. As a Shaman, Druid magic and spells are amplified to a staggering degree. The Oracle may be the second ascendancy class for the Druids, but it grants players the foresight to predict enemy movements before they happen. Using those visions of the future in battle sounds like it could be very useful. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

This Game Awards Teaser Just Keeps Getting More And More Puzzling,"The Game Awards are coming up soon, and now host and organizer Geoff Keighley is hyping the event with some kind of real-world teaser campaign for something people believe is connected to Diablo. Others do not believe it is connected to Diablo. Some think it's for the next God of War game. Still others think it could be for The Elder Scrolls 6 or Lords of the Fallen 2. All of these suggestions may be wrong, however. On November 28, Keighley posted the tex ""regal.inspiring.thickness"" along with an image of some kind of huge carving featuring humanoid people in the middle of a desert. On November 29, Keighley followed up with a Google Maps image showing the location of the marketing monolith in the California desert. People quickly found the spot and posted images and video, including the ones below. Then on December 5, Keighley posted yet another teaser, this one also very puzzling. Here's the message: ""The █████ are silent. █████ bleeds. New █████ stir."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's Ending Does Samus Dirty (Spoilers),"Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is intended as both a continuation and a new start for the long dormant franchise. Though Nintendo has never quite said it overtly, it has seemed likely that this is meant to launch a new series of Prime games--possibly even a second trilogy, for the sake of dramatic rhyme. And the ending of Prime 4 accents that feeling, leaving the door wide open for more story--but in the process, diminishing the character of protagonist Samus Aran. Spoilers for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond follow. As many eager Metroid fans know from preview coverage and reviews, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond features a wide cast of Federation characters, who have been stranded on Viewros with Samus. As you explore the corners of Sol Valley you eventually meet five in total: engineer Myles MacKenzie, sniper Reger Tokabi, Sergeant Ezra Duke, Private Nora Armstrong, and mech unit VUE-995. Each talks with Samus and relates to her in different ways. Myles is out of his element and needs Samus' rescue. Armstrong is a bona fide Samus superfan. Tokabi opens up to her about his religion and upbringing. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
A $5 Million Gift From Sega Saved Nvidia,"Nvidia today is the world's most valuable company with a market cap of more than $4 trillion, thanks in large part to the AI boom of the past few years. But Nvidia's success was far from guaranteed. CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang recalled recently how a $5 million gift following a failed business deal with Sega gave the company the lifeline it needed at the time, allowing the fledgling company to stay in business and eventually become what it is today. Appearing on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast , Huang talked about how, back in the 1990s, he and his two co-founders were trying to drum up business for their start-up PC company. They traveled to Japan and pitched Sega management on the idea that Nvidia could build the company's Dreamcast console. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Postal: Bullet Paradise Canceled Almost Immediately After Reveal, With AI Allegations To Blame","Earlier this week, Running With Scissors unveiled a new look at Postal: Bullet Paradise , a Postal spin-off developed by Goonswarm Games as a Vampire Survivors-like shooter. However, fan backlash against the alleged AI elements in Bullet Paradise have led Running With Scissors to cancel the game entirely. ""After revealing Postal: Bullet Paradise, a title Running With Scissors was planning on publishing--but not developing--we've been overwhelmed with negative responses from our concerned Postal Community,"" said Running With Scissors founder Vince Desi in a statement. ""The strong feedback from them is that elements of the game are very likely AI-generated and thus has caused extreme damage to our brand and our company reputation."" Desi noted that Running With Scissors has lost trust in Goonswarm Games, which is why the project has now been killed. Subsequently, Goonswarm Games issued a statement to PC GamesN in which the studio denies using AI in either the game or the trailer shown above. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

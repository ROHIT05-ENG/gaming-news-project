Horses review,"One thing that's probably got a bit lost in all the controversy preceding Horses' release is the fact it's surprisingly funny. Its humour is pitch black, yes, and its comedic moments often dance on a knife's edge between laughter and revulsion, but writer and director Andrea Lucco Borlera's first-person narrative horror - his debut game, created in close collaboration with Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione - is a fascinatingly singular vision. It's singular enough, in fact, that it's not an easy thing to effectively describe, but if you can imagine a sort of thematic reinterpretation of Animal Farm by way of Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salo on one side, and a meme-able Garry's Mod video on the other, then Horses gleefully oscillates between them, landing somewhere in the middle.

Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's chatty space marine companions aren't so bad - it's Samus who is this game's narrative problem,"As Metroid Prime 4: Beyond hits storefronts, I'm pretty sure you're going to see a whole lot of fevered debate online about the game's curious choice to place Samus, famously quiet Bounty Hunter, as the de facto head of a squad of Galactic Federation soldiers.

Metroid Prime 4: Beyond review,"Taken as a whole, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond feels like something of a composite. On one hand, it is clearly a follow-up to 2007's Metroid Prime 3: Corruption , drawing close many of that game's greatest triumphs and fumbles with a fascinating reverence. On the other, it is something new for the series, structurally most comparable not to other Metroid games but rather to a different Nintendo adventure franchise (more on that shortly). Then there is how the game is built, feeling almost modular, with different modes and moods of play stitched together with visible seams. With all that said, it certainly - at least broadly - works rather well. Read more"

Medieval Life Sim Adds Free Update That Includes Visible Pregnancy And More,"Since its official launch in 2021, Medieval Dynasty has given players a glimpse of life in the middle ages without any fantasy flourishes. You don't have to worry about dragons, wizards, or orcs killing you in this game, but you still have to survive in some harsh conditions. Now, a free update for Medieval Dynasty is adding some new touches for the game that go beyond mere survival. There were pregnancies and children in this game prior to the Labor of Love update, but there are now more realistic depictions of it including visibly pregnant women, new animations and conversations, as well as a productivity boost for the player during the pregnancy and while the mother takes care of the child. In this game, players go on to play as their children after the death of their characters. Additionally, pregnant women will stop working during their second term. This free update is also accompanied by a paid DLC called The Exquisite Pack. The cosmetic options include two new outfits: a dress and jewelry for a female character and something resembling formal wear for the men. The DLC also gives players an exquisite sword, new hairstyles and mustache designs, as well 13 emblem patterns for players' settlements. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Geoff Keighley's Demonic Game Awards Monolith Has Been Spotted In LA,"As The Game Awards draws closer, everyone's attention right now is on a mysterious demonic monolith that is teasing something . First seen in the Mojave Desert --and described by TGA host Geoff Keighley as being pure ""regal.inspiring.thickness"" as it stood there--the monolith has now been spotted in Los Angeles. It's not clear if this is the same monolith as the one in the desert or a new one, and there's still no clue what this piece of aura-farming architecture is teasing yet. One franchise that it's probably not linked to? Battlefield, as Battlefield Studios senior director of integrated communications Andy McNamara snapped a photo of the monolith and mentioned that it wasn't linked to EA's FPS franchise . The tease from the desert is now in LA? pic.twitter.com/QLihqwQ9rF — Andy McNamara (@TheRealAndyMc) December 9, 2025 Beyond that, there have been plenty more guesses as to what the demonic monolith will reveal. Some people have speculated that it could be teasing the next Diablo 4 expansion or The Elder Scrolls 6--industry reporter Jason Schreier claims it's not related to either IP--and CI Games CEO Marek Tyminski has confirmed that it's not Lords of the Fallen 2 being hinted at. God of War dev Cory Barlog has also downplayed rumors that the next God of War game is what the monolith is alluding to, and the only surefire way to find out what's behind the magic door will be to tune into The Game Awards this week on December 11 at 4:30 PM PT / 7:30 PM ET.

"Lord Of The Rings Lego Sets On Sale For Big Discounts, But Probably Not For Long","The Lord of the Rings: Barad-dur Lego Set (5,471 Pieces) $400 (was $460) Get deal at Woot See at Best Buy See at Amazon See at Walmart The Lord of the Rings: Rivendell Lego Set (6,167 Pieces) $440 (was $500) Get deal at Woot See at Best Buy See at Amazon See at Lego Store The two largest Lord of the Rings Lego sets are on sale at Amazon-owned retailer Woot . From now until December 12, while supplies last, Lord of the Rings fans can save $60 on the 5,471-piece Barad-dur tower and the 6,167-piece Rivendell Lego set . Both sets are part of the Lego Icons line and almost always sell for full price at major retailers. Woot's Lego deals typically sell out fast; in fact, both of these sets sold out in hours when they were featured in Woot's Black Friday sale last month. Take a look at these massive Lego Lord of the Rings models below. We also added a list of more Lego deals at Woot at the bottom of this story, including The Legend of Zelda: The Great Deku Tree , Dungeons & Dragons: Red Dragon's Tale , and several Star Wars UCS models . The Lord of the Rings: Barad-dur Lego Set (5,471 Pieces) $400 (was $460) This $460 Lord of the Rings set includes 5,471 pieces, and the completed build stretches 32.5 inches high (nearly three feet!). It's a massive and intricately designed kit with numerous modular structures. It's capped off with the Eye of Sauron, which illuminates for added authenticity. While J.R.R. Tolkien never specified the number of floors in Barad-dur, the Lego recreation of the dreary and terrifying structure has five levels. On the main floor, you'll create Gollum's hideout, an armory, and a prison for Orcs with a cage that opens and shuts. Level two has a dining hall and kitchen. The middle floor contains Sauron's throne room. The throne itself has a secret passageway to the Palantir chamber--where Sauron does his magic crystal ball activities--which features several cool Easter Eggs, including a map of Middle-earth. Above the throne room is the Mouth of Sauron's study, and the top floor has the library with a movable ladder. Barad-dur is 17.5 inches wide and 12 inches deep, so you'll need ample shelf space and nearly three feet of open space above for the tower spire. The set comes with 10 minifigures: Sauron Mouth of Sauron Gollum Frodo Baggins Samwise Gamgee (Sam) Gothmog 4 unique Orcs It also includes accessories based on the Peter Jackson film trilogy such as the One Ring, Sauron's mace, light of Earendil, helmets for each Sauron figure, various armor and weapons, and more. Get deal at Woot See at Best Buy See at Amazon The Lord of the Rings: Rivendell Lego Set (6,167 Pieces) $440 (was $500) Lego's recreation of Rivendell is actually even bigger than Barad-dur. At 6,167 pieces, Rivendell is one of the 10 largest Lego sets ever made. Unsurprisingly, it takes up a lot of space, too. The completed build is 28.5-inches wide, 19.5 inches deep, and 15 inches tall. Rivendell is home to 15 Lego minifigures, including all of the members of the Fellowship, Bilbo Baggins, and several other characters: Frodo Baggins Samwise Gamgee (Sam) Gandalf the Grey Meriadoc Brandybuck (Merry) Peregrin Took (Pip) Aragorn Legolas Gimli Boromir Bilbo Baggins Elrond Arwen Gloin 2 Elves This highly detailed model features recreations of rooms from the movie, including Frodo's bedroom and Elrond's study. Rivendell is a modular build, which makes it a good one to piece together with a fellow Lord of the Rings fan; this also means you can remove sections from the main building and display them on different shelves, your desk, etc. This includes the section with the table where the pivotal Council of Elrond scene took place in The Fellowship of the Ring. Lego's model of Rivendell features many authentic trappings and decor from the film, including various paintings, ornate castle spires, the white gazebo, statues, archways, flowers and trees, intricate roof tiling, bridges, an elven forge, and the Shards of Narsil. The paintings and statues nod to historical events in Tolkien's Middle-earth writings. Get deal at Woot See at Best Buy See at Amazon Lego Lord of the Rings: Barud-dur Gallery Rivendell joined the Lego Icons lineup in 2023. At the time, it was the only Lord of the Rings Lego set available in stores. Rivendell was joined by Barad-dur the following year. In 2025, Lego released two more Lord of the Rings sets. The 2,017-piece recreation of The Shire released in April for $270. Similar to Barad-dur and Rivendell, The Shire comes with a bunch of minifigures--nine, to be exact. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

The Amazon-owned retailer has the 2,500-piece display model for $265 (was $300). Woot's Lego deals tend to sell out fast, especially on pricey models that almost always sell for full price at major retailers. This is the second time Woot has had a deal on Lego's Great Deku Tree, and the previous deal sold out in hours.

"Pokemon Thieves Make Off With $100,000 In Rare Cards","Pokemon cards are as hot as they've ever been, and unfortunately for a local card shop in California, it means their merchandise was the target of a recent heist. On December 2, thieves targeted LA Sports Cards in Burbank and made off with $100,000 or more in Pokemon cards and other collectibles. The trio of thieves were captured on camera in KTLA 5's video report below. Store owner Kiet Nguyen noted that the thieves seemed to know just where to go to get the most valuable Pokemon cards in the store. ""Liquid assets"" of unopened Pokemon boxes were also taken, and will be easy to sell because of how common they are. Additionally, the thieves stole rare sports cards that featured Mickey Mantle and Ronaldo among others. The thieves were in and out of the store in around three minutes, and the report notes that this trio may have hit other card shops in Southern California. One of the thieves exposed part of his face during an earlier heist, and that could help police eventually track him and his partners down. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

However, per Game File and unlike the KOTOR remake, development on the KOTOR II remake has ceased as recently as March 2025.

""'Juliet' was the codename for a project where we were going to do a full remake of KOTOR II,"" Reilly said. [It would have featured] modern art, modern gameplay, you know, keep the story and the characters and the general--the general content of KOTOR II, but remake it for modern hardware and modern machines with updated graphics and all those kinds of things.

"Future Assassin's Creed Games Could Have Multiple Protagonists, Says AC Shadows Dev","Ubisoft has yet to share its plans for future Assassin's Creed games beyond Assassin's Creed Shadows , but that title's dual-protagonist setup with Yasuke and Naoe may not be the last time players get to have multiple characters to choose from. ""I think the learning for us is that, yes, we could do more dual-protagonist games in the future--if we have a good reason to do it narratively and for the setting,"" said Assassin's Creed Shadows associate director Simon Lemay-Comtois while speaking with GamesRadar . Yasuke and Noae weren't the first dual protagonists in an Assassin's Creed game. Twins Jacob and Evie were featured in Assassin's Creed Syndicate.

"Microsoft Initially Rejected Idea To Bring Flight Simulator To PS5, Dev Says","Microsoft originally rejected a pitch to bring Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 to PlayStation consoles, but the company eventually agreed, and this led to a ""whole avalanche"" of Xbox games on PlayStation. That's according to Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator Jorg Neumann. He told XDA-Developers that it was his own idea to bring Flight Simulator to PlayStation consoles, culminating with the launch of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 today, December 8, on PS4 and PS5. The 2020 Flight Simulator game eventually grew to become 300 GB in size, and there was so much content planned that Neumann said the game could grow to become 1 TB. So instead of doing that, the team made a new game, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and the game now only has 8 GB of space for a requirement, with everything else sent to the cloud. This way of packaging the game allowed the game to come to other platforms, Neumann said. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

That reveal could be soon, as Final Fantasy Remake Trilogy developers Naoki Hamaguchi and Tetsuya Nomura have revealed that the name for the threequel has been narrowed down to two options, with a decision expected by the end of the year. ""Me and Tetsuya Nomura have already narrowed it down to two, within the year we will decide on which one. Within this year, it will be set,"" Hamaguchi said in an interview with Julien Chièze (via a translation by Genki_JPN ). So far, the first two games in the Final Fantasy Remake trilogy have followed a similar naming convention. Remake got the ball rolling with its title, while Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth's title emphasized a new beginning for the franchise. So what could Part 3's name be if it follows this trend?

Shenmue Studio Considering Legal Action Over Fake Shenmue 4 Trailer,"If you saw the Shenmue 4 trailer that went viral recently and were hoping it was leading to an announcement, then you're going to be disappointed. Ys Net, the studio founded by Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki, has issued a statement condemning the trailer as a fake while also hinting that it may take legal action against the trailer's creator. In a post on social media, Ys Net said the fake Shenmue 4 trailer ""uses our company logo without permission, falsely giving the impression that is an official Shenmue 4 related video produced by us."" The statement adds that there have been no official Shenmue 4 materials released, and that the studio is ""currently working with relevant parties and preparing appropriate measures, including potential legal action"" against the creator of the trailer. pic.twitter.com/YqUtrawpiE — YS NET Inc. (@YSNET_Inc) December 8, 2025 The original Shenmue was released in 1999 on Sega Dreamcast, and it cast players as a young man, Ryo Hazuki, as he sought to avenge his father's death. The game had innovative takes on open-world gameplay and quicktime events that proved to be very influential in the video game industry. Shenmue 2 followed in 2001, but the franchise went on hiatus due to low sales. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Don't Expect A New Dead Space Game Anytime Soon,"The Dead Space franchise is reportedly ""on ice"" at EA. And no, we're not referring to the frozen planet of Tau Volantis, the setting for Dead Space 3 . Basically, there are no plans for a new sequel, remake, or even reboot of the survival-horror franchise. Insider Gaming states that EA sources have informed them about the latest Dead Space direction--or lack of direction, in this case. In early 2023, a remake of Dead Space was released, making people speculate about a new sequel or future remakes. But instead, there reportedly won't be any sort of followup anytime soon. GameSpot has reached out to EA for comment. The report adds that the same sources hope the company might sell the Dead Space franchise after EA sold itself for $55 billion to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund , Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and the private equity firm Silver Lake. The deal could lead to $20 billion in debt . As such, there's speculation EA could auction off Dead Space to help pay off that gigantic amount. But that raises questions: What company would want to acquire Dead Space? And would the sum be even a drop in the bucket against $20 billion? Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Where Winds Meet Devs Blown Away By Game's Massive Success,"Where Winds Meet has blown up since its global PC and PlayStation 5 launch on November 14, becoming one of the hottest games on Steam as of late. The open-world Wuxia sim is so hot that the explosive and sustained player count has surprised developer Everstone Studio, who said the numbers exceeded internal expectations. Lead producer Beralt Lyu spoke to FRVR about the game recently reaching nine million players on November 29, just two weeks after its worldwide launch. Lyu explained that while the team always had faith in their Wuxia world, they weren't expecting this much success this quickly. ""We hoped it would find its audience, the players who would love the freedom and mystery we tried to create,"" Lyu said. ""But [nine] million players in two weeks … that number has honestly blown all our internal expectations out of the water. The mood in the studio is hard to put into words. There's definitely pride and excitement--seeing years of hard work resonate with so many people is a feeling like no other. But what really hits us, more than anything, is the sense of responsibility."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Paramount Launches Hostile Bid To Buy Warner Bros., Offering Billions More Than Netflix","The battle for Warner Bros. is not over yet. After Netflix announced on Friday that it would buy the majority of the Warner Bros. entertainment assets, Paramount on Monday announced that it would offer billions more to buy the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery as part of a hostile takeover bid. Specifically, Paramount is offering $30 per share, compared to $27.75 from Netflix. That works out to $18 billion more in cash than Netflix. Additionally, Paramount wants to buy the entirety of WBD, not just the majority of the key entertainment assets that Netflix is proposing to buy. Paramount's $30-per-share offer works out to a total enterprise value of $108.4 billion, which Paramount said is a 139% premium on where the company was trading at in September 2025. The value of Netflix's offer was $82.7 billion. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"GameStop's ""Trade Anything Day"" Included Dead Animals And Can Of Whoop-Ass","GameStop's ""Trade Anything Day"" took place on December 6 and, as expected, people brought in all manner of items to get some cash. GameStop said in a news release that it took in more than 80,000 trades across the US on December 6 alone, and people brought in lots of unexpected and usual items, including a taxidermied bobcat and goose, a speed limit sign, a Wii Netflix disc, a bowling ball, a tiny Jesus, and ""a literal can of whoop-ass."" This was all done as a marketing campaign to raise awareness for GameStop's trade-in program. The retailer also noted that people brought in ""a significant number"" of canned food goods to support food banks and pet shelters. One person attempted to trade in their dog (presumably as a joke, we hope!) but was rejected. Another person tried to trade in their Social Security card but GameStop said no. Someone else brought in a copy of the Declaration of Independence, and GameStop seemingly accepted it. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Fallout Season 3 Plans To Start Shooting In The Summer, Will Release ASAP","The second season of Fallout hasn't premiered quite yet, but that's not stopping the creative team behind the show from planning for Season 3. In fact, they're aiming to start shooting in Summer 2026 and ""get back on the air in a reasonable amount of time,"" according to executive producer Jonathan Nolan.

"Kojima Says His Upcoming Game OD May Not ""Work Out""","Writer-director Hideo Kojima has multiple new games in the works, one of which is the horror title OD . Not much is known about the game, and the recent ""Knock"" trailer raised more questions than it answered. Now, Kojima has further discussed OD, saying it aims to offer something new. Of course, that's what most developers would say. Perhaps more intriguingly, Kojima discussed with ananweb ( translated by Automaton ) how he does not know for sure if his idea for OD will even work. ""I can't say exactly what it is yet, nor do I know if it will work out. We've created stealth games and delivery games which were unlike anything before, but system-wise, they were similar to other games,"" he explained, referencing Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding. ""This time, we're trying to change the service model from the ground up, so it should be quite challenging. We've packed the trailer full of hints, so if you keep thinking about it, you might figure it out."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Grow A Garden Seeds - How To Get Seed Packs, Limited Time Seeds, And Rarities Explained","There are well over 200 individual Grow A Garden seeds you can plant in your plot of land in the Roblox game . Each one has a different rarity and value, and depending on the type of plant, they can either be harvested once or will keep growing new fruits indefinitely after you sell the ones you pick. However, with such a high turnaround for events and their exclusive seeds, you may wonder if there is another way to get them. Luckily, with recent changes to the game’s structure, there is now a way to get some older plants that were available during the Spring and Summer. Of course, once you get the high-value plants, you’ll want to have them grow, then expose them to as many Grow A Garden weather events as possible to increase their value with multipliers added to them via Grow A Garden mutations . Here are all the ways you can get your hands on Grow A Garden seeds and seed packs, including those you can only find during events. Table of Contents [ hide ] How to get Grow A Garden Seeds The Seed Shop has a wide variety of seeds you can purchase, though its stock is widely variable. How to get Grow A Garden Seeds The first way to get Grow A Garden seeds is to buy them from the Seed Shop. The catch is that there are varying odds on which plants will be available whenever the shop restocks, with the more common seeds restocking more often than those of higher rarity. As such, Transcendent rarity plants, such as Crimson Thorns, will seldom ever see a natural restock. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Grow A Garden Prickly Fruits Explained,"Which Grow A Garden fruits are of the prickly type? Each one of the hundreds of available plants has a type associated with it. Blueberries are, well, berries, while the invaluable early-to–mid game Bamboo plants are classified as woody. One of the more uncommon types is the prickly plants, and that’s an issue if you’re trying to turn in plants for a limited-time reward. Another thing you should be aware of is that fruits can have multiple types at once. For example, though the Rose is classified as a prickly fruit in this Roblox game , it’s also both a flower and a leafy-type plant. Cultivating crops with multiple types can be beneficial in the long run when handling requests during upcoming Grow A Garden updates . So, to know which Grow A Garden seeds you should plant in your plot to get prickly plants, here is a list of all the currently included plants of this elusive type. The in-game guide has all the Prickly plants listed in order of rarity if you type it in the search bar. Grow A Garden Prickly Fruits List There are currently 25 Grow A Garden prickly fruits to find in the game. However, only a handful of them are obtainable right now. This is because many of these were available in exclusive Grow a Garden seed packs during events earlier in the game’s lifespan. Some have made comebacks via the Daily Deals shop, but many others have not at the time of writing. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"An AI VTuber Is Trying To Complete Hardcore Minecraft, And All Hell Is Breaking Loose","The popular AI VTuber Neuro-Sama is attempting to complete Minecraft Hardcore, and her human supervisors appear to be losing all hope following a series of comedic but disappointing failures on her part. Neuro is an AI-powered VTuber created by streamer Vedal987 , and she utilizes a large language model with rapid response times, and the ability to ""see"" screens, read her own Twitch chat, respond to speech in almost real time, and even play games. Now, she's attempting Minecraft's Hardcore mode--the permadeath version of Minecraft that wipes the game world as soon as one player dies. Vedal, along with fellow VTubers Crelly and Filian , has claimed that the Twitch stream will not end until the quartet complete the game. To complete Minecraft, the four need to get to The End to face off against the Ender Dragon --not an easy feat at the best of times, and certainly not when you're relying on a childlike AI to make the right decisions, follow instructions, and cheat death.

Tekken Boss Katsuhiro Harada Is Leaving Bandai Namco After 30 Years Of Iron Fist Tournaments,"Tekken development chief Katsuhiro Harada has announced that he'll be departing from the fighting game series and its publisher Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. Harada--who has worked on every Tekken game since the series first debuted in 1994--said in a social media post that the death of close friends in his life had led to him to consider how much time he had left as a creator, and after consulting PlayStation icon Ken Kutaragi, he decided to leave the publisher after spending 30 years working on the Tekken franchise. ""With the Tekken series reaching its 30th anniversary--an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to--I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close,"" Harada wrote in an online post. ""In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect. Those accumulated events made me reflect on the 'time I have left as a creator.' During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi--whom I respect as though he were another father--and received invaluable encouragement and guidance. His words quietly supported me in making this decision."" I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.

While Harada is leaving Bandai Namco, he mentioned he would share his next steps at a later date. In a separate post, Bandai Namco said it remains committed to future development and content for Tekken 8 and expressed gratitude to Harada for his decades of work. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Horses review,"One thing that's probably got a bit lost in all the controversy preceding Horses' release is the fact it's surprisingly funny. Its humour is pitch black, yes, and its comedic moments often dance on a knife's edge between laughter and revulsion, but writer and director Andrea Lucco Borlera's first-person narrative horror - his debut game, created in close collaboration with Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione - is a fascinatingly singular vision. It's singular enough, in fact, that it's not an easy thing to effectively describe, but if you can imagine a sort of thematic reinterpretation of Animal Farm by way of Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salo on one side, and a meme-able Garry's Mod video on the other, then Horses gleefully oscillates between them, landing somewhere in the middle.

Fan-Made Super Monkey Ball Mod Unleashes Chaos In Red Dead Redemption 2,"Rockstar Games' Red Dead Redemption 2 has some moments of levity, but it's not a comedic farce. Or at least it wasn't until a modder found a way to bring the chaotic energy of Super Monkey Ball into game with Arthur as the monkey inside of the ball. YouTube host Blurbs recently fielded requests for Red Dead Redemption 2, including the aforementioned Super Monkey Ball mod. Before it could be finished, Blurbs had to work out how to put Arthur into a ball and and add gyroscopic controls and little bananas for Arthur to collect. But the crowning touch was to let the monkey ball unleash a path of destruction in its wake. I completely recreated Super Monkey Ball inside of RDR2. I asked popular streamers for mod ideas, so blame them. pic.twitter.com/WtltktmxYw — Blurbs (@Blurbstv) December 9, 2025 That was only one of the requests that Blurbs completed for the full video. Some of the others included the creation a gunicorn--a horse with a usable gun attached to their head--as well as a separate gun that can turn NPCs into horses, in addition to birds that target Arthur with their explosive poop. To cap it off, Blurbs activates all of the mods at once, which sends Arthur into Super Monkey Ball mode at very inopportune times. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Team Had ""A Lot Of Arguments"" About The Game's Ending","The Game Awards are just around the corner, and while this time of year is surely exciting for all the nominees --and those of us eager for new game announcements--this year, there is one studio in particular that has more reason than any to celebrate: Sandfall Interactive. Earlier this year, the small-scale studio took the world by storm with its debut title, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 . Despite being Sandfall's first game, the narrative-driven, turn-based RPG quickly entered the pantheon of all-time greatest RPGs, earning nearly universal critical acclaim for its artistry, story, and espousal of mechanics and themes typically associated with Japanese RPGs. Now, Sandfall Interactive stands poised to make The Game Awards history. Last month, the studio broke The Game Awards' record for most award nominations , earning a whopping 13, including Game of the Year. Earlier this year, I spoke with the studio's creative director, Guillaume Broche, who said the team was in ""disbelief"" about how the game has been received; it stands to reason that this sentiment has only grown with the game's tremendous success.

Murray noted that Rockstar initially refused to meet with him unless an NDA was signed, but the company relented following his refusal.

Check Out This Keyboard Dock For Steam Deck And ROG Ally,"DeckTop Standard: $100 | With Splitter: $120 See at Amazon (Standard) See at Amazon (Splitter) Part of what makes the Steam Deck and ROG Ally so appealing is their versatility. Not only are they powerful handheld gaming machines, but they can be docked for use like a more traditional computer or game console. While there are many third-party docking stations compatible with both devices, few are as unique as the DeckTop , which features built-in a keyboard and trackpad. The device even slots onto your Steam Deck or ROG Ally, essentially turning your handheld into a laptop without taking up much space on your desk or in your backpack. If that interests you, you can grab a DeckTop starting at $100 from Amazon. DeckTop Standard: $100 | With Splitter: $120 The DeckTop design is simple. It's a small keyboard with a trackpad at the bottom, paired to an adjustable spring-loaded arm at the top that holds your handheld. It supports Steam Deck, ROG Ally, and the Legion Go. The arm can be tilted up to 180 degrees and swivels 360 degrees, so finding the right viewing angle shouldn't be an issue. The arm also features a cushioned interior, ensuring it won't scuff up your device. You can use the trackpad to simulate left clicks and right clicks, and there's even an option to change the keyboard light brightness and color. If you don't have a USB-C splitter at home, consider picking up the $120 bundle that pairs one with your dock. Using the splitter, you can connect your gaming mouse to the setup, making it a better experience for more traditional PC gaming. When you're not using the splitter, you'll find a nifty leather strap on the side of the keyboard to store it. See at Amazon (Standard) See at Amazon (Splitter) Don't have a handheld to use with the DeckTop? The Asus ROG Xbox Ally is seeing a nice $110 discount right now. Its specs are (for the most part) comparable to the Steam Deck, and if you're a fan of Xbox Game Pass, it's definitely worth a closer look. While the DeckTop is pretty unique, its untraditional format might not be the right fit for everyone. In that case, there are plenty of alternatives on sale at a discount. The JSAUX Docking Station is a perennial favorite, offering a simple docking station with a variety of ports for all your accessories. It's currently $33.24 (was $40) at Amazon--another version is available with a 100W charger that's $50 (was $56). Docking performance is excellent, with support for 4K at 120Hz output. Then there's the UGreen Steam Deck Dock , which also supports 4K at 120Hz and can fold flat for added portability. It's available for $30 (was $46) at Amazon. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
One Of The Best Nintendo 64 Platformers Is Coming To Nintendo Switch Online,"An absolute classic is one of two Nintendo 64 games set to join the Nintendo Classics library this month. Rayman 2: The Great Escape and Tonic Trouble, both from Ubisoft, will be available to play for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers starting December 17. Rayman 2 was originally released in 1999 for Nintendo 64 and PC, with ports on Dreamcast, PlayStation, and other platforms following in subsequent years. It was the first 3D outing for Ubisoft's mascot and received acclaim from critics, rivaling Crash Bandicoot, Banjo-Kazooie, and even Super Mario 64.

Designed by Rayman creator Michel Ancel, the action-adventure game depicts a mutated Earth with a ton of colorful and quirky character designs. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Hell Let Loose: Vietnam Gameplay Trailer Shows Just How Explosive 50v50 Jungle Warfare Can Be,"Developer Expression Games has released the first gameplay trailer for Hell Let Loose: Vietnam , a hardcore 50v50 first-person shooter set during the Vietnam War. A follow-up to 2021's Hell Let Loose--which was inspired by the conflicts of World War 2--players will have to once again rely on tactical teamwork to survive. Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will feature six new maps on launch day, each described by Expression Games as a mix of dense jungle, twisting deltas, and deadly open areas. You won't just be fighting on the ground either, as military helicopters serve multiple roles. From troop deployment to fire support, reconnaissance, and tactical drops, they're an invaluable tool in any match. Players can also engage each other in naval combat, as heavily armed vessels such as the iconic US patrol boat and the PBR will be featured in the game. Maps are also riddled with tunnel networks constructed by the North Vietnamese army, and these offer strategic advantages for surprise attacks and troop movements. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

GameStop's Struggles Continue,"GameStop has released its latest earnings report , shining a light on how the video game retailer is performing in the market--and it was a mixed quarter for the company. Revenue came in at $821 million, compared to $860.3 million during the same period last year, and short of Wall Street projections. Profit, however, soared from $17.4 million last year to $77.1 million for the latest period. GameStop's stock price sank after the earnings report came out, with many saying the revenue miss was to blame for the falling price. Others, however, have said GameStop's strong profit-growth, along with having more than $8.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (up from $4.6 billion last year) is a sign of health. Additionally, GameStop's Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) costs were $221.4 million for the quarter, down from $282 million during the same period last year. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Baldur's Gate 3 Fan Discovers Astarion Has Almost As Much Spoken Dialogue As The Narrator,"Baldur's Gate 3 has been out for over two years now, but fans' enthusiasm for the sprawling RPG remains strong--as is the case with one fan who has spent untold hours documenting and quantifying all the spoken dialogue in the game. Redditor Everwhite-moonlight has taken the time to catalogue the game's extensive spoken dialogue fans, calling the labor-intensive task a celebration of Larian's work. The finished spreadsheet arranges the characters in order from most to least speaking time, which reveals just how much our vampire friend Astarion loves to talk. It's unsurprising that Amelia Tyler's Narrator, whose voice is ever-present through Baldur's Gate 3 as the game's pseudo-DM, has the most lines of dialogue, clocking in at a total of 14 hours and 43 minutes of speaking time. What is surprising is how (relatively) close behind her Astarion sits, with a whopping 13 hours and 6 minutes of dialogue for the Neil Newbon-voiced vampire companion. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

The Mystery Of The Game Awards Monolith Appears To Have Been Spoiled By A Trademark Filing,"It's been a busy week for industry speculation after Geoff Keighley started posting about a mysterious, glowing monolith in the middle of the California desert, which was later moved into Los Angeles . Now, it appears the monolith's mystery might have just been solved through a trademark filing. Rumors that the monolith was erected to tease new Diablo 4 content, Elder Scrolls 6, God of War, or Lords of the Fallen 2 were all shot down by people in the know. While others speculated that it still could be related to The Elder Scrolls Online, or a new FromSoft game, it appears most likely that the statue is promoting a new Divinity title from Larian. A trio of trademark filings were spotted up by MP1st , including a new Divinity logo and a symbol that looks suspiciously like the glowing one on Geoff Keighley's monolith. The familiar-looking trademarks come after Larian's publishing director said there aren't currently any plans for a Divinity: Original Sin 3 , meaning the upcoming title may be a new Divinity game outside of the Original Sin prequel series.

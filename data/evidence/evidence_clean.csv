The Battle Royale Manga Returns With A New Deluxe Edition,"Battle Royale: Deluxe Edition Volume 1 $44 (was $55) | Releases January 27 Preorder at Amazon Battle Royale has been a controversial IP since its first release, starting life as a book and then becoming a cult-classic movie. The franchise's success in print and on the big screen led to an inevitable manga adaptation, which returns later this month in a snazzy Deluxe Edition format. The first volume of the Battle Royale: Deluxe Edition will be available starting January 27, and preorders are available at Amazon--and best of all, it's currently discounted to $44 ahead of launch, saving you 20% off its standard $55 MSRP. Battle Royale: Deluxe Edition Volume 1 $44 (was $55) | Releases January 27 Battle Royale: Deluxe Edition Volume 1 is a 604-page, leather-bound hardcover omnibus featuring the first three volumes of the original manga series that ran from 2000 to 2005. It's unclear if the Deluxe Edition's publisher Yen Press is including a new--hopefully more faithful--translation or the controversial script from the English editions published by TokyoPop. While the Japanese version of the manga closely follows the original novel's plot, the English adaptation--handled by veteran comic book writer Keith Griffen--made substantial changes, resulting in several major plot holes in the later volumes. Either way, considering TokyoPop's releases have been out of print for several years, this new Deluxe Edition will be the easiest way to read the manga adaptation of the wildly popular franchise. Volume 1 launches on January 27, and we expect the next volumes in the series to go up for preorder in the near future. Preorder at Amazon Battle Royale would receive several sequel manga series over the years, but most of these are also hard to find due to their limited print runs. The most recent series in the IP is Battle Royale: Enforcers , which began serialization in 2022. Set decades after the original series, Enforcers takes place in the same universe. After a government artificial intelligence reactivates the infamous Program 68, the unruly kids of Daitoa Academy's Class F find themselves divided into squads, given weapons, and set loose to fight each other to the death. So far, four paperback volumes of the series have been released and translated into English. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

New Vegas Dev Doesn't Agree With Bethesda's Take On Fallout,"So much time has passed between Fallout games that modern players may believe the lighthearted comedic tone of Fallout 4, Fallout '76, and Prime Video's Fallout series were the way the franchise has always been portrayed. But Chris Avellone--one of the designers of Fallout 2 and a writer for Fallout: New Vegas --believes that Bethesda has lost sight of the way that the games were originally intended to be received. When asked on X whether Bethesda hates the franchise, Avellone responded, ""They just don't fully understand its roots and arguably, don't care--they own the franchise, and they just want to do their spin on Fallout and make that the norm. This usually translates into a colorful, shallow theme park (with some interesting DLC exceptions, like Far Harbor, Point Lookout--and I was one of the ones who liked The Pitt)--still, theme parks are fun for some folks, so if people enjoy it, that's fine with me.""

Ghost In The Shell's Deluxe Manga Box Set Launches Next Month,"The Ghost in the Shell Legacy Edition Manga Box Set $119 (was $140) | Releases February 17 Preorder at Amazon Ghost in the Shell is widely considered one of the greatest cyberpunk anime movies of all time, but before its big screen debut, it was a hit manga series. Created by Masamune Shirow, the manga has been around since 1989, and in 2026, the ultimate edition of it will be released. Available to preorder for $112 (was $140) ahead of its release on February 17, The Ghost in the Shell Legacy Edition Box Set brings the original Japanese manga to the West in a high-quality and uncensored package. The Ghost in the Shell Legacy Edition Manga Box Set $119 (was $140) | Releases February 17 The new Legacy Edition is a deluxe hardcover box set of the Ghost in the Shell manga and its sequels, The Ghost in the Shell 1.5: Human Error Processor and The Ghost in the Shell 2.0: Man-Machine Interface. This reprint includes the original Japanese version of the manga, with restored scenes and artwork that Shirow himself edited out of the western release. Each book comes in a premium slipcase featuring brand-new illustrations by Shirow. The box set also includes a collection of multicolored Fuchikoma robot stickers, a double-sided poster with Shirow explaining his artistic process, and 10 posters from the rare, limited-edition 1997 Cyberdelics release. Each poster is 10 inches wide and features etched metallic paper, vinyl stock, and holographic spot gloss. They come rolled and packed inside a protective box. Preorder at Amazon If you don't feel like waiting for this collector's edition, you can pick up the Ghost in the Shell: Fully Compiled hardcover set for $31.71 (was $55). While this is the censored version, it's still a hard-hitting collection of manga with plenty of graphic violence and mature themes at its core. The hardcover is over 800 pages in size, and it includes all the manga series, the ""lost"" stories from Ghost in the Shell 2: Man-Machine Interface, notes on the series, all of the original cover pages, and cover art that Shirow illustrated specially for it. Set in a not-so-distant future, Ghost in the Shell follows the cyborg Major Motoko Kusanagi and other members of the counter-terrorist group Section 9. The cyberpunk manga examines how crime has evolved in this new age of brain jacks, neural chips, military drones, and optical camo. The manga was adapted into a film in 1995, which remains a landmark piece of animation that influenced a generation of anime and Western filmmakers alike, including the Matrix trilogy. If you're interested in checking out the Ghost in the Shell film, it made the leap to 4K a few years ago. This version includes an audio commentary, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and the original theatrical trailer. The film spawned its own unique sequels, spin-offs, and reboots, including Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence and the acclaimed Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex anime series. The series even got a live action adaptation of the original film in 2017 starring Scarlet Johansen. While the film received middling reviews, it at least captured some of the anime and manga's signature visuals. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Forza Horizon 5 Is By Far Xbox's Most Successful Port On PS5 - Report,"In 2025, Microsoft paved the way for the top Xbox franchises to make the leap to Sony's PlayStation 5. Now, a report suggests that there was clear winner among the Xbox ports: Forza Horizon 5 , which hit PS5 four years after its debut.

Marvel Rivals' Deadpool Can Literally Do It All,"Deadpool is coming to Marvel Rivals alongside Season 6 on January 16, and in a first for the hero shooter, he will be able to play any role he chooses--Duelist, Vanguard, or Strategist. As explained by Deadpool himself in the Marvel Rivals Dev Vision video , he's heard the community's ""non-stop complaining online about how the game needs more Vanguards and Strategists,"" so he decided to do the NetEase development team a favor and just be all three roles.

CoD: Black Ops 7 And Warzone Patch Notes Detail Nerfs For OP Guns,"A small update has arrived to Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 and Warzone on January 13, and the patch notes reveal a focus on weapon balancing for Season 1 Reloaded. This includes a nerf for the akimbo variant of the Velox 5.7 pistol in Warzone, and the Maddox RFB assault rifle now has decreased damage ranges in multiplayer and Zombies. For multiplayer and Zombies, the patch notes detail major adjustments for the Maddox RFB assault rifle. This includes a reduction to movement speed, added recoil, and significant decreases to the gun's damage range. The developer says the Maddox RFB has been very strong because of its quick time-to-kill in close quarters, but the controllable recoil let it stretch its effectiveness out to longer ranges than intended. ""We'd like to keep the close-range damage high, as that was core to the weapon's identity in Black Ops 4,"" Treyarch says.

How AGDQ Pulled Off A 70-Person Super Mario 64 Speedrun,"Collaborative challenges aren't a brand-new concept for Games Done Quick--the twice-yearly speedrunning charity event--but KingJO444 took things just a little bit further for Awesome Games Done Quick 2026. On January 10 in Pittsburgh, he gathered a group of 70 players together to attempt an absurdly chaotic challenge: Collect 70 stars in Super Mario 64 with 70 different players. Somehow, he and the community were successful, completing the challenge in under two hours. It wasn't an easy feat to come up with an estimated time for the run, at all, because of the 70 people who participated--each getting exactly one star before passing off the controller--only between 15-20 had any serious experience running the game. Of the remaining players, some had not played Super Mario 64 since childhood, and others had never played the game at all. ""You never know how much someone's going to practice, or what's going to happen on stage,"" KingJ told us in a post-run interview. He set the estimated time to complete the run at an hour and 40 minutes, but this was only slightly longer than the current world record. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

The Razer BlackWidow V4 is another popular device in the esports scene, offering low-latency wireless connectivity, hot-swappable switches, and streamlined control features.

This edition includes all 26 episodes with English audio, the original Japanese audio with subtitles, hours of bonus features, and two films.

Shout Factory has released all of them to date, both as standard and limited-edition Blu-rays. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Split Fiction Director Defends EA, Saying ""Everybody’s Done Something That’s Not Good""","Electronic Arts has never been a particularly popular company in the eyes of consumers, but Hazelight Studios founder Josef Fares, who collaborated on three titles with the publisher, was willing to go up to bat for it during a recent interview. Speaking to The Game Business , the Split Fiction director said that there are ""a lot of great people at EA"" who ""respect"" Hazelight's work and ""leave [them] be."" Then, in classic Josef Fares fashion, he argued that ""there’s not a publisher in the world that hasn’t f****d up now and then."" While EA has an infamous reputation, ""earning"" the title of ""Worst Company in America"" from the website Consumerist in 2012 and 2013, Fares still believed that ""EA is getting more sh*t than they deserve.""

The Division 2 Is Getting A Game-Changing New Mode,"Tom Clancy's The Division is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, but The Division 2 players are the ones who are getting a gift. An update coming this March will add a Realism Mode to The Division 2, giving fans a new way to experience the game. Realism Mode is only available for players who purchased the Warlords of New York expansion. The mode itself is a stripped down version of the game that drops or modifies some of the series' traditional elements, like the HUD, the map, and hitmarkers, as well as XP and leveling progression. Instead, players will have to adjust to a completely rebalanced arsenal and a reality where shooting a foe in an arm or a leg isn't very effective anymore. But headshots still work, which is good news considering that ammo will be much harder to find in this mode. The Division 2 Realism Mode announced for March 2026 for their 10 anniversary celebration Also Year 8 pic.twitter.com/INO8Q0BrF9 — Chito (@ChitoGamingLive) January 12, 2026 In the announcement video above, the Ubisoft team revealed that the upcoming anniversary season will feature a collaboration with another Tom Clancy creation, but further details about that particular collaboration weren't shared.

WoW Players Might Be Able To Charter Their Own Neighborhoods Soon,"Those discontent with their current World of Warcraft housing neighborhood may soon have another option at their disposal. Currently, those participating in WoW's recently added player housing feature have two options when it comes to joining a neighborhood. The first is to join a public neighborhood that is open to anyone, while the second is to be a member of a guild and join a neighborhood that only fellow guild members can live in. Soon, however, it looks like there will be a third option to choose from. The ability to create invite-only charter neighborhoods recently appeared for testing on the beta for WoW's upcoming Midnight expansion. The feature doesn't appear to be fully functioning just yet, but there is an option for naming and purchasing a charter neighborhood, implying that the feature is indeed on the way.

Split Fiction Boss Hopes AA Games Don't Take Over The Industry Completely,"Developer Sandfall's RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was one of 2025's breakout hits, and with a budget of reportedly less than $10 million , a relatively small development staff, and a price point below $70, some have said the game could be representative of a ""AA""-style project that can break through. It may have worked for Expedition 33, and it could work for other titles, but Hazelight boss Josef Fares wants to see the AAA space continue and hopes that decision-makers in gaming don't go all-in on smaller-scale games with lower budgets. ""You do hear, after the success of things like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, that the AA games are taking over. But I would not be able to live without a AAA title,"" he told The Game Business . ""I really want to play the blockbuster games. You can't do GTA for $10 million. We need both."" Fares went on to say that ""it's important not to get stuck in ideas."" People should not allow themselves to be convinced that ""AA is a new thing"" or ""indie is a new thing,"" he said. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Diablo 4's Leaderboards, And An Annoying Affix, Are Currently Broken","Diablo 4's latest patch brought the return of leaderboards to Blizzard's ARPG in the form of The Tower dungeon, but the new update isn't without issues. Both leaderboards and an enemy affix are currently bugged. In a post on the Diablo 4 forums , community manager Marcoose let players know that while The Tower is still accessible, leaderboard results aren't currently populating correctly for all classes. Blizzard is investigating the issue but, as of writing, does not have any updates on the problem.

The bright side is Blizzard is taking the opportunity to rework the affix to make it less punishing, with the new and improved version of the affix set to return in a later update.

Warhammer Maker Doesn’t Want AI Anywhere Near Its Creative Work For Now,"While the hype around AI continues to grow, Warhammer's parent company, Games Workshop, is adopting a more skeptical approach to the technology for now. Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree spoke about AI, confirming that the company has banned its use in its content production and design processes, although a ""few"" senior managers have begun experimenting with it. ""We do have a few senior managers that are [experts on AI]: none are that excited about it yet. We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious, e.g., we do not allow AI-generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorized use outside of GW, including in any of our competitions,"" Rountree said during the company's financial results meeting (via IGN ). ""We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security, and governance perspective; the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops, whether we like it or not."" Rountree explained that Games Workshop will instead invest in hiring more creative professionals across various departments to help craft new content for its IP, including Warhammer 40,000 and Age of Sigmar. The company is known for selling Warhammer 40K Codex books featuring a rich selection of illustrations with a distinctive grimdark aesthetic, and any hint of generative AI usually draws backlash from fans. For example, Displate had to issue a statement last year denying that several of its officially licensed Warhammer 40K products were created with generative AI, following fan accusations .

New Fable Could Come To PS5 On Day One,"Playground Games is working on two new games, including Forza Horizon 6 and a new Fable title , and both are expected to release on PS5--but only one may come to Sony's console day and date with the Xbox and PC versions. VGC's Andy Robinson said he expects Playground's new Fable game to be released day-and-date on PS5 because the team has been ""targeting PS5 for a while."" Forza Horizon 6 is confirmed for release on PS5, but not until after the Xbox and PC versions arrive. According to VideoGamer , Robinson said he was informed that the game ""wasn't ready"" for a day-and-date PS5 release. However, he acknowledged that he does not ""know how true that is."" When Forza Horizon 6 was announced in 2025, Microsoft said it would come to PS5 after the Xbox and PC releases, but the company did not say what the exact gap would be. As for Fable, there is no word yet at all about a PS5 release, but it would be little surprise, given the belief that Microsoft will release all of its big games on PS5.

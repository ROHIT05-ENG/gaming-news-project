Horses review,"One thing that's probably got a bit lost in all the controversy preceding Horses' release is the fact it's surprisingly funny. Its humour is pitch black, yes, and its comedic moments often dance on a knife's edge between laughter and revulsion, but writer and director Andrea Lucco Borlera's first-person narrative horror - his debut game, created in close collaboration with Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione - is a fascinatingly singular vision. It's singular enough, in fact, that it's not an easy thing to effectively describe, but if you can imagine a sort of thematic reinterpretation of Animal Farm by way of Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salo on one side, and a meme-able Garry's Mod video on the other, then Horses gleefully oscillates between them, landing somewhere in the middle.

Baldur's Gate 3 Fan Discovers Astarion Has Almost As Much Spoken Dialogue As The Narrator,"Baldur's Gate 3 has been out for over two years now, but fans' enthusiasm for the sprawling RPG remains strong--as is the case with one fan who has spent untold hours documenting and quantifying all the spoken dialogue in the game. Redditor Everwhite-moonlight has taken the time to catalogue the game's extensive spoken dialogue fans, calling the labor-intensive task a celebration of Larian's work. The finished spreadsheet arranges the characters in order from most to least speaking time, which reveals just how much our vampire friend Astarion loves to talk. It's unsurprising that Amelia Tyler's Narrator, whose voice is ever-present through Baldur's Gate 3 as the game's pseudo-DM, has the most lines of dialogue, clocking in at a total of 14 hours and 43 minutes of speaking time. What is surprising is how (relatively) close behind her Astarion sits, with a whopping 13 hours and 6 minutes of dialogue for the Neil Newbon-voiced vampire companion. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

The Mystery Of The Game Awards Monolith Appears To Have Been Spoiled By A Trademark Filing,"It's been a busy week for industry speculation after Geoff Keighley started posting about a mysterious, glowing monolith in the middle of the California desert, which was later moved into Los Angeles . Now, it appears the monolith's mystery might have just been solved through a trademark filing. Rumors that the monolith was erected to tease new Diablo 4 content, Elder Scrolls 6, God of War, or Lords of the Fallen 2 were all shot down by people in the know. While others speculated that it still could be related to The Elder Scrolls Online, or a new FromSoft game, it appears most likely that the statue is promoting a new Divinity title from Larian. A trio of trademark filings were spotted up by MP1st , including a new Divinity logo and a symbol that looks suspiciously like the glowing one on Geoff Keighley's monolith. The familiar-looking trademarks come after Larian's publishing director said there aren't currently any plans for a Divinity: Original Sin 3 , meaning the upcoming title may be a new Divinity game outside of the Original Sin prequel series.

Minecraft's Mounts of Mayhem Update Lets Players Ride Into Combat,"The fourth and final Minecraft update of 2025 has arrived. Mounts of Mayhem is out now for owners of Minecraft Java and Bedrock Edition. The new Minecraft update allows players to ride into battle on top of their favorite mounts while adding a few new options as well. But as seen in the launch trailer below, the new mounts come with new enemies, and players will have to dispatch those rivals before they can claim ride of their own. Camel husks spawn in deserts and come with two mob riders known as the Parched, both of whom are immune to sunlight. Both riders will have to be defeated before players can claim the camel husks as their own. At night, players may encounter zombie horses, which come with zombie riders. These horses may be undead, but they can still be yours if you defeat their riders. When players go underwater, there are two options: The nautilus and the zombie nautilus. A regular nautilus won't have a rider, and players can win its heart with a pufferfish as a treat. Zombie nautilus, however, are a bit harder to tame because their zombie riders will have to be beaten first. But like their living counterparts, the zombie nautilus love pufferfish.

Audience reviews have been kinder, and while the film may not have reached the same heights as the original Tron or 2010's Tron: Legacy, there is still appreciation for how it pushes the franchise's concepts further and for its hard-hitting Nine Inch Nails soundtrack.

""We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games,"" Activision said in the official announcement . ""The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year."" Alongside this announcement, Activision promised ""meaningful, not incremental"" innovation for the series' future. It didn't specify exactly what this would mean, instead stressing it would share more ""when the time is right."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Games Weren't A Big Part Of Netflix's Attempted WB Takeover,"Last week, Netflix put forth an $82 million deal to purchase Warner Bros. Studios , one of the biggest movie and TV studios in the world. Warner Bros. also has a considerable place in the video game industry with franchises like Batman, Harry Potter, and Mortal Kombat under its domain. However, one Netflix executive has now acknowledged that Warner Bros.' gaming division wasn't a significant factor in considering its bid. During a Netflix conference call about the potential WB sale, co-CEO Gregory K. Peters expressed some eagerness to exploit the video game franchises under Warner Bros. in the future. But he added that the games were ""relatively minor"" in the company's initial plans and that it may be ""worth going back again to sort of how we thought about the deal and building our valuation model."" ""While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn’t attribute any value to that from the get-go because they're relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things,"" continued Peters. ""Now we are super excited because some of those properties that they've built--[Hogwarts Legacy] is a great example of that--have been done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we're offering. They've got great studios and great folks working there. So we think that there's definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven't built that into our deal model.""

"The Game Awards Creator Hears Your Feedback --""Do We Always Get It Right? No""","The Game Awards host and organizer Geoff Keighley has opened up on the challenges of running a show that aims to celebrate games and the people who make them while also acknowledging the challenging times people in the industry today are facing. So far in 2025, numerous developers lost their jobs , Microsoft canceled games , and the industry further consolidated with EA announcing plans to sell itself to Saudi Arabia. Speaking to The Game Business , Keighley said the introduction of the Game Changer award in 2024 was an initial attempt to address this. Amir Satvat was given the prize for his work to support people who were laid off in the gaming industry. Keighley hasn't said if this award is coming back in 2025, but it would be a glaring omission if it did not. In any event, Keighley said walking the line between celebrating games and acknowledging current circumstances is no easy task. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Sony's PS5 ""Must-Play"" Games Of 2026 Video Includes Halo But Not GTA 6","After 25 years of being exclusive on console to Xbox, Microsoft's Halo series is headed to PlayStation in 2026 with Halo: Campaign Evolved . With the year coming to a close, Sony has published a video highlighting some of the ""must-play"" titles coming to PS5 in 2026, and Halo got a special shoutout in the video, while GTA 6 was not mentioned. Seeing Halo promoted so heavily by Sony would have been unthinkable not long ago, and the comments on the video reflect this. The top comment on the video states, ""Seeing Halo here is still surreal."" Someone else said, ""It feels so weird seeing Halo being advertised by PlayStation."" Others have pointed out that Rockstar's GTA 6 is not mentioned in the video, with people taking this to mean, or suggest, that Sony is concerned that Rockstar could push the game to 2027. But there could be any number of reasons why GTA 6 was left out. Rockstar, after all, is highly protective of its own game assets. To be sure, it is a giant leap to say that GTA 6 not being featured in video means the game won't make it out on time in 2026. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Fallout's Ella Purnell Still Has Her Poop Finger In Season 2,"In the first season of Prime Video's Fallout, Ella Purnell's Lucy lost one of her fingers to The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) and eventually replaced it with another ghoul's finger.

""It's the thing that is the Wasteland that Lucy carries with her. It's quite literally a piece of the Wasteland. Some random ghoul's finger that she's now got stuck.

"Arc Raiders Cold Snap Update: Start Date, New Map Condition, And Everything We Know So Far","Arc Raiders has been the talk of the town in the multiplayer arena over the past two months, landing a nomination for Best Multiplayer Game at The Game Awards and becoming one of the most played games in recent weeks . As players prep for this month's upcoming Expedition--an optional wipe that resets much of their progress in exchange for in-game rewards--they'll also be treated to the fresh Cold Snap update.

Table of Contents [ hide ] Cold Snap release date Cold Snap release date Arc Raiders' Cold Snap update will release on December 16, 2025 .

WoW Player Houses Are Now Officially Allowed To Fly,"World of Warcraft players are pushing the game's new player-housing system to its limit, including defying the laws of gravity in a way Blizzard never intended. But rather than fix the ability to send houses skyward, Blizzard is instead embracing it. When housing first arrived on December 2 as part of patch 11.2.7, it didn't take long for players to discover that, while the UI didn't show it, houses could actually be lifted off the ground using keybinds. The result was players making all kinds of airborne housing creations, including elaborate treehouses, airships, mechs, homes held up by kites, and everything in between. In a forum post , WoW community manager Randy Jordan (aka Kaivax) stated that instead of fixing the ability to elevate houses, Blizzard has with this week's scheduled maintenance actually made it easier by enabling proper controls to move houses upward.

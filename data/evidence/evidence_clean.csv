Now, Bethesda's Todd Howard has indicated that most of the Bethesda team is working on The Elder Scrolls 6. ""It's progressing really well,"" Howard told Game Informer . ""The majority of the studio's on [Elder Scrolls 6]. but I'll say this: We always overlap. So, we're very used to overlapping development.

"How Total War: Warhammer 40K's Factions Will Be ""Totally Different"" From Past Games","Total War: Warhammer 40,000's four asymmetrical factions will vary wildly from one another, as developer Creative Assembly has now outlined how some of the game's factions will play and be ""totally different"" from factions seen before in the Total War franchise. After being announced during The Game Awards , more details about developer Creative Assembly's next game have been revealed via a new developer roundtable. The four factions players will have to choose from include Space Marines, Astra Militarum, Orks, and Aeldari. Mann said the universe has a lot of opportunities for asymmetry between the factions, and Creative Assembly knew that it could only pick a limited number of playable factions in order to give each one the amount of effort to make them feel special. In terms of how they play, each faction will field troops, gather resources, and engage in battle in different ways. Of the four factions, Astra Milatrum is said to be the most ""traditional"" Total War faction, with mass ranks of infantry and support from artillery and vehicles. Like in other Total War games, Astra Militarum players will need to gather resources, build infrastructure, and recruit more troops in order to succeed. In true Astra Militarum fashion, solving problems will often mean throwing more masses of bodies at it. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Check Out These New Mini Sonic & Pac-Man Arcade Cabinets,"My Arcade Sonic the Hedgehog Mighty Player $120 See at Amazon My Arcade Pac-Man 45th Anniversary Mighty Player $120 See at Amazon Retro gaming manufacturer My Arcade launched its Sonic the Hedgehog Joystick Player last month, and now it's joined by two more diminutive arcade cabinets--the Sonic and Pac-Man Mighty Players . These are much larger than the existing Sonic Joystick Player, clocking in at around a foot tall and 7 inches wide, making them tiny enough for a countertop but big enough to be comfortable during extended play sessions. They also feature 3.5-inch screens and come with four pre-installed games. If you're interested in adding them to your game room, they're available now at Amazon for $120 each. My Arcade Sonic the Hedgehog Mighty Player $120 This officially licensed Sega product features a 3.5-inch color display, wood construction with an illuminated marquee, a rechargeable battery offering five hours of playtime, and a tiny control panel with various buttons and a joystick. The cabinet clocks in at 12 inches tall, 7.4 inches wide, and 5.9 inches deep, making it larger than most other products in the My Arcade lineup. The cabinet is finished with a retro Sonic design, along with a bold blue color scheme throughout the entire unit. As for the games packed inside? Here's what you'll get: Sonic the Hedgehog Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Sonic Spinball Sonic 3D Blast See at Amazon My Arcade Pac-Man 45th Anniversary Mighty Player $120 This one gets you all of the same features as the Sonic Mighty Player (wood construction, illuminated marquee, 3.5-inch display), but this time it's all about Pac-Man.

Here's a look at its game list: Pac-Man (Classic and Speed-Up) Pac-Man Plus Super Pac-Man Pac & Pal See at Amazon These Mighty Players are a bit smaller than Arcade1Up Countercades, which typically stand over 12 inches tall, around 9 inches long, and 9 inches wide. These My Arcade Mighty Players are a bit cheaper than the Arcade1Up Countercades and their $150 price tag--however, a few Countercades are currently on sale for $130, making them worth a closer look ahead of the holidays. This includes the Class of '81 Ms. Pac-Man/Galaga Countercade and Pac-Man Countercade . The former includes Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, and DigDug, while the latter offers Pac-Man, Super Pac-Man, and Pac-Mania. Both include a 7-inch LCD display (which is quite a bit larger than the 3.5-inch display of My Arcade), so be sure to give them a look while they're on sale. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
How Horses' Ban Reflects The Gaming Industry's Double Standards And Emotional Immaturity,"A tectonic shift in the political climate has given rise to a sharp increase in authoritarian practices and policies and made 2025 an unprecedented and disconcerting year for censorship, including for the video game industry. In the face of outstanding pressure on the payment processors powering storefronts like Steam and Itch , thousands of games--largely pertaining to adult subject matter that was sexual in nature and labeled NSFW--were either removed or deindexed from those respective stores. Though the uproar around these removals died down with time--partly due to loss of momentum pressuring these stores to rescind the bans, partly because certain free games were eventually reindexed on Itch--the recent release of Santa Ragione's Horses has brought the conversation back for another round before year's end. That's because, once again, a title with a significant amount of adult content (seriously, Horses fits a lot of taboo material into a fairly brief runtime) has found itself in the crosshairs of the ongoing puritanical culture war that's raging throughout the country, as well as in the world of video games. And as it continues, the controversy around certain games and their subject matter begins to raise questions about artistic expression, who in this medium is allowed to discuss and prominently feature adult-oriented content, and what kind of conversations and explorations of these subjects will the corporate powers in control of the industry permit. Horses is a notable development in this ongoing controversy for several reasons, not the least of which is the preventative measures taken against it. Whereas the bulk of the censorship mentioned here came well after games were released and available to play, affecting many games that had already been listed on these stores for some time, Horses has been facing an uphill battle leading to its release on December 2.

Arc Raiders The Clean Dream Quest Guide,"There are a lot of quests to complete in Arc Raiders , but only a few send you beneath Spaceport's Launch Tower to navigate its dark and dreary tunnels. One of these quests, The Clean Dream, asks you to begin by searching containers and monitoring a filtration system before sending you off to a whole new map. If you're looking to tackle this quest, we've got everything you need to know below. Table of Contents [ hide ] Search 4 containers in the underground tunnels Search 4 containers in the underground tunnels First, you're headed to Spaceport to search four containers in the underground tunnels. These tunnels run all along the center of the map, and there are a variety of ways to get down there and navigate them. However, the most common and easily-accessible entrance will be the same spot you visited during the Switching the Supply quest, which is a collapsed section a bit southwest of the Launch Tower. This is the best entrance to the tunnels for most players. While you're down here, you can search any lootable container--including ""breach & search"" boxes--to complete this part of the quest. Even if something has been opened and searched by another raider, you'll get credit for searching it yourself. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
It's Almost Annoying How Fun Splitgate 2 Was,"Shooters are having a moment in 2025, with Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders topping the charts and attracting large player counts as the year comes to an end. The former title is a return to form for a legacy franchise, while the latter leads the charge for the fledgling extraction-shooter genre. Left in the dust in the shooter space, however, is Splitgate 2, a game that its makers thought would revitalize a genre they saw as growing stale. Developer 1047 Games released the first-person shooter in May, exuding extreme confidence in its product. Splitgate 2 tried to bank on nostalgia for old-school arena shooters, directly invoking Halo and even Titanfall. Yet, the game was also marred by contradictory decisions, adapting present-day monetization models and industry-wide fads like battle royale modes. Splitgate 2 is a blip in the big picture of 2025, but the issues and drama surrounding the title and its release were so prolific that the game is certain to be the subject of YouTube essays and analysis for years to come. From microtransaction controversies to studio CEO Ian Proulx donning the most egregious headwear possible in a livestreamed industry event, along with developer layoffs and an extremely unusual ""unlaunching"" of the game , 2025 was nothing but tumultuous for the Splitgate team.

"Divinity Will Likely Be An Early Access Game, Just Like Baldur's Gate 3","Larian's Baldur's Gate 3 launched first into early access on Steam, and now the studio has teased that its next game, Divinity, could follow a similar playbook. Larian boss Swen Vincke told GamesRadar , ""We still want to do early access."" He isn't 100% committing to it as of yet, but said this approach worked for its past games. ""It's been the blueprint, especially the community participation with early access, which is what interests us. It was [with] Divinity: Original Sin 1, Divinity: Original Sin 2, Baldur's Gate 3--they [the community members] were a large part of how we developed the games,"" he said.

Cut to the interior of a police car; a zombie attack; our hero's gruesome death; a portal opening onto the space-time continuum and a granddad on a motorbike. Romeo Stargazer's resuscitation via the medium of eyeball syringe and big spacehat. More zombies! A love story told in flashback, relayed by an energetic camera gliding across a beautifully illustrated comic book. Romeo's dimension-hopping evil girlfriend Juliet, and his Doc Brown-like granddad inexplicably reborn as a sentient jacket patch. Honestly, if I hadn't just spent the last six hours playing it, I'd call Romeo is a Dead Man exactly the kind of game they don't make anymore. Read more"

Developer Larian's fantasy RPG is, of course, a hugely beloved game, and responses to the news have been swift, strong, and not entirely positive. Feelings have also been floating around the Eurogamer office (well, it's more of a chat room, but you get the point), and, thus, the embers of this week's The Big Question were inflamed.

"Markiplier's Iron Lung movie might be getting all the attention, but the horror game it's based on is a masterclass in the power of suggestion","Perhaps you recently glanced at the internet and saw the fuss about Iron Lung. The indie horror movie got off to a rip-roaring start last week , elbowing Melania aside to take the number two spot in the US box office charts, thwarted only by Send Help, the latest from horror movie king Sam Raimi. Iron Lung's success can almost certainly be attributed to its links with mega-popular YouTuber Mark Edward Fischbach - better known as Markiplier - for whom the project's clearly been a labour of love, given he not only self-funded it, but wrote it, directed it, and starred in it too. But whatever there is to be said about the movie (critical opinion is mixed ), its headline-making turn has finally given me the nudge to check out the game it's based on, having languished on my Steam wishlist for so long. And, yup, it's a good 'un. Read more"

"Difficulty done differently: Cairn and Baby Steps deliver kinder, more generous masocore","For the past week, instead of actually relaxing in the evenings, I have been ascending the gnarled brute of a mountain in Cairn . The onerous journey has left the toes of its alpinist star Aava bloodied; I've pushed the tendons of her rangy fingers to snapping point. With more frequency than I care to admit, I've caused this hell-bent climber to tumble down the same part of rock face over and over again, saved only by a piton. At other times, lacking such safety measures, she has bounced all the way down to Kami's base off jagged, life-ending shards of rock. I curse the game, mountain, and myself with each major and minor tumble, every lost metre and handful of minutes. Read more"

"Don't sleep on Nioh 3's wonderful asynchronous multiplayer, a life-saver and unexpected death bringer in equal measure","Nioh's weird multiplayer has always been one of the most unique quirks of the Soulslike-cum-masocore series. I'm not talking about the needlessly complicated suite of co-op options that pals can use to run through the game together, I'm talking more about the asynchronous multiplayer that's woven into the DNA of the series itself. If you wander out into the 'open field' of Nioh 3 , for example, you will find red graves littered around the area. Each of these marks a place where a fellow player has died - and inspecting it will tell you the bloody fate they suffered. Read more"

"Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined sands down every sharp edge of a prickly classic - making it delightfully approachable, but not without cost","To remake anything beloved is to walk a tightrope. There is always a delicate balance to be struck between keeping what made the original great intact and delivering on the remake's promise to modernise, improve and strengthen. It's such a hard task that one can be forgiven for being reluctant to undertake it even once, but in the case of Dragon Quest 7 Square Enix now faces down this conundrum a second time. Are they gluttons for punishment? Read more"
Mewgenics is an infernal machine that runs on cats,"One of the greatest things on earth is when you're talking to someone you sort of know and they quietly switch from talking about human friends or family members to talking about their cats. It's great because there's often no meaningful alteration in tone to tell you something has changed. Cats are frequently introduced into conversation the same way a person might start talking about an intermittently beloved uncle who's just out of prison. Cats are often delightful reprobates and oddballs. They're needlessly, inventively cruel, or inhumanly calm and forbearing, or they're ostentatiously silly. One will sit on the landing and swipe at everyone. Another will hide under a bath mat, certain that they have attained complete invisibility. They are known by their names but also by their behaviours. Read more"

"""What would I change if we could go back?"" Inside Blizzard's big plan to put Overwatch back on top","Overwatch 2 had a problem. It's a problem a lot of live service games have, to be fair. It wasn't particularly exciting any more. It had a chance at launch a few years ago to excite people, to create a wave of momentum to surf thereafter, but it floundered, beset as it was with identity problems and a misguided obsession with PvE, which sounded lovely on paper but never really worked in practice. Plenty of good work was done since on the game but most people outside of Overwatch 2 don't care - or don't know, because they're not looking anymore. They've moved on, they're playing other things. Incremental updates weren't enough to turn their heads. As far as many people were concerned, Overwatch 2 was yesterday's news, been and gone. How, then, does Blizzard make people care again?

Nioh 3 review,"The Nioh series isn't exactly known for its nuance: there is good and evil, strong and weak, and little in-between. From feuding clans to the machinations of political elites, this binary is at the heart of everything in Team Ninja's pseudo-historical canon. Nioh 3 takes this black-and-white worldview and applies it to the feuding Tokugawa brothers at the start of the Seventeenth Century. Your character, Takechiyo, is good: noble, just, proper . Your brother, a bitter little rat tempted by ancient powers beyond his understanding (of course), is evil. His desire for power and notoriety is so distinct, in fact, that it has somehow summoned a supernatural 'crucible' from the darkest reaches of space-time, and this consuming chaos is so profound, it has managed to seep into four major eras of Japanese history. Uh oh! Read more"

"Fallout 76 Veterans Chose Friendship Over Fights, Much To The Devs' Surprise","As you might expect, the Fallout TV series on Prime Video has sent a lot of new and returning players to Fallout 76 . But not even Bethesda could have predicted the warm welcome that these newcomers received from the preexisting players in the game. While speaking with The Game Business , Fallout 76 creative director John Rush expressed his shock at the cooperative spirit and sense of camaraderie that's emerged in the game. ""I'd say a lot of the onboarding was done by our wonderful community who was recognizing all of these fresh vault dwellers emerging from Vault 76 and setting up camps outside of that and giving them free stuff and showing them things and 'look at what I built,'"" said Rush. ""So it was very much a concerted effort between us and our community welcoming this new influx of brand-new players and returning players alike."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Is Mewgenics Coming To Console? Here's What We Know,"Mewgenics is out now on PC, and it's crushing it. The game not only scored positive reviews, but is racking up thousands of concurrent players and has already made enough money to recoup its development budget after just 180 minutes of availability. But is the game coming to console? No official announcements have been made, but developer Edmund McMillen said back in October 2025 that console ports are coming ""next year,"" referring to 2026. That's all there is to go on at this stage, so it remains to be seen which specific console platforms may be supported. McMillen's most famous game, 2010's Super Meat Boy, was released on console at launch for Xbox 360, before coming to PS4 in 2015, Wii U in 2016, and Switch in 2018. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Mewgenics Makes Back Its Budget In Just 180 Minutes,"Mewgenics, the newly released independent roguelike from Super Meat Boy's Edmund McMillen and Bombernaut's Tyler Glaiel, did not need very long at all to recoup its development costs. Glaiel said on social media that Mewgenics made back its development budget in just 180 minutes, or three hours, following its launch today, February 10. The game's budget has not been publicized, but in any event, it certainly seems like Mewgenics is off to a good start. On Steam, the game stands at 61,000+ concurrent users right now . It's close to becoming the most successful launch of McMillen's career, on Steam at least. That record still belongs to The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth , a remake of the roguelite original, that peaked at just over 70,000 players concurrent at launch. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Helldivers 2's Invasion Of A Super-Tough, Socialist-Loving World Isn't Going Well","Helldivers 2's Machinery of Oppression update is tasking Super Earth's finest with conquering the ""dark heart of socialism"" and so far, things are not going well. The second phase of the invasion of the Automaton homeworld of Cyberstan tasks Helldivers with slaying 700 million Automaton forces in the next day or so in order to clear the way for a full-scale invasion. That part is going well enough, with players as of writing having already defeated well over 270 million Automatons. It's the other part of the operation that is looking dicey. As part of the invasion, the entire Helldivers 2 community collectively has 200 million lives in order to conquer Cyberstan. Just a few hours after the update went live, the community has already lost more than half of that number, with around 94 million lives remaining currently. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Firing up Overwatch will put you in line to enter the game, with players reporting that upon reaching the front of the queue, they're given an error message and kicked all the way back.

SpongeBob Owner Refuses To Give Up Pursuit Of Batman Owner,"Despite repeated rejections from Warner Bros.

Unravel Is Still Leaving An Impact A Decade After Launch,"Unravel celebrated its 10-year anniversary on February 9, 2025. Below, we look back on the tiny passion project and speak with a developer about how it came together. During EA's E3 2015 press conference, Coldwood Studios' Martin Sahlin came out on stage and revealed a cute platformer called Unravel . As he revealed Yarny's handcrafted origins and spoke about the heart and passion Coldwood had in creating this new experience, you could hear and see him growing more emotional. It wasn't an E3 flub, but a reminder that the industry is at its best when developers have space to make games they love. Unravel turned 10 years old on February 9. I still remember the game's impassioned reveal and how I had such a wonderful time playing. Revisiting Unravel at its surprisingly distinct sequel ahead of this anniversary, I was taken aback by how refreshing these yarn-filled adventures were. I was even more excited to learn that some of the team is reuniting to work on a new game launching later this year. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Firewatch Helped Pioneer A Genre That Burned Brightly But Briefly,"Firewatch celebrated its 10-year anniversary on February 9, 2025. Below, we examine the origins of the so-called ""walking simulator"" and why the fire appears to have died out. When Firewatch launched on February 9th, 2016, it was easy to relate to the game's leads, Henry and Delilah. These characters spent a summer staring down as fire spread, slowly filling the forest around their watchtowers with smoke. Observers of the ""walking sim"" genre saw a similar blaze burn across the decade. It began with Dear Esther, sparked to scorching flame with the friction of Gone Home's release, and became a towering creative inferno with modern classics like Firewatch and What Remains of Edith Finch. As the 2010s came to a close, fans expected the fire to continue raging through the '20s. Instead, it burned out. A decade after Campo Santo released this deeply human game about paranoia in a national park, walking sims have fallen from mainstream prominence. It's not that no one is making them anymore--there are tiny indies available on platforms like itch.io . But the teams that made the defining games have spun their wheels, sold their studios, or split. And The Game Awards nominations have dried up, too. Despelote is the only game in the genre to receive recognition this decade with two nods, compared to five for Firewatch, three noms and one win for Edith Finch, a Games for Impact nod for Sunset, and a Best Independent Game nomination for The Vanishing of Ethan Carter--all in a three-year span. In the 2010s, every year or two saw the release of an iconic, widely discussed entry, but we're six years into the 2020s and still waiting. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Disney's New CEO Teases Future Fortnite Collaborations, Including Movie Premieres","The Walt Disney Company's new CEO, Josh D'Amaro, has further discussed the company's $1.5 billion investment into Fortnite .

Fortnite Ramps Up Anti-Cheat Efforts With New Requirements For PC Tourneys,"Epic Games is adding a new anti-cheat requirement for Fortnite tournaments for PC players, though it's not something most folks are going to have to worry about. Starting February 19, those who want to play in Fortnite tournaments on PC will have to have IOMMU protection (input-output memory management) enabled, in addition to the previously required SecureBoot and TPM. The good news is that most everyone playing on Windows 11 will already have this enabled, since it's typically enabled by default on compatible motherboards. IOMMU, like TPM, is another method to protect against cheaters using hardware cheats, while the Easy Anti-Cheat application handles the software side of things. Note that this new requirement is just for tournaments. IOMMU is not required if you're just playing casual or ranked Battle Royale with your friends. If you try to play a tournament while IOMMU is off, you won't be banned--the game simply won't let you play. Learn about how to enable IOMMU here . The topic of cheating in Fortnite has been a common one since Epic unbanned past cheaters a year ago to give them a second chance--since then, players on social media often baselessly claim the move has led to a cheating epidemic. Meanwhile, Epic has been taking legal action against cheaters and forcing them to apologize publicly several times over the past year. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Hearthstone Cataclysm Card Reveal - Ultraxion Looks Like A Must-Have For Deathwing Decks,"Hearthstone's Cataclysm expansion is just over a month away, and that means it's time for Blizzard to begin unveiling the cards we can expect to shake up the meta in the coming months. We're kicking off reveal season with an exclusive look at the dragon lord Ultraxion. Ultraxion is a 6-mana 6/7 minion, aligned with the Deathwing classes, and it comes with a pair of big effects. Its Battlecry effect will Herald your Colossal minion and reduce Deathwing's cost by 1. But on top of that, if you've strengthened Ultraxion itself with other Herald minions, you can improve the cost-reduction effect as well. Ultraxion in Hearthstone's Cataclysm expansion The Cataclysm expansion imagines a world in which Deathwing was victorious, and Murozond pulled this victorious version of Deathwing into the world of Hearthstone. Naturally some of the classes align with Deathwing, while others align with Chromie, the dragon aspect who gathers her dragonflight against him. The new Herald keyword is used by Deathwing-aligned cards and has stacking effects the more you play. Each Herald card you play has an immediate effect on the board, while also strengthening your class's Colossal minion, and powering up Deathwing's cataclysm effect. Colossal minions, powerful Legendaries that spread their stats across several bodies on the board, make their return from 2022's Sunken City expansion. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
The Last Of Us Season 3 Was Going To Bring Back Catherine O'Hara,"Catherine O'Hara played Gail in The Last of Us Season 2, and she was planned to return for Season 3 before her recent passing. Gail is Joel's therapist in Season 2, and the role was created for the TV show. Gail was a supporting character in Season 2, and while she didn't have all that many scenes, the time she was on screen was memorable due to O'Hara's impressive performance. ""I don't think it's a big spoiler to say that she was gonna be in our show again, because of course she was,"" Mazin said in an appearance on the Scriptnotes podcast ( via GamesRadar ). ""She's so good. But she was stolen from all of us. The thing that's upsetting me is I don't get to see her in other stuff. I don't care about my show. I wanted to see her in other things, cause what else was gonna happen?"" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
That New Ridiculously Easy Mode In Final Fantasy 7 Remake Is Coming To Rebirth,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will become much easier to complete on PC and PS5 when the RPG arrives June 3 on Switch 2 and Xbox .

Why Resident Evil’s Most Painfully Awkward Hero Is Actually Its Best,"If there’s one thing Resident Evil is known for, outside of zombies, it’s action heroes with impeccable hair and impressive catalogs of one-liners. Who could ever forget fending off hordes of crazed villagers in Resident Evil 4, only to have Leon say, “Where’s everyone going, bingo?” There’s an edge of “cool” that has become integral to Resident Evil over the decades, but after the debacle of Resident Evil 6, Capcom knew it had to do something different. Ethan Winters is not cool. He’s more the absence of cool than anything--a dad joke dressed up as an action hero. But perhaps what’s most amazing is how all that invariably turns him into one of the most compelling protagonists of the series’ history. Ethan is likable in spite of himself, and a surprisingly meaningful piece of the puzzle in how Resident Evil 7 and Village redefined the franchise’s tone while still keeping its heart alive. Sometimes, horror games don’t need an action hero; they just need a dude. Ethan isn’t a highly trained specialist, he’s not a member of an anti-terrorist organization, or even a cop--he’s a systems engineer. Oh, you didn’t know he’s a systems engineer? That’s because the game itself never tells you that. Perhaps the most apt way to define Ethan Winters is as Resident Evil’s “wife guy.” What I mean by that is that Ethan’s entire identity is tied to his relationships, along with the driving force behind all of his actions. For all intents and purposes, Ethan really is just some guy--a milquetoast middle-of-the-road average dude who just happened to fall in love with and marry a woman who worked on horrific bioweapons. But in a world where zombie apocalypses happen every few years, maybe that’s not so weird. Mia is the one wrapped up in the ongoing soap opera about freakish creatures; Ethan’s just along for the ride. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
This Tactics Game Takes The Baldur's Gate 3 Approach To Tabletop RPG Adaptation,"There are two ways developers can go with a tabletop-game-to-video-game adaptation. They can go the Gloomhaven route, and directly recreate the tabletop game in digital form, or they can go in Baldur's Gate 3's direction by taking the world, lore, and general vibe as inspiration for a whole new experience. Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent follows that second option. Announced today by The Dungeon of Naheulbeuk: The Amulet of Chaos developer Artefacts Studio and Waven publisher New Tales, Terrinoth is a tactical RPG based on Fantasy Flight Games' Descent tabletop universe, more specifically Descent: Legends of the Dark . Ahead of its announcement, GameSpot had the chance to play two early missions in Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent and speak to its developers, and we learned why Artefacts Studio took the road traveled by Baldur's Gate 3 and not Gloomhaven. The party screen seen between missions in Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent is technically a prequel to Descent: Legends of the Dark, following a ragtag group of tabletop RPG character-archetype clichés as they fight off thieves, undead, vampires, and other evil forces ravaging the titular world. While the original tabletop game has players placing tiles to build dungeons and frequently interfacing with a mobile companion app, Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent is a tactical RPG with an original story and neither of those features.

"Monster Hunter Wilds Will Get ""Large-Scale Expansion,"" Similar To Sunbreak And Iceborne","Capcom has confirmed that support for Monster Hunter Wilds isn't ending anytime soon, as a major expansion is in the works for the action-RPG. Ryozo Tsujimoto, the game's producer, stated that the DLC will be similar in scope to Sunbreak for Monster Hunter Rise and Iceborne for Monster Hunter World . The announcement came during a first anniversary video for Monster Hunter Wilds on YouTube . Tsujimoto added that more details will be divulged for the ""large-scale expansion"" this summer.

Ashley Johnson Reacts To The Last Of Us Season 2 Backlash,"Ashley Johnson famously played Ellie in Naughty Dog's The Last of Us games, and now she's reacted to the criticisms of Season 2 of the HBO series. Speaking to The Direct , Johnson said the series has ""very passionate"" fans, and this can go both ways in terms of sentiment. ""Sometimes that passion feels really great, and sometimes it feels not great. But you know, I understand it. I understand loving something so much, and wanting it to be what you want it to be,"" she said. The HBO series makes many changes from the games, and showrunner and writer Craig Mazin said before Season 2 even came out that he expected fans to revolt. Regarding fan feedback in general, Mazin said he is only trying to do what is right for the story, even if people don't like it. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Arc Raiders Pushes Cooperation Over PvP In New Shared Watch Event,"Arc Raiders players are being encouraged to team up for increased merits in Shared Watch, a new limited-time event designed to remind fans that the Arc machines are the real enemy. This launches alongside the new 1.15.0 update, patch notes for which you can see below. From now until February 24, PvP encounters won't generate any merits for players. Instead, players can earn merits by damaging and destroying Arc machines, or by assisting in their destruction. This event will debut two new cosmetic sets: The Vulpine set and The Slugger set. Additionally, Cold Snap has been added back to the rotation of outdoor map conditions. The intense cold can inflict frostbite damage on players if they linger too long, but there are greater rewards for those who take the risk. Players can also lob snowballs at each other.

"New Game From Valheim Devs, Begraved, Now Has A Demo","Valheim is still in early access five years after its debut, but a small handful of devs behind that game are now ready to debut the demo for their next title, Begraved . This first-person co-op dungeon-crawler is available on Steam , and the creative team is looking for some feedback. Begraved is the first game from Grip Jaw, an independent studio formed by Valheim creative director Robin Eyre, vice president Emilia Oscarsson, and designer Andreas Tomasson. Players are cast as Gravebound, lost souls whose debt to the Taxman extends beyond the grave. To escape their crushing obligations, they are forced to enter cursed tombs in an attempt to survive long enough to escape with any loot they can carry. But some treasures require two hands to handle, and that's going to make it hard to evade the angry spirits you've unleashed by stealing from them. Begraved's tombs are procedurally generated areas with support for five-player co-op and proximity voice chat. The current build of the game supports both solo and co-opt playthroughs in two complete zones, with upgrades and hideouts already incorporated into the game. The eventual 1.0 release will include two additional zones, as well as new enemies, relics, and afflictions. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Next Game From Split Fiction Team Cooking Now, Will Be ""Really Delicious,"" Dev Says","After announcing a year ago that Hazelight had ""already started"" development on its next game , it seems things are continuing to progress. ""We're back in the kitchen, cookin' up something really delicious!"" Hazelight said in a social media post.

Uwe Boll Is Making His Own New House Of The Dead Movie And Wants You To Pay For It,"Much like the undead, Uwe Boll's film directing career shambles on, with the purveyor of schlock announcing a crowdfunding campaign for an unofficial sequel to his maligned 2003 House of the Dead adaptation. Boll launched an Indiegogo campaign (spotted by GamesRadar ) for his new film, 23 Years Later: Return to Zombie Island. As Boll laments, he can't name the movie ""House of the Dead"" because ""they're making a $50 million House of the Dead movie with somebody else,"" referring to the Paul W.S. Anderson-directed film that recently cast The Last of Us star Isabela Merced . ""It's pissing me so off, that I would say, give us the money, produce the film with us, buy some of the perks,"" Boll said in his signature unfiltered cadence. ""We will really compete with that other movie."" Boll characterizes his 2003 movie as ""the most hated video game-based movie ever"" that turned ""into a total cult classic."" The film scored 15 on GameSpot's sister site Metacritic , indicating ""overwhelming dislike,"" and sports a ""generally unfavorable"" 2.2 user score. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Speaking to IGN , Patrick Soderlund said he was ""so upset"" that Arc Raiders launched with a minimal roster of instruments--today, the game has shakers, a recorder, and an acoustic guitar.

Control Resonant Does Not Use Generative AI,"Remedy's next big game, Control Resonant , does not utilize generative AI, according to the company's interim CEO. Markus Mäki said during Remedy's latest earnings briefing that there is ""varied interest"" in the technology at the company, however.

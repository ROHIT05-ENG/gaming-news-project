Horses review,"One thing that's probably got a bit lost in all the controversy preceding Horses' release is the fact it's surprisingly funny. Its humour is pitch black, yes, and its comedic moments often dance on a knife's edge between laughter and revulsion, but writer and director Andrea Lucco Borlera's first-person narrative horror - his debut game, created in close collaboration with Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione - is a fascinatingly singular vision. It's singular enough, in fact, that it's not an easy thing to effectively describe, but if you can imagine a sort of thematic reinterpretation of Animal Farm by way of Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salo on one side, and a meme-able Garry's Mod video on the other, then Horses gleefully oscillates between them, landing somewhere in the middle.

Metroid Prime 4: Beyond review,"Taken as a whole, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond feels like something of a composite. On one hand, it is clearly a follow-up to 2007's Metroid Prime 3: Corruption , drawing close many of that game's greatest triumphs and fumbles with a fascinating reverence. On the other, it is something new for the series, structurally most comparable not to other Metroid games but rather to a different Nintendo adventure franchise (more on that shortly). Then there is how the game is built, feeling almost modular, with different modes and moods of play stitched together with visible seams. With all that said, it certainly - at least broadly - works rather well. Read more"

The movie grossed only $142 million worldwide and received lukewarm critical reception at best. Audience reviews have been kinder, and while the film may not have reached the same heights as the original Tron or 2010's Tron: Legacy, there is still appreciation for how it pushes the franchise's concepts further and for its hard-hitting Nine Inch Nails soundtrack. Unlike the Tron movies, which were set on the digital frontier of the Grid, Tron: Ares explores the ramifications of that world crossing over into ours. Centered around Ares, a highly sophisticated Program, the movie chronicles the first meeting between humanity and digital AI beings. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Games Weren't A Big Part Of Netflix's Attempted WB Takeover,"Last week, Netflix put forth an $82 million deal to purchase Warner Bros. Studios , one of the biggest movie and TV studios in the world. Warner Bros. also has a considerable place in the video game industry with franchises like Batman, Harry Potter, and Mortal Kombat under its domain. However, one Netflix executive has now acknowledged that Warner Bros.' gaming division wasn't a significant factor in considering its bid. During a Netflix conference call about the potential WB sale, co-CEO Gregory K. Peters expressed some eagerness to exploit the video game franchises under Warner Bros. in the future. But he added that the games were ""relatively minor"" in the company's initial plans and that it may be ""worth going back again to sort of how we thought about the deal and building our valuation model."" ""While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn’t attribute any value to that from the get-go because they're relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things,"" continued Peters. ""Now we are super excited because some of those properties that they've built--[Hogwarts Legacy] is a great example of that--have been done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we're offering. They've got great studios and great folks working there. So we think that there's definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven't built that into our deal model.""

"The Game Awards Creator Hears Your Feedback --""Do We Always Get It Right? No""","The Game Awards host and organizer Geoff Keighley has opened up on the challenges of running a show that aims to celebrate games and the people who make them while also acknowledging the challenging times people in the industry today are facing. So far in 2025, numerous developers lost their jobs , Microsoft canceled games , and the industry further consolidated with EA announcing plans to sell itself to Saudi Arabia. Speaking to The Game Business , Keighley said the introduction of the Game Changer award in 2024 was an initial attempt to address this. Amir Satvat was given the prize for his work to support people who were laid off in the gaming industry. Keighley hasn't said if this award is coming back in 2025, but it would be a glaring omission if it did not.

"Sony's PS5 ""Must-Play"" Games Of 2026 Video Includes Halo But Not GTA 6","After 25 years of being exclusive on console to Xbox, Microsoft's Halo series is headed to PlayStation in 2026 with Halo: Campaign Evolved . With the year coming to a close, Sony has published a video highlighting some of the ""must-play"" titles coming to PS5 in 2026, and Halo got a special shoutout in the video, while GTA 6 was not mentioned. Seeing Halo promoted so heavily by Sony would have been unthinkable not long ago, and the comments on the video reflect this. The top comment on the video states, ""Seeing Halo here is still surreal."" Someone else said, ""It feels so weird seeing Halo being advertised by PlayStation."" Others have pointed out that Rockstar's GTA 6 is not mentioned in the video, with people taking this to mean, or suggest, that Sony is concerned that Rockstar could push the game to 2027. But there could be any number of reasons why GTA 6 was left out. Rockstar, after all, is highly protective of its own game assets. To be sure, it is a giant leap to say that GTA 6 not being featured in video means the game won't make it out on time in 2026. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

As players prep for this month's upcoming Expedition--an optional wipe that resets much of their progress in exchange for in-game rewards--they'll also be treated to the fresh Cold Snap update.

WoW Player Houses Are Now Officially Allowed To Fly,"World of Warcraft players are pushing the game's new player-housing system to its limit, including defying the laws of gravity in a way Blizzard never intended. But rather than fix the ability to send houses skyward, Blizzard is instead embracing it. When housing first arrived on December 2 as part of patch 11.2.7, it didn't take long for players to discover that, while the UI didn't show it, houses could actually be lifted off the ground using keybinds. The result was players making all kinds of airborne housing creations, including elaborate treehouses, airships, mechs, homes held up by kites, and everything in between. In a forum post , WoW community manager Randy Jordan (aka Kaivax) stated that instead of fixing the ability to elevate houses, Blizzard has with this week's scheduled maintenance actually made it easier by enabling proper controls to move houses upward.

Sony Might Have Leaked Leon Kennedy In Resident Evil Requiem,"While we're still a couple of months away from Resident Evil Requiem's release, it looks like there could be a surprise return awaiting fans. Before it was removed, the PlayStation Store revealed new cover art for the game that featured longtime Resident Evil protagonist Leon Kennedy. PlayStation 5 players noticed the art on the pre-download screen for owners of the standard (non-Deluxe) version of the game. IGN later confirmed the art , which showed a stubbled and haggard-looking Leon hovering over Requiem's other main protagonist, Grace Ashcroft. Leon appeared similar to his Resident Evil 4 look, with his fur-lined leather jacket, albeit a bit more grizzled. High-res image of the official Leon S.

Official Nintendo Switch 2 Wheel Set For Mario Kart Gets First Discount At Amazon,"Nintendo Switch 2 Wheel Set for Joy-Con 2 $21.49 (was $25) See at Amazon See at Target If you're one of the many holiday shoppers who took advantage of last week's Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle promotion , you should check out this week's deal on the racing wheel attachment set.

Nintendo Switch 2 Wheel Set for Joy-Con 2 $21.49 (was $25) The official Nintendo Switch 2 Wheel Set comes with one light blue and one red attachment that match the color scheme of the Joy-Con 2 controllers.

See at Amazon See at Target Considering the popularity of the Mario Kart World bundle deal, which ended on Sunday, it wouldn't be surprising if Amazon and Target sold out of this deal.

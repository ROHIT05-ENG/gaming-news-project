Brilliantly cinematic supernatural thrill ride Ghost Town is finally on PSVR 2 and it's easily one of my favourite games this year,"It took about five seconds to figure out Ghost Town might be something a bit special when I first played it earlier this year. Before you even hit the 'start' option, you're transported to a dingy, moonlit South London car park in the driving rain. Fog drifts over litter-strewn tarmac, police sirens wail unseen in the distance, a concrete council block looms overhead, and just for a moment - even though I've not lived in London for over a decade - it felt a little like coming home. I've got a lot of good things to say about Ghost Town - it's easily one of my favourite games this year - but more than anything, its sense of time and place is utterly transporting. Read more"

"Blue Prince Didn't Use Any AI, Says Publisher","Over the weekend, The Indie Game Awards shook up its winner's circle by stripping Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 of its Game of the Year Award over the publisher's use of AI.

It is the result of eight years of development [fueled] by imagination and creativity, and we are extremely proud of what Tonda has achieved.""

"Arc Raiders Is My Game Of The Year, But Its Use Of Generative AI Really Sucks","These past two months with Arc Raiders have been the most fun I've had with games all year. It represents the most exciting and unpredictable multiplayer landscape I've jumped into since Sea of Thieves in 2018, which I consider my favorite game ever made. It's safe to say I really love Arc Raiders. But it's become difficult to fully espouse those feelings as we learn about Embark Studio's use of generative AI. According to the studio, Arc Raiders' voice acting was initially performed by humans, then used to ""train"" AI so that it could speak in the actors' voices while addressing any possible circumstance. For Embark, the team doesn't need to bring in the voice actors each time new content is added to the game. The AI voices learn to speak in the voices of the actors, which the actors are said to have agreed upon when they were hired, and the tools take it from there. Maybe it shouldn't have come as a surprise, since the team's previous game, The Finals, uses generative AI in a similar way. In an interview , Embark assured players that the game's visual artwork is entirely human-made, but admitted to using this text-to-speech training to bring voices to the game's shop NPCs, emotes, and other character barks. Knowing this has left me conflicted when I think to sing the game's praises. On one hand, I can't deny the hold Arc Raiders has taken over me. The heart wants what the heart wants, and Embark's extraction shooter, rich in emergent, player-driven drama, has lit my heart on fire in a way few games ever have. At the same time, I've already written my review . Though it was a glowing one that I don't regret, I also feel it's my job to call out this disappointing practice. In recent weeks, similar practices or plans have arisen in several high-profile examples. Larian Studios' boss vouched for it in some cases. Nexon's former CEO said AI is about to rewrite everything in the games industry. Ubisoft announced it's using an AI tool to help write its games in some instances. Even Hideo Kojima, often considered a unique voice in the industry, says he uses it at times . It's being presented as not just helpful, but inevitable. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
More Tomb Raider Ports May Be Coming To Switch 2,"Last month, Aspyr shadow-dropped the Switch and Switch 2 versions of Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition , the 2013 reboot that kicked off a new era for Lara Croft.

Aspyr product manager Jordon Reese was recently asked by Nintendo Everything about the possibility of the other Survivor trilogy games-- Rise of the Tomb Raider and Shadow of the Tomb Raider --coming to Switch 2. Reese didn't directly confirm those titles, but he also seemed to leave the door open for them. ""We've successfully brought back the classic era [Tomb Raider 1-6] and now the origin story of Lara Croft to modern Nintendo platforms,"" said Reese. ""We can't announce anything at the moment, but the passionate response to this release is strong encouragement for us to continue exploring those possibilities."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Expedition 33 Actor Says The Game Awards Best Performance Award Doesn't Credit Everyone,"The actor who provided the motion capture for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's Gustave has spoken out to say it would be ""more logical"" to have a Best Character category at awards shows to help give credit to everyone who contributed to bringing a character to life in a game. The actor, Maxence Cazorla, is saying this against the backdrop of only one person, voice actor Charlie Cox, being nominated for Best Performance at The Game Awards for the role of Gustave. For what it's worth, Cox was open in acknowledging that Cazorla deserved credit, too , and Cazorla said Cox was kind to say that. Cox did not end up winning Best Performance, as it was Jennifer English as Maelle from Expedition 33 who took home the award . In any event, Cazorla told Eurogamer that he believes a ""Best Character category feels more logical"" than ""isolating a single performer and potentially leaving others invisible."" Whether or not this is something that host and organizer Geoff Keighley is considering for next year's The Game Awards is unknown. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Microsoft Denies Report About Increased Profit-Margin Goals At Xbox,"Microsoft has reacted to a report that said the company is pushing Xbox to make more profit.

"Paramount Sweetens Its Offer For Warner Bros., Including Massive Guarantee From Larry Ellison","Despite Netflix announcing a deal with Warner Bros.

A new film in the series, Evil Dead: Burn, is on the way, but until then, you can check out one of the creepiest entries in the saga with this new Evil Dead: Rise Limited Edition 4K Blu-ray . While the film was released on Blu-ray in 2023, this new version is being distributed by Arrow Video and will launch on January 13. Preorders are discounted to $35 (was $50) at Amazon. Evil Dead: Rise Limited Edition (4K Blu-ray) $35 (was $50) | Releases January 13, 2026 Like its other releases, Arrow Video's Evil Dead: Rise Blu-ray comes with several brand-new extras.

Once again, the cursed Necronomicon features prominently in a tale about estranged sisters, giving rise to flesh-possessing demons and forcing one family to take on the most nightmarish version of motherhood imaginable. If you don't feel like waiting for the new Arrow Video version of Evil Dead: Rise, you can pick up the older Blu-rays from Amazon. It's worth noting that the 4K and standard Blu-rays come with no special features whatsoever, but if you want the movies on their own, these are cheap alternatives. We'd still recommend waiting for the Arrow Video release, given that the price difference is slight and you're getting much content in return. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

It's still 2v2 basketball, but Midway added a third player to each team, allowing you to make substitutions throughout each game. The Tournament Edition also expanded player stat categories. NBA Hangtime was developed by the same team at Midway, just with a different title because the NBA Jam moniker was sold to Acclaim Entertainment. Midway once again expanded the rosters to five players and introduced a custom player creator, but NBA Hangtime is still very much an NBA Jam game. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"Nex Playground Boss Says The Console Solves The Wii ""Problem""","While Sony and Nintendo have expanded their lead over Xbox, a dark horse console had a very strong showing in third place in November. The Nex Playground has emerged as a breakout hit, and CEO David Lee believes that one of the reasons why its been so successful is because the console has solved the Wii ""problem."" Nearly two decades ago, the Wii powered Nintendo's post-GameCube comeback with its motion controls and unique games. Lee argues that the scope of Wii's success made it difficult to sustain in the long term. Instead of trying to sell games like Wii, Nex Playground is offering its titles as part of a subscription service. ""One of the most important things we should do is learn from history and try not to commit the same limitations, and that's why we have a subscription model,"" Lee told The Game Business . ""Nintendo expanded the audience with Wii. When you expand the audience, and they want different things, and they only buy Wii Fit, Wii Sports and not many others … that's a bit of a problem.""

Save Up To 25% On The Akira Manga Hardcover Edition,"Akira Hardcover Collection Save Up To 25% See all volumes at Amazon Any list gathering up the best that anime has to offer will inevitably include Akira, and for good reason. The 1988 movie raised the bar for film animation and is widely credited with introducing mainstream audiences outside Japan to the medium. However, the anime adaptation is only part of the tale. Like innumerable other anime projects, Akira is adapted from a much longer--though lesser-known--manga series. While the Akira manga has been available in print for decades, a new Akira Hardcover Edition kicked off earlier in 2025, offering the most authentic presentation of Katsuhiro Otomo's groundbreaking sci-fi saga. If you've ever wanted to experience the full Akira saga, this is one of the best ways to do so--and as luck would have it, you can save a few dollars on these premium hardcover releases. Four volumes in the six-volume series are available to purchase at Amazon , and while these normally cost between $30 and $40, you can get them for up 25% off. Volumes 5 and 6 are also launching in the coming weeks , and preorders are live. Akira Hardcover Collection Save Up To 25% The Akira Hardcover books published by Kodansha use the updated translation and lettering of the 35th Anniversary Edition box set, and each book is presented as a large-sized 7"" x 10"" collectible. Like traditional manga, they are read from right to left, and the original Japanese-language hand-drawn sound effects from the manga have been restored. Each hardcover book has cover artwork based on the original manga tankabon volume artwork. As mentioned above, four volumes have launched so far, and are currently discounted to roughly $26 - $27 at Amazon (normally $30 - $35 each). The next release, Akira Hardcover Collection 5, releases on December 23. Preorders are discounted to $34 (down from $36).

All six volumes come bundled together with the hardcover Akira Club art book and an exclusive pill patch. It's currently sold out, but it gets restocked periodically at Amazon, so it's worth checking back to see if it's available. Set in a dark future timeline, Akira first began publication in 1982 and ran for 120 chapters. Taking place in the post-apocalyptic city of Neo-Tokyo, the series examines the after-effects of a mysterious explosion that almost destroyed the city. Thirty years later, teenage biker gang leader Shotaro Kaneda finds himself in the middle of a plot that involves militant revolutionaries, psychically gifted individuals, military forces, and his childhood friend, Tetsuo Shima, who has begun to develop dangerously destructive psychic powers of his own. Akira manga was critically acclaimed for its mature themes, well-developed characters, intriguing storylines, and Otomo's artwork. In the years since its publication, it's become regarded as one of the pioneering works in the then-burgeoning Cyberpunk sci-fi subgenre. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

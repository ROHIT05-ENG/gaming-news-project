Watch This Ridiculous 70-person Super Mario 64 Relay,"This year marks the 30th anniversary of Super Mario 64 , a game that was designed to be a single-player showcase for the Nintendo 64.

Bushiroad Corporation's CEO and president, Takaaki Kidani, sold his shares to the company (via Automaton ). This followed Pocketpair's formation of Palworld Entertainment, a new company arm dedicated to maximizing Palworld's merchandising opportunities. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Download The Hytale Launcher Now, As Hypixel Estimates ""Over 1 Million"" Players At Launch","Hytale has been on quite a development journey. After being acquired and subsequently shuttered by Riot Games, the original development team bought the Minecraft rival back and recommenced development in November 2025. On January 13, the title goes into early access, which the team acknowledges will be unpolished and full of bugs. Still, Hypixel--the developer behind one of the most popular Minecraft servers of all time--is expecting mammoth launch-day numbers, estimating ""over 1 million"" players. To that end, the studio is encouraging users to download the game's launcher ahead of time in order. Hypixel's CEO, Simon Collins-Laflamme, posted on X stating, ""We expect over 1 million players on the early access release day for Hytale ... Please download the launcher today and log in now to help us significantly reduce launch-day stress."" Hypixel's preorders have been open since early December, so the team has had around a month to gauge interest, meaning this player estimate is based on those figures and not just speculation. Hypixel has already allowed mod creators early access to the game so they can research and develop the best Hytale mods for the early access release. Modders are adding new game modes, cosmetics, items, and quality-of-life improvements to the game, with more being added daily. When the game launches tomorrow, January 13, all of those mods will be available via Curseforge thanks to an agreement between the modding platform and Hypixel Studios. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Diablo 4 Leaderboards Are Coming,"Leaderboards have previously been a part of the Diablo franchise, and starting today, they're back. Blizzard is releasing a new Diablo 4 update across all platforms that reintroduces leaderboards as well as the multi-level dungeons known as The Tower. Blizzard's official site states that The Tower and the leaderboards are both in beta, with more refinements to come in future seasons. The leaderboards will be divided by the seven playable classes--Paladin, Rogue, Druid, Barbarian, Sorcerer, Necromancer, and Spiritborn. Additionally, the leaderboard rankings will only be set for two weeks periods rather than the entire season. Essentially, everyone gets a chance for a fresh start while Blizzard works out any kinks in the system. The leaderboard's rankings are directly linked to The Tower as players' scores are tabulated based on their performance when fighting monsters and bosses. Experienced players with refined character builds should be right at home in the chaos. For less experienced players, The Tower provides enhanced damage levels when players destroy the numerous pylons in the complex. That may not be the equal of having incredibly powerful characters, but it means that players of all skill levels are far from helpless against the onslaught of creatures coming for them in The Tower.

Nintendo's Switch Game Voucher Program Will End Permanently This Month,"Nintendo is discontinuing the sale of Switch Game Vouchers, a program that allowed Nintendo Switch Online members to get a discount on first-party Switch games by purchasing two game vouchers for $100. While existing vouchers will remain valid, no new vouchers will be sold after January 30, 2026. With precious few discounts available for first-party Switch games, Nintendo's game vouchers allowed players to save a little cash by purchasing two vouchers for $100, saving $10 per game as long as both were $60 titles. While the program had a few caveats, including a one-year expiry and the requirement of an active Nintendo Switch Online membership, it offered a reliable discount on first-party games. If you want to take advantage of this discount one last time, game vouchers will still be sold until January 30, and will stay valid for one year after the date of purchase. You can also check the expiry date on any unused vouchers through the Nintendo Switch Online section of your Nintendo account. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Baldur's Gate 3 Won't Be Coming To Switch 2,"In October 2025, rumors suggested that Larian Studios' hit RPG Baldur's Gate 3 could be getting a port for Nintendo's Switch 2 . Unfortunately, that report has turned out to be inaccurate as Larian has confirmed that its wildly popular D&D will not be coming to Nintendo's console. During a recent AMA session on Reddit , Baldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke acknowledged that the company wanted to work on a Switch 2 port, but it was denied. ""We would have loved to [bring Baldur's Gate 3 to Switch 2], but [it] wasn't our decision to make,"" wrote Vincke. That likely means the port was either shot down by Nintendo or by Hasbro/Wizards of the Coast, which controls the rights for all things Dungeons & Dragons-related. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Disney Pixar Luxo Jr. Lego Set On Sale For The First Time At Amazon,"Lego Ideas: Disney Pixar Luxo Jr. (613 Pieces) $63 (was $70) See at Amazon Pixar fans can save 10% on Lego's 613-piece model of Luxo Jr. and the Pixar Ball. Normally $70, Lego Ideas: Disney Pixar Luxo Jr. is on sale for $63. Lego's recreation of the iconic Pixar mascot launched last June and has rarely budged from its MSRP. The current discount is the best we've seen for the set, but it's not marked as an official deal. Over the past few weeks, Luxo Jr.'s price on Amazon has sometimes changed multiple times in a single day, so we wouldn't be surprised if the the price has changed again by the time you read this story. Lego Ideas: Disney Pixar Luxo Jr. (613 Pieces) $63 (was $70) The 613-piece replica of Luxo Jr. measures 5.5 x 4 x 11 inches--though Luxo Jr.'s height varies based on how you pose it. Luxo Jr. can stand next to the buildable Pixar Ball or balance on top of it by making a couple of simple adjustments. Lego designed Luxo Jr. as a fully articulated model capable of being displayed in poses from the iconic Pixar production logo and short film starring the semi-anthropomorphic lamp. The light bulb doesn't actually work, but Lego did a good job of making it look realistic. As a Lego model, Luxo Jr. is quite different than the vast majority of Disney Pixar building sets. Designed for experienced builders and collectors, the model has an interesting build process thanks to its multi-hinged arm, modifiable base, and the many Easter Eggs Lego worked into the authentic recreation. There are dozens of references to Pixar movies hidden throughout the Luxo Jr. and Pixar Ball builds. For instance, the Pizza Planet truck from the first Toy Story movie is included inside the light bulb. The lamp's base has a miniature build referencing Marlin & Dory from Finding Nemo as well as clever allusions to Inside Out, Cars, Coco, WALL-E, A Bug's Life--and possibly others that we missed. The instruction booklet calls out the Finding Nemo character builds as well as the mini-builds found in the Pixar Ball. The interior of the colorful ball features multiple characters from five different Pixar movies: Toy Story - Woody & Buzz Up - Carl & Russell Monsters, Inc. - Mike & Sully The Incredibles family Ratatouille - Linguini & Remy As mentioned, one of the display modes is Luxo Jr. ""deflating"" the toy ball, just like in the production logo's animation sequence. Once you remove two of the rounded plates from the ball, Luxo Jr. can connect to the top. It's a quick and easy modification. The Pixar Ball has its own buildable stand, so the model still feels stable with Luxo Jr. on the ball. See at Amazon Lego Ideas: Disney Pixar Luxo Jr. (21357) Luxo Jr. was the star of Pixar's first short film in 1986. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short, but most Pixar fans were introduced to the character when it hopped across the screen to complete the Pixar logo at the beginning of Toy Story in 1995. The short film originally only played at film festivals and conventions, but it eventually played in theaters worldwide before screenings of Toy Story 2 in 1999. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
1408 Amazon-Exclusive 4K Steelbook Edition Releases This Week,"1408 Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray) $40 | Amazon Exclusive | Releases January 13 See at Amazon Another Stephen King adaptation lands on 4K Blu-ray for the first time this week. 1408, the 2007 psychological horror movie starring John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson, releases January 13 exclusively at Amazon for $40. 1408 Limited Edition Steelbook is a three-disc set with theatrical and extended cuts of the hit film. The collectible steelbook case and slipcover have awesome original artwork; it's honestly one of the best-designed 4K Blu-ray editions of a Stephen King movie you can buy today. Based on a 1999 short story by Stephen King, 1408 follows Mike Enslin, a grief-stricken author who investigates and writes places that are allegedly haunted. His latest investigation brings him to room 1408 at the NYC hotel The Dolphin. 1408 was a pretty big hit at the box office and features terrific performances by Cusack and Jackson. 1408 Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray) $40 | Amazon Exclusive | Releases January 13 The Amazon-exclusive Limited Edition Steelbook is a three-disc set with two 4K Blu-rays and one 1080p Blu-ray. Fans can watch the original theatrical edition on 4K as well as the Director's Cut on 4K and 1080p. The Director's Cut (112m) is approximately eight minutes longer than the theatrical release (104m). The upscaled 4K Blu-ray editions support Dolby Vision and HDR10. Audio formats include Dolby Atmos and Dolby TrueHD 5.1/7.1 surround sound. The two Director's Cut discs have the special features from previous Blu-ray editions, including the three alternate endings. The theatrical 4K Blu-ray disc also has a brand-new featurette titled Don't Enter 1408. The exclusive steelbook case features new artwork by graphic designer Gary Pullin (Ghoulish Gary). The front of the case is a rendering of the door to the eponymous hotel room, while the back features protagonist Mike Enslin's daughter Katie with manuscript pages floating around her and the name of the hotel (The Dolphin). The interior artwork recreates the memorable scene inside the torn apart hotel room where Mike sinks to his knees and reaches out toward Katie. The slipcover features a stylized and modified version of the original promotional image featuring Cusack and Jackson. The new artwork looks fantastic, and it'd be great to see more limited-edition steelbooks opt for a more creative design like Lionsgate has here. 1408 Amazon Exclusive Edition Features: Exclusive steelbook case Exclusive slipcover 2 Cuts / 3 Discs Theatrical (4K) Director's (4K & 1080p) Upscaled 4K (2160p) HDR: Dolby Vision / HDR10 Audio: Dolby Atmos / Dolby TrueHD 5.1/7.1 Special Features: Don't Enter 1408 featurette (New) Audio commentary with director Mikael Håfström and writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski Alternate endings Deleted scenes with optional commentary The Secrets of 1408 (22 minutes) Behind-the-scenes look at the making of 1408.

Lego Lord Of The Rings Book Nook Gets First Discount At Amazon,"Lego Icons: Lord of the Rings - Balrog Book Nook (1,201 Pieces) $111 (was $130) See at Amazon Lord of the Rings fans can save on Lego's Balrog Book Nook for the first time at Amazon. Released last June, the 1,201-piece Lord of the Rings building set is on sale for $111 (was $130). When we first published this deal on Friday, the price was $117--a 10% discount--but now you can save 15%. Deals on Lord of the Rings Lego models are exceedingly rare, so it's cool to see this awesome and practical model on sale for a great price. The LOTR Book Nook can wedge between your various collectible editions of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit to add a fun flourish to your Tolkien shelf. Or you can open the Book Nook and display the buildable Balrog figure alongside your other Lego sets. Lego Icons: Lord of the Rings - Balrog Book Nook (1,201 Pieces) $111 (was $130) Lego picked a rather fitting scene from The Lord of the Rings for the brick-built Book Nook. The 1,201 piece model is based on Gandalf the Grey's battle with Durin's Bane in the movie adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring. Once fully built, the frame resembles the stone pillars and archways of the First and Second Halls in the Mines of Moria. The buildable stand for the Gandalf the Grey minifigure represents the narrowest point on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm. With the Book Nook closed, as shown above, the model is 5.5 x 6.5 x 9 inches and captures the moment Gandalf confidently blocks the Balrog's path and exclaims, ""You shall not pass!"" The memorable line of dialogue is quoted on the Book Nook's front plaque. Lego Gandalf wields his signature staff in one hand and Glamdring (his sword) in the other. The buildable Balrog figure is essentially an articulated action figure, because you can pose his wings, arms, hands, legs, and fingers. Balrog comes with a whip accessory, and flame elements attach to his back. Lego used flexible sheets of translucent plastic to make the wings. It's only been included with one other Lego set: the 269-piece Fell Beast, which was a purchase bonus Lego Insiders when the massive Barad-dûr building set launched in 2024. You can disconnect the bridge from each side to open the Book Nook. This alternate display mode showcases the Balrog's imposing presence with its wings fully unfurled. Flame elements decorate the left and right archways, which is a reference to the Balrog of Moria's ability to start a fire by flapping its wings. With the Book Nook fully unfolded, the wider model is 17.5 x 6.5 x 9 inches. Since neither the Balrog figure or Gandalf minifigure need to be connected to the frame, you can display them without the Lego Book Nook, too. See at Amazon Lego Icons: The Lord of the Rings - Balrog Book Nook (10367) The Movies of Middle-earth Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and more on 4K Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD See at Amazon Lego launched two other buildable book nooks the same day as the Barlog model: Harry Potter and Sherlock Holmes. The 832-piece Hogwarts Express Book Nook retails for $100 and has yet to receive a price cut. The 1,359-piece Sherlock Holmes Book Nook is $130 and is only sold at Barnes & Noble and the Lego Store. Fans of Wicked should also check out the 1,327-piece Glinda & Elphaba Bookends , which are exclusive to Target and the Lego Store, and priced at $130. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Developer Larian's fantasy RPG is, of course, a hugely beloved game, and responses to the news have been swift, strong, and not entirely positive. Feelings have also been floating around the Eurogamer office (well, it's more of a chat room, but you get the point), and, thus, the embers of this week's The Big Question were inflamed. This, for those of you new to these parts, is where we tackle a topical talking point from the week's video gaming news before flinging it over to you. Let's go! Read more"
"A love letter to NFL Blitz, one of the greatest sports games of all time","Who do you have this Sunday? Do you even care? Maybe not - this is Euro gamer after all, and one could not be blamed for not taking an interest in an American sport right now.

"Markiplier's Iron Lung movie might be getting all the attention, but the horror game it's based on is a masterclass in the power of suggestion","Perhaps you recently glanced at the internet and saw the fuss about Iron Lung. The indie horror movie got off to a rip-roaring start last week , elbowing Melania aside to take the number two spot in the US box office charts, thwarted only by Send Help, the latest from horror movie king Sam Raimi. Iron Lung's success can almost certainly be attributed to its links with mega-popular YouTuber Mark Edward Fischbach - better known as Markiplier - for whom the project's clearly been a labour of love, given he not only self-funded it, but wrote it, directed it, and starred in it too. But whatever there is to be said about the movie (critical opinion is mixed ), its headline-making turn has finally given me the nudge to check out the game it's based on, having languished on my Steam wishlist for so long. And, yup, it's a good 'un. Read more"
"Happy 10th birthday, XCOM 2, the most brilliant, frustrating game of its time","There's this magical moment that all XCOM 2 players experience. A member of your elite squad of sci-fi planetary defenders holds their machine gun right up at the face of some alien foe, probably a Muton, and somehow has only a 90 percent chance to hit it. Still, aim perfect, hands steady, they can't possibly miss, you think. Then they do, they always do. 100 percent guaranteed. F**k you, XCOM! I love you. Read more"
"Difficulty done differently: Cairn and Baby Steps deliver kinder, more generous masocore","For the past week, instead of actually relaxing in the evenings, I have been ascending the gnarled brute of a mountain in Cairn . The onerous journey has left the toes of its alpinist star Aava bloodied; I've pushed the tendons of her rangy fingers to snapping point. With more frequency than I care to admit, I've caused this hell-bent climber to tumble down the same part of rock face over and over again, saved only by a piton. At other times, lacking such safety measures, she has bounced all the way down to Kami's base off jagged, life-ending shards of rock. I curse the game, mountain, and myself with each major and minor tumble, every lost metre and handful of minutes. Read more"

"Don't sleep on Nioh 3's wonderful asynchronous multiplayer, a life-saver and unexpected death bringer in equal measure","Nioh's weird multiplayer has always been one of the most unique quirks of the Soulslike-cum-masocore series. I'm not talking about the needlessly complicated suite of co-op options that pals can use to run through the game together, I'm talking more about the asynchronous multiplayer that's woven into the DNA of the series itself. If you wander out into the 'open field' of Nioh 3 , for example, you will find red graves littered around the area. Each of these marks a place where a fellow player has died - and inspecting it will tell you the bloody fate they suffered. Read more"

"Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined sands down every sharp edge of a prickly classic - making it delightfully approachable, but not without cost","To remake anything beloved is to walk a tightrope. There is always a delicate balance to be struck between keeping what made the original great intact and delivering on the remake's promise to modernise, improve and strengthen. It's such a hard task that one can be forgiven for being reluctant to undertake it even once, but in the case of Dragon Quest 7 Square Enix now faces down this conundrum a second time. Are they gluttons for punishment? Read more"
Mewgenics is an infernal machine that runs on cats,"One of the greatest things on earth is when you're talking to someone you sort of know and they quietly switch from talking about human friends or family members to talking about their cats. It's great because there's often no meaningful alteration in tone to tell you something has changed. Cats are frequently introduced into conversation the same way a person might start talking about an intermittently beloved uncle who's just out of prison. Cats are often delightful reprobates and oddballs. They're needlessly, inventively cruel, or inhumanly calm and forbearing, or they're ostentatiously silly. One will sit on the landing and swipe at everyone. Another will hide under a bath mat, certain that they have attained complete invisibility. They are known by their names but also by their behaviours. Read more"

"""What would I change if we could go back?"" Inside Blizzard's big plan to put Overwatch back on top","Overwatch 2 had a problem. It's a problem a lot of live service games have, to be fair. It wasn't particularly exciting any more. It had a chance at launch a few years ago to excite people, to create a wave of momentum to surf thereafter, but it floundered, beset as it was with identity problems and a misguided obsession with PvE, which sounded lovely on paper but never really worked in practice. Plenty of good work was done since on the game but most people outside of Overwatch 2 don't care - or don't know, because they're not looking anymore. They've moved on, they're playing other things. Incremental updates weren't enough to turn their heads. As far as many people were concerned, Overwatch 2 was yesterday's news, been and gone. How, then, does Blizzard make people care again?

Nioh 3 review,"The Nioh series isn't exactly known for its nuance: there is good and evil, strong and weak, and little in-between. From feuding clans to the machinations of political elites, this binary is at the heart of everything in Team Ninja's pseudo-historical canon. Nioh 3 takes this black-and-white worldview and applies it to the feuding Tokugawa brothers at the start of the Seventeenth Century. Your character, Takechiyo, is good: noble, just, proper . Your brother, a bitter little rat tempted by ancient powers beyond his understanding (of course), is evil. His desire for power and notoriety is so distinct, in fact, that it has somehow summoned a supernatural 'crucible' from the darkest reaches of space-time, and this consuming chaos is so profound, it has managed to seep into four major eras of Japanese history. Uh oh! Read more"

Switch 2's Virtual Boy offering is alarmingly accurate and an essential history lesson,"Under a year ago, I purchased a Virtual Boy. I did so for two reasons: the first was to fill a curious little gap in my video game collection. The second and main reason was in service of a stupid joke: Nintendo had told us that there'd be no Switch 2 consoles for media ahead of launch day, and so in order to have a 'day one review', I decided to review another Nintendo portable. It was an expensive gag. Read more"

"As Highguard stumbles out the gate after weeks of criticism, are we being too hard on live service games?","Highguard's launch this week would've probably passed by largely unremarked if it wasn't for its appearance at last year's The Game Awards .

After that, even as hard facts on the game remained scarce, it continued to draw scorn, purely for the sin - or so it seemed - of being yet another live-service game. There's plenty more to say on Highguard specifically now it's out, but its arrival this week got us talking about the live service curse - the intense skepticism and innate ill-will that seems to accompany every announcement of a new contender, even before they've had a chance to prove themselves.

On the Helldivers Discord channel, Jorjani wrote the following message in binary code: ""01011001 01101111 01110101 00100111 01110010 01100101 00100000 01100111 01101111 01101110 01101110 01100001 00100000 01110011 01101000 01101001 01110100 00100000 01111001 01101111 01110101 01110010 00100000 01110000 01100001 01101110 01110100 01110011.""

Yazuka Kiwami 3 Director Defends Casting Alleged Sexual Assaulter,"Yazuka Kiwami 3 director Ryosuke Horii justified the controversial casting of actor Teruyuki Kagawa as Goh Hamazaki in a recent interview, saying, ""We tried to think of someone who makes you go, 'This guy's a creep.'"" Horii spoke to Japanese outlet GAME Watch (independently translated by IGN ) about the casting, which has drawn criticism because Kagawa has been accused of sexual assault. Horii said the team made their decision based on what performance they would most like to see in the game. ""Hamazaki is a sleazy, persistent, and militant yakuza, right?"" Horii said. ""Since he isn't an explosive character like Kanda, when we tried to think of someone who makes you go, 'This guy's a creep,' naturally it was Kagawa--that was the main factor. Kagawa's acting is fun to watch. Even when he's chopping a pig's feet off with a chef's knife, it has a slimy feel. That feeling permeates his performance, so it brings a freshness to the scene and made it feel really fun."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Fallout Actor Was ""Just As Surprised As Everyone Else"" By The Finale's Shocking Reveal","Fallout season two recently wrapped and while the first season eased viewers into the dystopian wasteland created by Bethesda's video games, the show's second season dove deeper into the world in unexpected ways. From introducing the highly popular location of New Vegas, to bringing in popular factions such as Caesar’s Legion and the NCR and introducing some of the game’s strangest creatures, season two felt like an expansion in all the right ways. Yet this wasn't all Fallout season two accomplished; season two also laid the foundation for the franchise going forward by introducing a location new to the franchise: Colorado. Recently I was given the opportunity to travel to Las Vegas to sit down with the cast and crew to talk about this season’s biggest reveals and what’s next for Fallout in season three. One of the most satisfying elements this season was getting status updates on factions such as the Legion and the NCR post-Fallout: New Vegas, which last saw them squaring off in a faction war known as The Battle for the Hoover Dam. The show sets up perhaps the largest faction war the franchise has ever seen, with all these forces marching onto the New Vegas strip for an all-out war. Showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet had this to say about what viewers can expect to see during the incoming conflict: “It’s interesting that a lot of these factions have been sort of dormant. One thing we talk about as a show is our excitement to see new civilization start to blossom again. But whose version will flourish in Vegas now that the Deathclaws are gone? It’s a big question that we hope fans are as curious about as we are.” Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Chappell Roan Brought Pride Back To Fortnite,"When Chappell Roan took her place as Fortnite Festival's latest headlining artist on Thursday, the Rainbow Royale section of the Fortnite item shop also popped up, offering a set of free Pride-related cosmetics as well as some paid items, like the Maizy skin. The appearance of the Rainbow Royale section is actually a big deal, because Fortnite did not hold any recognition of Pride in 2025. This marks the first time Rainbow Royale shop section has popped up since September 2024. For those who haven't seen this part of the shop before, the Rainbow Royale section includes several free sprays and emoticons, a free jam track, a free rainbow weapon wrap, and a free rainbow emote. Folks with V-Bucks to burn can grab the Prismatic Pride bundle featuring the Maizy skin and some rainbow accessories for 1,500 V-Bucks (abut $13). Fortnite skipping Pride became a hot topic late in 2024, as fans speculated that Epic may have been taking an anti-diversity stance in response to the election of Donald Trump to the US presidency. Considering Rainbow Royale had been an annual thing for several years in a row, and how effusive the Trump administration has been with its frequently racist and anti-LGBTQIA+ rhetoric, even we couldn't help but see a connection . Epic told GameSpot in October that ""We missed the Rainbow Royale window while we focused on shipping other activations and modes."" But it's unclear how or why work on new modes would interfere with bringing back existing shop sections and items that have been in the game for years. The contents of this shop section have remained unchanged since 2022. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Tomb Raider: Sophie Turner Does Her Own Stunt In New BTS Lara Croft Pics,"Earlier this year, Prime Video shared a first look at Game of Thrones' Sophie Turner as the new Lara Croft from the upcoming Tomb Raider series. Now, Turner has been spotted behind thescenes doing a stunt worthy of Lara herself. The Daily Mail has published numerous photos of Turner in costume as Lara Croft while performing a parachute stunt for the show. For this particular scene, Turner was wearing full-body tactical gear that would have made it easier for a stunt person to fill in for her. Instead, she's there on set doing it herself. The @DailyMail has published 12 photos from the set of Amazon Prime Video’s Tomb Raider series, also showing Sophie Turner as Lara Croft in tactical gear during the filming of a parachute-landing scene! 🪂 pic.twitter.com/zFEFhVUMxg — Infinity Tomb Raider (@infinityTRaider) February 6, 2026 During an interview in January, Turner noted that she underwent extensive physical training in order to believably portray the video game heroine previously played by Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander on the big screen.

Yoshi Eats Kamek And Blasts Into Space In Trippy New Super Mario Galaxy Teaser,"Nintendo and Illumination are clearly delving deeper into Super Mario lore with the latest Super Mario Galaxy Movie trailer. The footage leans hard into Super Mario Galaxy-style visuals to show this isn't just more Mushroom Kingdom shenanigans. We have warp-star travel ripped straight from the Wii classics, as well as the mysterious Rosalina stepping into the spotlight--all building hype for the film's April 1 release. It delivers trippy moments like Yoshi eating Kamek and more of Bowser Jr.'s chaotic gremlin energy, all the while Mario and Luigi join up with new alliances, fend off new rivalries, and explore a much bigger cosmic playground. All of this builds on the massive success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which became one of the biggest animated movies of all time, grossing more than $1.3 billion worldwide and breaking records for video game adaptations . Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Overwatch's New Hero Jetpack Cat Has A Legendary Voice Actor Purr-Forming The Meows,"Jennifer Hale--most famously known for Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect trilogy--has been confirmed to voice Jetpack Cat in Overwatch . The flying feline is one of five new heroes coming to the game on February 10 for The Reign of Talon, Season 1. The Express Tribune reported that Hale will be providing the meows for Jetpack Cat in the newly renamed game, which is now just Overwatch by ditching the 2 . The title change is part of a major overhaul of the online FPS. As for Hale (who also voices Ashe in the game), Overwatch audio and technical director Scott Lawson stated that ""she did an incredible job, and working with it was so much fun."" On X , Hale also expressed her excitement about voicing Jetpack Cat. The support character can heal and tow allies from the sky, thanks to the obvious jetpack. As for Jetpack Cat's ultimate ability, called Catnapper, the hero can plunge down to disrupt opponents, then tether one to throw off a ledge, for instance. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Code Vein 2 Dev Promises Swift Improvements For The Game,"Code Vein 2 hit PlayStation 5, Xbox series X|S, and PC at the end of January, and so far, the response hasn't been everything that Bandai Namco had hoped for after a seven-year gap between games. The publisher has now acknowledged that Code Vein 2 needs a major tuneup to address its issues, and Bandai Namco wants players to know that those fixes are on the way. In a message shared on social media , Bandai Namco said the dev team is ""committed to improving the game for a better experience"" before promising to make ""major adjustments"" to Code Vein 2 in the near future.

"Pokemon Pinball Machines Announced, And They're Super-Expensive","Stern Pinball has announced that an official Pokemon pinball table is on the way, but you'll need some deep pockets to buy one. While the company hasn't revealed what the table will look like, it has set a price for these expensive machines and a ""coming soon"" release window. According to Stern , the Pro model will cost $6,999, the Premium table is priced at $9,699, and a limited-edition model is an eye-watering $12,999. Of these, only 750 are being made, and if it's anything like Stern's other ultra-limited pinball machines, it'll have some sort of gimmick to justify its price. For example, the company released a $13,000 John Wick-themed pinball table in 2024 that looked great, featured various interactive elements inspired by the movies, and included pieces of Wick’s iconic suits. Could it be that Stern has cracked the genetic code of the animal kingdom and has bred real-life Pikachus to act as an eternal power source for this table? We'll have to wait and see.

A Very Unexpected Remaster Calls Back To The Pre-Fortnite IP Onslaught,"Remasters are inherently nostalgic, attempting to evoke a certain feel and mood again years after the original release. Few of them, however, symbolize a time capsule as much as Poker Night at the Inventory. The concept of sitting down characters from four different franchises at the same poker table was novel in 2010. Now, after the likes of Fortnite have fostered an ever-increasing IP onslaught, bringing back such an oddity of a crossover makes for a significant contrast. Poker Night at the Inventory was born as a spiritual successor to Telltale Texas Hold'em. At the time, Telltale Games CEO Dan Conners said the concept grew out of an idea from employees who wondered what video game characters do when they're not ""on the clock."" This led to Telltale picking up stars from existing licensed series it had adapted as episodic games--Max from Sam & Max and Strong Bad from Homestar Runner--and pitting them against Tycho from webcomic Penny Arcade and The Heavy from Valve's Team Fortress 2. Having characters from completely different backgrounds and series bantering with each other was the main selling point. Alongside the bizarre premise, the particular selection also converged PC and online culture fandoms that were quite vivid in the early 2010s. Considering this 13-year-old video compilation of jokes and trash talk between the cast has accrued 2.3 million views, it's safe to assume there has been some lingering fondness over the years--especially considering the game was delisted in 2019.

Fortnite Season 2 Delayed After Game Becomes Increasingly Unstable,"Epic Games has decided it needs a little more time to get Fortnite working right again before we move onto Chapter 7 Season 2. The two-week delay was announced a day after the latest game update caused hitching and crashes when loading into the lobby or readying up for a match, the latest in a series of stability issues that have plagued Fortnite over the past month. Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 2 is now scheduled to begin on March 19. We’re taking one more fortnite for next season - CH7S2 drops March 19 *opens the loot vault & starts cooking* pic.twitter.com/ilQCpXiD3S — Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) February 6, 2026 This rash of stability issues seemed to begin when the South Park collaboration event started on January 9. That update caused the UI in the game lobby to hitch every time a player did pretty much anything--emoting, choosing game modes, browsing the locker, etc. Those issues appeared to be solved with the update on January 22, but that patch caused new issues like game crashes and UI lag in matches, and it required both an extra round of emergency maintenance and a bonus game update to deal with the problems it introduced.

You Can Play A Mario Tennis Fever Demo If You Brave The Outdoors To A Store,"Nintendo just put out a demo for Mario Tennis Fever, which launches on Nintendo Switch 2 next week--but you can't download it from the eShop. Instead, you'll have to venture to a brick-and-mortar store, which might be a lot to ask for anyone in the United States still experiencing below-freezing temperatures . Be sure not to get an actual fever from running out to your local retailer. According to Nintendo , the Mario Tennis Fever demo is playable on kiosks at select Best Buy, GameStop, Target, and Walmart locations. With no guarantee that your store might have the demo, it's best to contact them directly to check beforehand. Naturally, disappointed replies followed Nintendo's announcement, pointing out that the previous Mario Tennis game, Mario Tennis Aces for Switch, got an online tournament demo before the game's release in June 2018.

Insomniac's Wolverine Tease Has Fans Convinced Daredevil Is Coming,"Insomniac Games may have just quietly hinted at a surprise Marvel crossover, and fans think Daredevil could be leaping into Marvel's Wolverine . The PlayStation studio behind the hugely successful Spider-Man games recently shared a cheeky social media post that's sparked speculation the lawyer-by-day, superhero-by-night hero might finally be gearing up for a comeback alongside Logan. The tease came via a Twitter post showing Wolverine extending his claws and turning toward an unseen figure, paired with the caption: ""'Claws?' What's that, some kind of fancy lawyer lingo?"" ""Claws""? What's that, some kind of fancy lawyer lingo? #WolverinePS5 pic.twitter.com/vgw9Od8jHO — Insomniac Games (@insomniacgames) February 5, 2026 The joke hinges on a pun between Wolverine's blades and legal ""clauses,"" immediately pointing fans toward Marvel's most famous attorney, Matt Murdock.

Priced at $300, these five variants feature colors that were officially prototyped for the original Nintendo 64, but were never released.

The House Of The Dead Movie Casts Superman Actor As Its Lead,"Development on Paul W.S.

Baldur's Gate 3 Director Shares Optimistic Note About HBO Show As Fanbase Raises Alarms,"Fan reactions to an HBO adaptation of Baldur's Gate 3 have been apprehensive at best, but Larian Studios boss and game director Swen Vincke offered a diplomatic and hopeful message regarding the announcement. In an X post, Vincke reminisced about the development of Baldur's Gate 3's story, adding that he believes the game's developers will find the news ""cool"" and that showrunner Craig Mazin contacted Larian to discuss the adaptation. The HBO show will depict events that occur after the video game, and fan concerns stem from the fact that there are several possible endings that the show can pick up from. Vincke wrote on X: ""The endings of BG3 were created so they could serve as narrative soil for new adventures. There's plenty of directions they could go. I'm eager to find out which ones Craig and his team will pick. He's reached out for a chat, so we'll have the opportunity to tell him our thoughts."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"

The Next-Gen Xbox Could Feature A Big Change From The Norm,"The launch window for the next generation of consoles is still unknown, but when it happens, Epic Games plans to have its store on one of the major systems on ""day one."" According to Epic's Steve Allison, Microsoft has already conveyed that the Epic Games Store is welcome on the new Xbox console. ""We definitely plan to be on the new hardware for Xbox,"" Allison told Game File . ""Because, unless their policy or stance on it changes, they are telling us they're going to welcome that. And we're going be there, like, on day one. That will probably require us to build in whatever their requirements are, some sort of software to support that."" If that goes forward, it could change the fundamental way that console players purchase digital games. PC gamers are able to use any digital marketplace, but Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have their own proprietary gaming outlets. It's been a closed ecosystem through the current console generation. Adding Epic Games Store to the next Xbox would essentially be inviting players to spend money at a rival to the Xbox store that would have otherwise gone to Microsoft. It could also lead to pricing wars, if games available on both storefronts are cheaper on the other outlet. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Diablo 4 Next Class Looks To Have Leaked, And It's The Opposite Of Paladin","The second playable class coming in Diablo 4's Lord of Hatred expansion looks to have leaked, revealing a new spellcaster class never-before-seen in the series. A datamine of the Diablo 4 Season 12 public test realm (via Reddit ) has revealed files that make reference to a Warlock class. Complementing those file names is also datamined artwork that shows a dark spellcaster class alongside Lord of Hatred's other (already playable) class, the Paladin . Not much else is known about the Warlock, but the leaked artwork shows a man holding a sinister-looking sword and harnessing some evil-looking-red magic to conjure a massive demonic fist. Assuming Warlock is the new class, it will join a growing roster of recent classes that have never been featured in a previous Diablo game. Previous new additions include the Vessel of Hatred expansion's Spiritborn class and classes like the Blood Knight and Tempest from Blizzard's free-to-play mobile spin-off Diablo Immortal .

"Highguard Gets Another Major Update With New Hero, New Map, Ranked Mode, And More","To say Highguard has had a rocky start would be putting it lightly, but studio Wildlight Entertainment is not giving up on its embattled multiplayer shooter so easily. The first of Highguard's major planned updates drops on February 2, less than two weeks after the game launched, bringing with it a new map, new playable Warden, a ranked mode, and plenty more. The Season 2 update was revealed at launch as part of Highguard's ambitious 2026 roadmap , and Wildlight has it ready to go right at the start of its promised update window. The biggest new addition in this update is new Warden Ekon, who joins the eight Wardens already on Highguard's roster. Instead of riding a mount into battle, Ekon is a shapeshifter who turns into a powerful direwolf, boasting higher speed than any of the game's mounts in order to run down mounted enemies. If you want to get wolfy without Ekon, Highguard has also added a brand-new wolf mount available for free to all players.

Nioh 3 - How To Get Summoner's Candles And How To Use Them,"Nioh 3 is a tough game, so you're almost certainly going to die more frequently than you might expect. When you're slain in battle, you'll drop your Guardian Spirit, which will also contain all of the Amrita and Soul Cores you've obtained since last visiting a shrine.

Saving them for the right moments, though, can make a world of difference and keep you from losing potentially hours of your hard-earned progression.

How Long To Beat Nioh 3,"The Nioh franchise has long been among the most punishing yet rewarding entries in the Soulslike genre, and Nioh 3 doesn't mess too much with that formula.

Assassin's Creed Multiplayer Game Reportedly Canceled,"Last month, Ubisoft announced significant cuts and the cancellation of six games, including the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake . At the time, there were no indications that Assassin's Creed franchise was in danger of losing any games in development, but a new report indicates that Assassin's Creed multiplayer game has now been canceled as well. According to French gaming site Origami , the project in question was given the codename Assassin's Creed League, and it would have allowed up to four players to work together on assassinations. AC League reportedly grew out of DLC originally created for Assassin's Creed Shadows , and may have also been set in the same era of Japanese history. The game was said to be in development at Ubisoft Annecy, the studio that created the multiplayer modes for Assassin's Creed Brotherhood , Assassin's Creed Unity , and Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag . Origami's report indicates that this cancellation is separate from the six titles that were swept away in January's cutbacks. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Baldur's Gate 3 Is Getting An HBO Series And At Least One Person At Larian Isn’t Happy,"All those steamy campfire scenes are about to get a whole lot hotter; According to Deadline , Baldur's Gate 3 is getting an HBO series. The show will reportedly take place after the game's events and is set to further expand its already robust-story. The Last of Us writer and director Craig Mazin is on board to create, write, produce, and showrun in what will be his second time adapting a critically acclaimed and seemingly universally beloved video game for television. Seemingly not attached to the series, however, is Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian. Following the announcement, it was reported that Larian has no involvement in the series . One of the studio's developers took to X to write, ""Imma bout to crash out on main,"" while another user asked , ""How are they allowed to do this if y’all didn’t give them the permission?"" Set in the Dungeon and Dragons universe, Baldur's Gate 3 follows a ragtag group of adventures forced to band together on a quest to remove their brain worms. No, really, that's the plot. Naturally things escalate from there--gods and cosmic forces get involved, as they are wont to do--but it all comes back to worms. However, what truly sets the game apart--and led to it being our Game of the Year back in 2023--is its excellent cast, sense of freedom, branching story, and the unparalleled agency it gave its players; all of this makes it an interesting choice for a television adaptation that will presumably be linear and could feature different actors in place of player's beloved party members.

What Does Nintendo Have Against Leon S. Kennedy?,"Near the end of this month, Resident Evil Requiem is coming to Switch 2 and other platforms. But in today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase , we couldn't help but notice that fan-favorite Leon S. Kennedy was done dirty in Requiem preview. If Nintendo thought people wouldn't notice Leon wildly missing every shot, then it was greatly mistaken. Stormtroopers from the original Star Wars trilogy had better aim than Leon does in the video below. Now, we can understand Grace Ashcroft missing every shot she took. She's the inexperienced one. But Leon suddenly looks like he needs Resident Evil 4's Ashley Graham to come back and save him, which would probably look a lot like this fan-made edit. Nintendo may have nerfed Leon to keep the level of violence down in the Direct. Grace didn't get any successful shots off either. But that doesn't explain the crime against nature that Nintendo pulled with this Leon Amiibo design . Continue Reading at GameSpot"

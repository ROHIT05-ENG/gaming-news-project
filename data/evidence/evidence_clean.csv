Horses review,"One thing that's probably got a bit lost in all the controversy preceding Horses' release is the fact it's surprisingly funny. Its humour is pitch black, yes, and its comedic moments often dance on a knife's edge between laughter and revulsion, but writer and director Andrea Lucco Borlera's first-person narrative horror - his debut game, created in close collaboration with Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione - is a fascinatingly singular vision. It's singular enough, in fact, that it's not an easy thing to effectively describe, but if you can imagine a sort of thematic reinterpretation of Animal Farm by way of Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salo on one side, and a meme-able Garry's Mod video on the other, then Horses gleefully oscillates between them, landing somewhere in the middle.

Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's chatty space marine companions aren't so bad - it's Samus who is this game's narrative problem,"As Metroid Prime 4: Beyond hits storefronts, I'm pretty sure you're going to see a whole lot of fevered debate online about the game's curious choice to place Samus, famously quiet Bounty Hunter, as the de facto head of a squad of Galactic Federation soldiers. Does it still feel like Metroid, famed for its sense of creepy, atmospherically rich isolation, if Samus has a buddy in her ear or - worse - alongside her physically?

Metroid Prime 4: Beyond review,"Taken as a whole, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond feels like something of a composite. On one hand, it is clearly a follow-up to 2007's Metroid Prime 3: Corruption , drawing close many of that game's greatest triumphs and fumbles with a fascinating reverence. On the other, it is something new for the series, structurally most comparable not to other Metroid games but rather to a different Nintendo adventure franchise (more on that shortly). Then there is how the game is built, feeling almost modular, with different modes and moods of play stitched together with visible seams. With all that said, it certainly - at least broadly - works rather well. Read more"

What makes a great remake?,"Remakes, you either love 'em or hate 'em! Or, more probably, you like some of 'em, aren't too keen on others, and are largely ambivalent to the rest. Whatever your perspective, it's obvious remakes - beloved of risk-averse publishers across the industry - aren't going anywhere. They offer the perfect maelstrom of nostalgia bait and brand recognition, meaning they're an easier sell compared to entirely new games, and if players love them, why stop now?

"I've returned to last year's brilliant Silent Hill 2 now it's finally on Xbox Series X/S, and it's exactly what a remake should be","I realise I'm probably in the minority here, but I don't love Bluepoint's approach to remakes. Sure, they're pretty, they're technically accomplished, and mechanically faithful to the originals, but the studio's artistic liberties too often rankle. I admit I'm a purist and grumpy old man in the making who hates change, but I still think remakes should, fundamentally, play within the boundaries of the original's creative vision. A colour palette shift - swapping the bleached-out ethereal hues of Shadow of the Colossus on PS2 for a more natural lighting, say - might add a bit of beautification, but it can radically alter the intended tone. More egregiously, Bluepoint's decision to redesign chunks of Demon's Souls using a completely different architectural style isn't just an artistic choice, it has significant ramifications for world-building.

Pokemon Pokopia is an open-world game where players build a utopia for wild pocket monsters. The game launches on March 5, 2026. and preoders are available now for $70 at Amazon , Walmart , and several other retailers. Players who preorder the game will also receive an in-game Ditto rug for their Pokopia world. Pokemon Pokopia (Switch 2) $70 | Releases March 5, 2026 First revealed in September 2025, Pokemon Pokopia is set in a world where humanity has vanished and looks inspired by games like Minecraft, Animal Crossing, and Dragon Quest Builders. One peculiar Ditto returns to find the land withered, and its only remaining resident is a Tangrowth, known simply as Professor Tangrwoth. Using its transformation powers to pass itself off as a human, the Ditto works to restore the land and inspire other Pokemon to return. Players won't just be limited to one island, as the Ditto can transform into a Lapras or Dragonite to reach new locations.

Splitgate: Arena Reloaded Will Relaunch The Halo-Meets-Portal Shooter After A Rough Year,"After some very public missteps and an unprecedented return to beta , Splitgate is hoping to make a comeback under a new name. At the PC Games Show, 1047 Games announced that Splitgate 2 will return as Splitgate: Arena Reloaded on December 17, with massive gameplay and progression changes that aim to bring the shooter closer to its roots. According to 1047 Games design director Josh Watson, the studio has been rebuilding the game ""from the ground up,"" incorporating and refining the best elements from both Splitgate games while ""removing what didn't work.""

Metroid Prime 4 Has Optional Music Locked Behind $30 Paywall,"Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is out this week, ending an 18-year hiatus between this game and the release of Metroid Prime 3: Corruption in 2007. Samus Aran picks up a few new tricks in this sequel, including her new bike, the Vi-O-La. But if you want to hear some optional ambient music while Samus cruises the deserts of planet Viewros, it's going to cost you $30 or the price of a Samus Aran Amiibo. Players have discovered that plugging in the Samus Amiibo enables Vi-O-La Radio, which enables players to choose the music that accompanies Samus's extended journey across the Sol Valley desert on the Vi-O-La. There is already some ambient music and noise to go with those scenes, this just allows players to choose music tracks from other areas to listen to. Finishing the game will also unlock two additional tracks for Vi-O-La Radio. The regular ambient music of Sol Valley doesn't make it a bad experience, and it seems to be evoking something thematically about the planet's history. The music may not be necessary, but some fans may resent having to pay for an option that could have just as easily been included in the base game. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Hello Sunshine Is A Survival Game With A Literally Massive Twist,"You'd be forgiven for losing track of how many survival games have come out in the last decade or so, and though I personally enjoy many of them myself, it's exciting to see a new one come along and dramatically overhaul what a survival game looks like, mechanically speaking. In a crowded genre, Hello Sunshine stands out. Yes, it's a survival game with many of the mechanics you'd expect, but it doesn't look quite like any others, thanks to its one (literally) huge twist. That twist is the gigantic robot companion you have by your side. The building-sized automaton walks almost ceaselessly toward a destination, and it's your mission to use its shadow to stay safe from the scorching sun, while strategically dashing into landmarks to quickly loot supplies, all while you dodge other, smaller bots along the way. Hello Sunshine is set in a post-apocalyptic world full of antagonistic robots, and if you're to survive, you'll need to scavenge food, water, and materials to build tools and weapons--all while avoiding the unforgiving rays of the sun. But rather than settle down and build a base for yourself and your robo-pal, you're almost always on the move. It's a much more nomadic experience than, say, Valheim or Minecraft.

Just Cause Creator Revs Up With New Action Game Samson,"In 2020, Just Cause creator and Avalanche Studios founder Christofer Sundberg started a new company, Liquid Swords, alongside other industry veterans. Now, the team at Liquid Swords has shared the first trailer for its debut action title, Samson: A Tyndalston Story. It may remind some fans of Grand Theft Auto, but there are differences that make it a lot harder to earn money in this game. Tyndalston is the name of the city, and players will step into the role of Samson McCray, an aging criminal who is facing a crushing debt. Players can steal the money they need, but this isn't like other open-world crime games where you can keep going non-stop. Samson has physical limits as to what he can pull off in a day, which are measured by action points. Use too many on a single job and you won't be able to do much else. As time passes in this world, your debt increases. For every crime you commit, the city remembers and your reputation grows. According to Liquid Swords, ""There are no do-overs. You move forward because standing still makes everything worse."" This is a story about debt, consequences, and survival. Samson will have to deal with all three on a daily basis.

Inside the box, you'll also find a voucher for Horizon Call of the Mountain, one of the platform's most impressive technical showpieces. From a tech perspective, the PSVR 2 is a marked improvement over its predecessor. The the headset has 2000 x 2040 resolution OLED lenses, a 110-degree field of view, eye tracking, 90/120Hz refresh rates, four cameras, and six-axis motion sensing. PlayStation's Sense Controllers utilize the immersive haptics and adaptive triggers found in the PS5 DualSense Controller . It also offers 3D Audio with games that support it. The PSVR 2 isn't wireless like Meta's headsets, but you only need to use one USB-C cable to use it--a stark contrast to the mess of cords needed to operate the PSVR on PS4. Despite its impressive tech, the headset hasn't garnered as wide of an audience as PlayStation likely had hoped. This is apparent when looking at the relatively small lists of upcoming games at any given time. PlayStation itself has only published a few games for the platform, though there are some notable AAA PS5 games with cool PSVR 2 modes, including Gran Turismo 7 and the Resident Evil 4 remake. That said, the PlayStation VR 2 does have a pretty big library thanks to ports of VR games from other platforms. The PlayStation Store has more than 350 compatible games. The library expands exponentially if you have a VR-compatible PC and the accessory below.

"Roblox Blocked In Russia For ""Negatively Impacting"" Children","Russia has decided to restrict Roblox 's access across the country over child safety concerns, which apparently includes the dissemination of LGBTQIA+ content. According to Reuters , Russia's Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media (often shortened to just Roskomnadzor) said the online multiplayer game creation platform was ""rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children."" The communications watchdog accused Roblox of distributing extremist materials, including ""LGBT propaganda.""

Terrorist attacks are regularly simulated within Roblox, something Europe's law enforcement agency Europol had uncovered in a November 2025 investigation. Meanwhile, queerness and queer content, regardless of its positivity, is banned in Russia for being ""extremist."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
You Probably Won't Guess What Just Outsold Every PS5 And Xbox Console Model In The US,"The Nex Playground is probably the most popular video game console in the US that most people don't even know exists. Case in point: Circana senior director Mat Piscatella has revealed that the cube console focused on motion controls has topped every single PS5 and Xbox SKU for units sold in the US for a holiday week. Nex Playground - The Active Play System $249 See at Amazon See at Walmart See at Target See at Best Buy On BlueSky , Piscatella posted the possibly shocking video game hardware statistics for the week ending November 22. The top-selling hardware option was Switch 2 bundled with Mario Kart World , with the Nex Playground at No. 2. Meanwhile, the PS5 Slim digital edition with 1TB came in third place. Obviously, there are multiple options when choosing a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S--various bundles and hard drive configurations--and each one represents a SKU. So one caveat with Circana's info is that the list isn't showing overall Switch 2, PS5, or Xbox Series X|S units sold. US best-selling hardware SKUs for week ending Nov 22, 2025, ranked on units sold: 1) NS2 Mario Kart World Bundle 2) NEX Playground Interactive Gaming System 3) PS5 Slim Digital 1 TB So that's neat.

In response to a question about combating ballooning game development budgets, per VGC , Sega executives said during a Q&A session after the company's Q2 financial results presentation that it will use the most efficient development methods available.

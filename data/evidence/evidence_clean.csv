It doesn't sound like much of an ask, but it really is, trust me. I needed a Christmas Golden Goose, something I could tap into whenever family harmony started to teeter towards a level of chaos no amount of Cadbury's Heroes could remedy - while the Bluey scavenger hunt game is good, it definitely skews more four-year-old, and traditional video games were off the menu.

"Yakuza Kiwami 3 Puts Kiryu Into Ultimate Dad Mode, And It's Glorious","It's been three months since the announcement of Yakuza Kiwami 3 , the highly anticipated remake of the 2009 classic Yakuza 3 . After seeing how gorgeous the game looks and plays smoothly in the Dragon Engine, on top of the newly added Mine Saga ""Dark Ties"", I've been desperately waiting for more content to be revealed, especially when it comes to Kiryu's island life. Last week, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio announced some of the new features coming to Yakuza Kiwami 3 that gave me even more hope that this is going to be another awesome Yakuza game, and afterward, I finally got a chance to go into full island dad mode with an extended preview demo that left me even more excited for this remake. Unlike all the Yakuza/Like a Dragon games out so far, Yakuza 3 sees Kiryu living a somewhat peaceful life. After the conflict with Omi Alliance in Yakuza 2/Kiwami 2, Kiryu moves to Okinawa to run the Morning Glory Orphanage with his adoptive daughter, Haruka. The first half of the game focuses on his relationship with the kids at the orphanage, watching sunsets with Haruka, and engaging in silly substories as a father figure. Although it would seem like seeing Kiryu let his guard down and go into dad mode would be enjoyable, I found the orphanage content to be pretty disappointing in the original game. Slowly walking around the house felt clunky and outdated even back in 2009, where opening every door welcomed a new loading screen--it got pretty irritating, pretty fast. It was a slog having to interact with each kid, an activity that came with very little reward. I remember finishing the game and wishing there was a better focus on Kiryu's life on the island, considering it's one of the only ""wholesome"" parts of Kiryu's saga we get to witness.

Elden Ring: Nightreign Update Buffs Up Nightfarers,"If you've been hoping for some sweeping balance changes among the Nightfarers in Elden Ring: Nightreign , then the day has arrived.

Raiders now have faster attacks with the exception of jump attacks of dual-wield attacks. Additionally, Raiders' attack range is extended when using the Ultimate Art ""Totem Stela."" Revenants are getting more attack power when using the Ultimate Art ""Immortal March"" or the ""Summon Spirit"" skill. Executors got the most love from this update, with increased attack power, guard boost, stagger damage, and reduced stamina reduction when using the ""Cursed Sword"" character skill. Executors also received a handful of other buffs as well. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Resident Evil Requiem Showcase Reveals Grace And Leon Gameplay Differences,"Capcom's Resident Evil Requiem Showcase didn't reveal much about the story, but it did go into detail about how the game will change depending upon which character you're playing, and the title will also introduce new difficulty settings to the franchise. The new heroine, Grace Ashcroft, will represent a more classic, horror-focused approach to gameplay, similar to Resident Evil 2 and 6 . But when players are in control of Leon S. Kennedy, the tone of the game will shift to a more action-oriented style like Resident Evil 4 . It doesn't sound like players will get to choose which character they will control, since certain parts of the story are meant for one or the other. Although Grace is physically weaker than Leon, she will have some abilities to make up for that. She will be able to craft weapons using the blood of the infected. And when Grace needs to shoot her way out of trouble, she'll have a powerful gun called Requiem to fall back on. To keep players from relying only on Requiem, the ammo will be limited. RE Requiem is also introducing some new difficulty settings. The easiest mode is Casual, which lets players concentrate on the story and gives them an aim assist. Standard difficulty is a little harder, while Standard (Classic) won't let players save their games without finding a limited number of ink ribbons to use. That's a throwback to the save system in the older games in the franchise. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"""Excessive Gaming"" Could Be Damaging Your Health, Study Suggests","We're called GameSpot, so we clearly love to play some video games. You're reading stories on this site called GameSpot, so it's safe to assume that you love to play some video games, too. However, we all need to be careful with how long we play video games because a new study suggests that logging too many hours could seriously hurt our physical, emotional, and mental health. In a new study published in ScienceDirect's Nutrition journal and reported on by Medical Xpress , 10 different researchers from around the world investigated the effects ""excessive gaming"" has on young people. Led by Professor Mario Siervo of the Curtin School of Population Health in Perth, Western Australia, and surveying 317 students from five Australian universities with a median age of 20 years old, the study found that ""high gamers""--people whose playtime exceeded 10 hours a week--were at greater risk of dietary issues, sleep deprivation, and weight gain. ""What stood out was students gaming up to 10 hours a week all looked very similar in terms of diet, sleep, and body weight,"" Siervo said. ""The real differences emerged in those gaming more than 10 hours a week, who showed clear divergence from the rest of the sample."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Amazon's Big MMO That Started Strong Is Shutting Down,"Amazon Games has announced that the MMO New World: Aeternum will go offline at the end of January 2027.

"GOG Boss Says We May Get ""Fewer Games"" If Regulators Force Devs To Maintain Them Forever","The boss of digital PC storefront GOG has weighed in on the conversation around Anthem 's demise, saying that there may be a future in which fewer games could be developed and published if regulators demand that creators keep them alive forever. Speaking to Eurogamer on January 15 after Anthem was laid to rest, GOG's managing director, Maciej Gołębiewski, said it's good that the discussion around game preservation is happening once again, but that the conversation gets a little tricky when talking about games that were designed as online-only experiences. ""There is a broader discussion to be had within the industry of what does an end-of-life cycle look like in games--what is a fair end-of-life cycle for a game?"" he said. ""Should it just be buried and killed and no one can access it any more, and people who spent five or seven years working on it cannot really look at their creation any more because the service turned off?

When Is A Video Game Allowed To Die?,"In light of Anthem's recent shutdown , the topic of games going away for good is once again a hot-button issue. Below, we examine this reality in a feature originally published in July 2025. In a July 2025 shareholders meeting, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot made a salient yet obvious point about online video games: ""You provide a service, but nothing is written in stone, and at some point, the service may be discontinued. Nothing is eternal."" He added: ""Support for all games cannot last forever."" This was in response to ""Stop Killing Games,"" a consumer movement that rallies against purported ""planned obsolescence"" of online video games from publishers. Sparked by the shutdown of Ubisoft's The Crew, the movement has gained traction in the past year through petitions directly to European governments. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Marathon’s New Rook Shell Is A Big Win For Solo Players,"One of the big draws of Marathon is the opportunity to embrace the Runner lifestyle. Expensive biosynthetic shells that house the consciousness of a person inside of them, each Runner shell is also highly customizable, and developer Bungie has outlined how players can fine-tune each one to help them survive Tau Ceti. Each Runner shell is built to focus on a different gameplay archetype--like intel gathering, combat disruption, or combat healing--and their visual design makes them easy to distinguish from a distance, so you'll know how to deal with one in the heat of battle. Players can customize their Runner shell using the cores, implants, weapons, and mods they bring with them on each run, and they can also be visually customized with cosmetics earned from a variety of sources. For example, players can go all in on agility, modifying the ""Combat Anarchist"" Vandal shell to be a scout that can triple-jump and quickly move across the map. Prefer to cause some chaos instead? Then you'll want to invest in mods that give you a tactical advantage in the air and allow you to cause some splash damage when you land. Cores--powerful standalone perks--also have the potential to be combined to create interesting effects. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"Steam Machine Has ""Fewer Constraints"" For Verification Compared To Steam Deck","When the Steam Machine is finally in the hands of players, it'll already have a large volume of compatible games with the ""Verified"" green checkmark, with Valve indicating to developers that they won't have to worry too much about the verification process. Valve designer Lawrence Yang told outlet Game Developer in an interview that the Steam Machine Verified badge will require ""fewer constraints"" than Steam Deck verification. Yang added that ""if your title is Verified on Steam Deck, it will be Verified on Steam Machine."" Games earn the Steam Deck Verified label after testing by Valve. Being verified isn't necessarily an indicator that a game will run flawlessly on the handheld device, but rather that it checks off requirements of full controller compatibility, proper display settings, and middleware support.

"Resident Evil Village Comes To Xbox Play Anywhere, But You Should Wait","The frighteningly excellent Resident Evil Village will creep its way onto Xbox Game Pass on January 20 , but before that, Capcom made the survival-horror game available on the Xbox Ally and Windows PC via Xbox Play Anywhere as of January 15. However, you might want to wait before downloading it on any of those devices because the game is reportedly busted right now. According to a Windows Central report , RE: VIII picked up Xbox Play Anywhere support despite not initially being announced for the service, which went live all the way back in September 2016 . There are now over 1,000 games in the initiative --which lets you buy the game once and play it across Xbox platforms, Windows PCs, and some PC gaming handhelds (like the Xbox Ally)--and while RE: VIII is the latest, it also appears to be the most broken as the installation file isn't anywhere to be found on the Ally or PC. As Windows Central noted in its January 15 story, the ""install"" button you can click on doesn't actually install the game. Instead, it downloads a 10MB container that doesn't contain the actual game. You can still sync your saves from Xbox Series X|S, but strangely, the game doesn't launch. When you try to launch it, you'll just receive a ""This game has crashed"" message on these devices, meaning Xbox Play Anywhere has broken RE: VIII's release for now. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Nvidia Ending RTX 5070Ti Production Amid RAM Price Crisis - Report,"The ongoing RAM shortages and the associated increase in RAM prices are starting to affect other pieces of hardware that make use of fast memory. Graphics cards are especially susceptible, which has seemingly forced Nvidia to start discontinuing at least two 50-series cards that ship with 16GB of VRAM. A report by Hardware Unboxed states that several GPU manufactueres have designated both the RTX 5070Ti and the 16GB version of the RTX 5060Ti as ""end of life,"" meaning that no new stock is being produced. At CES 2026, Asus, one of the largest AIB partners Nvidia works with, confirmed stock of the two cards was difficult to acquire from Nvidia and that current stock of both cards would be the last until further notice. The report mentions that Asus is not alone in this decision, and that several other manufacturers and retailers (specifically across Australia) have noted the same for existing stock of both SKUs. The RTX 5070, which features 12GB of VRAM, seems unaffected for now, while cheaper cards with 8GB of VRAM, such as the regular RTX 5060, will continue to be produced. That leaves the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 as the only cards part of this generation of Nvidia GPUs that ship with 16GB or more VRAM, with both still only available at inflated prices.

"Fatal Fury Fans Spot Strange Detail In New Trailer, Igniting Generative AI Controversy","The use of generative AI in video games has been controversial to say the least, but when it comes to art, the blowback has been even stronger. One game currently being accused of using the technology is Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves , as the new trailer for the fighting game's upcoming second season of DLC characters is being picked apart online. Viewers and commenters have pored over the trailer, claiming that the character designs are inconsistent and that certain visual elements contain generative AI. The biggest smoking gun, according to viewers, is a quick shot of series antagonist Geese Howard, who appears to be missing an entire foot. Other instances of generative AI pointed out include Blue Mary's motorcycle missing several vital components--and being a completely different model from what she normally rides--and Kim Jae Hoon having noticeably different wardrobes between his cinematic and gameplay character models. We have reached out to the developer, SNK, for details on the trailer and will update this post as soon as we hear back. If Fatal Fury is using generative AI, it wouldn't be the first game to do so. Activision confirmed that AI tools were used in the development of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 , but it has insisted that the creative process ""continues to be led"" by humans. Meanwhile, fans believe that Battlefield 6 features AI-generated art , and the Indie Game Awards rescinded the awards given to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 after it was discovered that developer Sandfall Interactive used AI-generated assets during the game's production .

"One Month Later, Fan-Made Bully Online Project Shuts Down Forever","Remember Bully Online , that fan-made mod that introduced online multiplayer to Rockstar Games' Bully , which launched in mid-December 2025? Well, if you didn't get the chance to play it when it came out, then you never will, because it has been shut down forever. According to a Discord post by a moderator named Yubari , everything--the Bully Online project, the official Discord server, script development, source code, webpages, launcher, and all Bully Online account data--has been permanently deleted as of January 14. The YouTube video announcing the project's release has been privated, the Ko-Fi page has been removed, and any other Bully Online-related material is also unavailable. The ship has faded into the fog, if you will. There's no explanation for why this happened just yet. However, Yubari noted that ""this was not something [the team] wanted."" YouTuber, developer, ""massive Bully fan,"" and Bully Online project lead, SWEGTA, posted on X on January 14 that he'll ""make a proper statement on the situation"" in a YouTube video he'll post on January 21.

"A New Secret ""Ending"" For Super Mario World Has Been Discovered, And It's Grim","Even after 35 years, Super Mario World players are unearthing weird new possibilities in the SNES game. The latest is an unsettling ending in which Yoshi can actually eat Princess Peach, leading to Mario and his green companion just staring at each other until the end of time. Supper Mario Broth showcased the grim finale for Super Mario World on X , noting glitches are needed to achieve this conclusion. For instance, Super Mario World players might know that bringing Yoshi into the last battle with Bowser shouldn't be possible. Well, it's not without a glitch putting the green dinosaur in the reserve item box--which houses power-ups like the Cape Feather or mushroom. The latter comes into play to consume Peach, as timing is important to have Yoshi trying to eat that as the mushroom falls and then it's replaced with the princess. Basically, this isn't an easy trick to pull off while defeating Bowser. Using a combination of glitches in Super Mario World, Yoshi can be taken into the final battle, where he can eat Peach upon Bowser's defeat. With Peach gone, the ending will not play, and Mario and Yoshi will simply stare at each other forever. pic.twitter.com/nEHGOWnmAw — Supper Mario Broth (@MarioBrothBlog) January 14, 2026 This isn't the first time Supper Mario Broth has highlighted a hilarious and hidden factoid about a popular Nintendo game. In September, the account pointed out that Toad NPCs are capable of stealing cars in Mario Kart World . Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Sony Cracks Down On Over 1,000 Digital PlayStation Games From The Same Publisher","Bad news for fans of The Jumping Burger: the PlayStation Store has excised the game, along with over 1,000 similar titles published by the same developer, in what appears to be an effort to clear the storefront of shovelware. German publisher ThiGames had its entire catalog of at least 1,196 games silently delisted. The company, as pointed out by streamer and ""trophy hunter"" RobThanatos on X, published the fourth-highest number of titles on the PlayStation Store. ThiGames has yet to publicly acknowledge the removals. One quick look at any of these games and it's easy to conclude that they're nothing more than easy ways to farm trophies.

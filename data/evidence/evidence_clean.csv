Is a Baldur's Gate 3 TV show a good idea and does it matter that Larian isn't involved?,"Another day, another game getting the TV treatment, but this one's a biggie: Dungeons & Dragons owner Wizards of the Coast this week revealed Craig Mazin, showrunner on HBO's divisive The Last of Us television adaptation, is turning his hand to Baldur's Gate , and specifically continuing the story of Baldur's Gate 3 on TV. Developer Larian's fantasy RPG is, of course, a hugely beloved game, and responses to the news have been swift, strong, and not entirely positive. Feelings have also been floating around the Eurogamer office (well, it's more of a chat room, but you get the point), and, thus, the embers of this week's The Big Question were inflamed.

"Markiplier's Iron Lung movie might be getting all the attention, but the horror game it's based on is a masterclass in the power of suggestion","Perhaps you recently glanced at the internet and saw the fuss about Iron Lung. The indie horror movie got off to a rip-roaring start last week , elbowing Melania aside to take the number two spot in the US box office charts, thwarted only by Send Help, the latest from horror movie king Sam Raimi. Iron Lung's success can almost certainly be attributed to its links with mega-popular YouTuber Mark Edward Fischbach - better known as Markiplier - for whom the project's clearly been a labour of love, given he not only self-funded it, but wrote it, directed it, and starred in it too. But whatever there is to be said about the movie (critical opinion is mixed ), its headline-making turn has finally given me the nudge to check out the game it's based on, having languished on my Steam wishlist for so long. And, yup, it's a good 'un. Read more"

A member of your elite squad of sci-fi planetary defenders holds their machine gun right up at the face of some alien foe, probably a Muton, and somehow has only a 90 percent chance to hit it. Still, aim perfect, hands steady, they can't possibly miss, you think. Then they do, they always do. 100 percent guaranteed. F**k you, XCOM! I love you. Read more"
"Difficulty done differently: Cairn and Baby Steps deliver kinder, more generous masocore","For the past week, instead of actually relaxing in the evenings, I have been ascending the gnarled brute of a mountain in Cairn . The onerous journey has left the toes of its alpinist star Aava bloodied; I've pushed the tendons of her rangy fingers to snapping point. With more frequency than I care to admit, I've caused this hell-bent climber to tumble down the same part of rock face over and over again, saved only by a piton. At other times, lacking such safety measures, she has bounced all the way down to Kami's base off jagged, life-ending shards of rock. I curse the game, mountain, and myself with each major and minor tumble, every lost metre and handful of minutes. Read more"

"Don't sleep on Nioh 3's wonderful asynchronous multiplayer, a life-saver and unexpected death bringer in equal measure","Nioh's weird multiplayer has always been one of the most unique quirks of the Soulslike-cum-masocore series. I'm not talking about the needlessly complicated suite of co-op options that pals can use to run through the game together, I'm talking more about the asynchronous multiplayer that's woven into the DNA of the series itself. If you wander out into the 'open field' of Nioh 3 , for example, you will find red graves littered around the area. Each of these marks a place where a fellow player has died - and inspecting it will tell you the bloody fate they suffered. Read more"
Capcom Restores Free Viewing Option For Street Fighter World Championship After Backlash,"Capcom has announced that its plan for the Capcom Cup finals and Street Fighter League World Championship as a $40 pay-per-view have been reworked to include a cheaper price and a free viewing option following a backlash from Street Fighter 6 fans. Prior to this year, the Capcom Cup finals and Street Fighter League World Championship were free-to-watch events. However, Capcom's decision to move the event to pay-per-view only triggered an angry response from fans. In the face of that response, Capcom backed down. Capcom's eSports business department manager Tetsuya Tabuchi made the announcement on X (via GamesRadar ) that the pay-per-view price is now $10. Players who own Street Fighter 6 will also be able to stream the Capcom Cup finals and Street Fighter League World Championship in-game. But the free option won't include the commentary from the pay-per-view. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

How To Become Ruler In The Sims 4: Royalty And Legacy,"The newest expansion for The Sims 4 , Royalty and Legacy, introduces some major new wrinkles to the way this digital world works. The main one is that your Sims can now become ruler of the city they live in and start a dynasty that can solidify the family's power for generations. Since the Royalty and Legacy expansion is fueled by pretty much entirely new mechanics, it's not actually that obvious how to get started on the road to power. But that's what we're here for. Table of Contents [ hide ] It's all about the nobles It's all about the nobles A Sim who wants to rule must be a noble, and unless your Sim is literally a dynasty's heir to the throne, that means partaking in the Noble career. Being a professional noble is very different from any other career in The Sims 4, because it's a 24/7 gig. Everything your Sim does can hypothetically affect their status. And this career isn't one you can join with a phone call. To start things off, you'll need to one of three options: request a knighthood from a noble who likes your Sim; choose the Research Nobility option on the book The Duchess Diaries: A History of Nobility, which is stocked on every bookshelf; or buy a throne in build mode and simply declare your Sim a noble.

Humble Bundle's New Horror Collection Includes 9 Creepy PC Games For Just $12,"Valentine's Day is just around the corner, and nothing says, ""I love you,"" like a batch of affordable horror games.

CoD: Black Ops 7 And Warzone Patch Notes Detail Weapon And Attachment Changes,"A new update has arrived to Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 and Warzone on February 13, and the patch notes detail weapon balancing across both games. These weapon adjustments include changes to sniper rifles and light machine guns, as well as tuning of specific gun attachments. Season 2 went live in Call of Duty on February 5, but the patch notes didn't include the usual weapon balancing pass typically found in seasonal updates. Instead, Treyarch saved the gun changes for this new update, which focuses on various guns and attachments. For Black Ops 7's multiplayer and Zombies, the update includes a notable buff for the DS20 Mirage assault rifle. This increases the damage range for the gun, and it also makes improvements to the weapon's 17.1"" Abdicator Barrel attachment, allowing for less recoil penalty when it's equipped.

"Blizzard President Looks To The Future And Admits ""Not Everything's Going To Hit""","This year marks the 35th anniversary of Blizzard, and the company already has reason to celebrate the recent Overwatch rebrand that's revitalized the hero shooter. Blizzard President Johanna Faries is very optimistic about the company's future, but she's also fully aware that not every swing at the plate will work out in its favor. ""We've set a lot in motion with respect to [the future of Blizzard], making sure we're clear on it, making sure we’re coordinated on it,"" said Faries during an appearance on the Official Xbox Podcast . ""There's sort of a reliability that players can depend on us to launch in big ways, launch in surprising ways. Maybe take some zags! Not everything's going to hit. That's gaming. But in many ways, let's understand where we are going--not only as a company, but by franchise, by game."" Faries may be referring to some Blizzard games that were in development but never saw the light of day. In 2019, Blizzard reportedly canceled a StarCraft shooter after two years in development in order to focus on Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Diablo 4: Lord Of Hatred Is Completely Removing Passive Skills,"Diablo 4's Lord of Hatred expansion is revamping class skill trees, with its most dramatic change being the removal of passive skills entirely. As revealed during an official Sanctuary Sitdown on Discord with members of the Diablo 4 development team (via Icy Veins ), Blizzard is looking to make it so class skill trees are more about offering customization than raw power spikes. As a result, passive skill nodes are being removed. Each active skill will be receiving new customizations options to help fill some of those power gaps, but overall Blizzard wants to make it so becoming more powerful is more about finding and crafting better gear, leveling up the Paragon Board, and equipping the right Legendary aspects as opposed to ticking flat damage bonus boxes on the skill tree. In total, there are 80 additional new skill options and 40 reworked ones that will be coming to all Diablo 4 players. Lord of Hatred owners will have 20 additional skill choices to choose from.

Death Stranding 2 Concept Art Reveals Sam’s Lost Turtleneck Phase,"Death Stranding 2: On the Beach isn't exactly subtle in its themes, as the story is clearly influenced by COVID, lockdowns, and travel restrictions in place during the early years of the coronavirus outbreak. Originally, game director Hideo Kojima had an entirely different story in mind, but after the COVID pandemic began in 2020, he began to rethink his approach to the topic of connection. So what did Death Stranding 2 originally look like? For starters, it would have involved a lot more high-end fashion for its protagonist, Sam Porter Bridges, and his allies. Kojima recently posted images online from the upcoming Death Stranding 2 art book , showing off a ""pre-COVID"" look at Bridges and Fragile. Bridges is wearing a stylish suit and turtleneck instead of his usual timefall resistant porter outfit--the look was inherited by another character in the game--while Fragile is decked out in some killer fashion that references her original outfit from Death Stranding.

"Saber's John Wick - Release Date, Gameplay, And Everything We Know So Far","After making more than a billion bucks at cinemas globally--and leaving a trail of bodies in his wake that's almost as high as his box-office gross--a John Wick video game was inevitable. While it's not the first time that John Wick has headlined a video game , the next title starring the almost unstoppable hitman is aiming to be a AAA experience that makes you feel like the infamous Baba Yaga.

The New Virtual Boy Headset Lets You Access Some Obscure VR Modes In Switch Games,"Nintendo's newly produced Virtual Boy headsets can be used to experience VR modes in games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey , according to a new report. Video Games Chronicle has already gotten its hands on the Virtual Boy headset and its cardboard counterpart, and confirmed compatibility with the Switch game VR modes originally designed for the Nintendo Labo VR Kit . When that headset first launched in 2019, Nintendo added modes to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker , Super Mario Odyssey, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate to promote it. Those modes allow players to view the games from different perspectives and even move the camera in VR. This all still works with the new Virtual Boy headsets, although VGC notes the cardboard version is more comfortable for these modes as it's easier to move your head while using it. The publication also confirmed that the Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition still features the VR mode. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Brutal Survival-Horror Cronos: The New Dawn Is Getting A Little Easier,"Cronos: The New Dawn is getting a free update to address one of the survival-horror game's biggest criticisms, allowing you to enjoy it with a little less stress. The latest game from the developers of the Silent Hill 2 remake, Cronos: The New Dawn is very clearly inspired by other third-person horror games such as Resident Evil 4 and Dead Space , but was surprisingly a lot more difficult than its inspirations. Its ammo economy was brutal, its enemies deadly and painfully difficult to kill for good, and its checkpoints unforgiving at times. For many, this only served to enhance its atmosphere, but others asked for an easier way to enjoy an otherwise-exceptional survival-horror. A new update, titled the Temporal Diver Update, is out now for Cronos: The New Dawn, adding a new easy difficulty mode. It's clear from the trailer that this is in direct response to critical fan feedback over the game's challenge, with Bloober including screenshots of numerous Steam review bemoaning the game's difficulty. The update is out now for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC, but will also drop on Nintendo Switch 2 in a few days. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Steam Reviews Will Now Let You Share What Hardware You Used To Run Games,"Valve has started testing a new feature that will allow users to add hardware specifications to user reviews, giving you more information when attempting to determine how a game might run on your own PC. The update , which is currently being deployed to the Steam Beta Client, will give users the ability to attach hardware information to user reviews instead of just relying on users entering this in the text directly. The patch notes don't mention how or if these specifications will be verified by Steam, or whether the information is going to be sourced from Steam's optional Hardware Survey database. Either way, it should give reviews more context when users leave criticism over a game's performance, letting you make a decision over whether it might affect your current hardware configuration. In addition to this, Valve is also giving users the option to allow for anonymized framerate data collection. This is currently exclusive to devices using SteamOS (which is officially just handhelds currently) but will apparently be used to help Valve determine game performance and compatibility to improve Steam going forward.

One Of The Biggest Gaming Buyouts In History Is Reportedly Underway,"A new report claims that TikTok owner ByteDance is in ""advanced talks"" to sell its subsidiary Moonton Technology to Saudi Arabia's Savvy Games Group. The deal is estimated to be valued at between $6 billion and $7 billion, according to a report from Reuters .

How Long To Beat High On Life 2,"If you're a fan of wacky--and frequently vulgar--comedy games, you'll probably be interested in seeing what High on Life 2 has to offer. This raunchy, action-packed sequel packs in even more fart jokes, F-bombs, and grotesque creatures than the first outing, ensuring that you're always either laughing or holding back your lunch--or both at the same time. But if you're curious about diving in guns blazing for a second romp through this universe, you may want to know how long it'll take you to see it through. So, here's how long it takes to beat High on Life 2. How long is High on Life 2?

It's rarely overwhelmingly difficult, though, so if your goal is just to reach the end of the game and see the credits roll, then an average playthrough should take 10-12 hours . Still, for those who want more, there's a lot of optional stuff to see and do as you explore each area. If you do decide to take on the additional content scattered throughout the world of High on Life 2, you can extend your total playtime by a few hours. Heading out to explore each of the game's main hubs during your downtime between missions can yield extra money (pesos) and useful upgrades. And if you're a true completionist looking to fill out the full trophy or achievement list, you'll find things like skateboard races, retro games to discover, and additional one-off tasks to complete on your quest to see absolutely everything in the game.

How Long To Beat Reanimal,"Reanimal is a spiritual successor to developer Tarsier Studios' acclaimed horror franchise Little Nightmares, taking that series' disturbing imagery and sinister creature design to even darker levels than ever before. Playable solo or co-op (via split-screen or online), this nightmarish entry in the team's catalog doesn't hold back on the tension one bit, making it a potentially worthy grab for horror enthusiasts. Still, you may want to know what to expect from the game's length before diving in. If you're curious about how long it'll take to beat Reanimal, we've got everything you need to know below. How long to beat Reanimal Reanimal is a relatively brief experience that should take the average player around 5 or 6 hours to complete. Most chapters are linear with a clear path forward, and the puzzles that stand between you and the next room tend to be less brain teasers and more progression blockers designed to make you work together with your co-op partner (or AI companion if you're solo). The game's more challenging aspects include some occasional trial-and-error stealth and chase sequences--but they aren't anything too severe, either. However, those looking to get the most out of Reanimal will find a lot of collectibles in nooks and crannies around its dark and unsettling environments, including posters, secret statues, and equippable masks. There are even extremely well-hidden coffins in secret places throughout the adventure, which will unlock a secret ending once they're all found. Taking the time to thoroughly search every section of the game can add a few more hours to your total playtime , maybe even pushing things past 10 hours if you get particularly stuck on the hunt for a particular collectible.

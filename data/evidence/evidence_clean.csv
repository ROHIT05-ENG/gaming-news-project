New Game About Monster Politicians Somehow Less Evil Than The Real Thing,"The Fractured Kingdom is holding an election in Cavalier Game Studios' new card-based roguelike Prime Monster. This nation has a three-party system that lets players choose between Viscount Sucksworth of the Vampiric Victory party, Orcs-4-U representative Chopper Badstone, and The Zombified People's Movement's prime shuffler, Rotilda De Cay. They're all monsters here, and there's no promise too outrageous for them to make in order to gain political power. The demo for Prime Monster is out now on Steam , and the cards let players unleash every dirty trick in the book. Murder isn't out of the question, but why kill your political opponent when you can smear their good name and ruin their reputation? Some fates are worse than death for these mostly dead creatures. Cavalier Game Studios is going for political satire with some of the available initiatives, including calls for same-hex marriage and demands to release the nosferatu files. And rather than discouraging players from making false promises to the electorate, Prime Monster rewards them for lying. The more outlandish the promise, the more likely it is to keep you in power. These voters are pretty gullible, and they don't seem to mind voting for the greater evil. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"PS5, Xbox Series X|S, And Switch 1 Sales Dropped In January For The US","The newest sales data for the US video game industry has arrived, and one of the takeaways is that hardware sales continue to slide for all major platforms--except the Switch 2, it seems. Circana's report for January 2026 sales in the US showed that spending on hardware rose by 16% year-over-year, jumping to $248 million for the month. This growth was achieved despite the PS5 seeing a 17% decline in spending, the Xbox Series X|S posting a 27% decline, and the original Switch falling even more dramatically by 79% compared to last year. The Switch 2, it seems, was the savior for hardware spending in January 2026, and it did well enough to offset all of those declines. Despite that, the Switch 2 was actually January 2026's No. 2 top platform for unit and dollar sales. The PS5 was the No. 1 overall console platform in January 2026 by those metrics, even with its 17% year-over-year decline in sales. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

"LA Sues Roblox Over ""Unsafe Online Environment"" For Kids, Marking Yet Another Roblox Lawsuit","Roblox Corporation has been hit with yet another lawsuit, this time from LA County, over the company's online social game Roblox being ""an unsafe online environment that has become a breeding ground for predators."" According to a February 20 Game Developer report , LA County has cited myriad ""unfair and deceptive business practices"" that put children in danger. Posted to the county's official website , the suit alleges that Roblox ""failed to protect children from predatory behavior"" and ""repeatedly exposed [them] to sexually explicit content, exploitation, and grooming"" by putting profits over protections. It also claims that Roblox hasn't done enough to implement safeguards that actually protect children despite public announcements to do so, which does include facial scans and age-verification checks . ""This lawsuit is about protecting children from online predators and inappropriate content,"" Los Angeles County board chair and first district supervisor Hilda L. Solis said. ""Roblox has a responsibility to keep kids safe, but instead, it has allowed its platform to become a place where children can be exposed to grooming and exploitation.

You Have To Be In Japan For This Awesome Pokemon FireRed And LeafGreen Special Edition,"The forthcoming rerelease of Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen on Nintendo Switch is an odd one, as it'll be standalone and cost $20 for each version . This release gets stranger when you factor in that Japan is getting what appears to be an exclusive special edition with some appealing goodies. Per the Japanese Pokemon website (spotted by Nintendo Life ), this special edition includes reproductions of the original Game Boy Advance packaging for the classic Pokemon games. It also comes with a special case that holds three glass Poke Balls depicting the Kanto starters: Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. The set comes with a download code for FireRed or LeafGreen, depending on which version you purchase. Pokemon Center Online lists the special edition with a price of 19,800 yen, which is a little over $127 USD. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Nioh 3 Sees Best Start Yet For Team Ninja Series,"Just two weeks after launching, Nioh 3 has already sold over 1 million copies globally. That makes the action-RPG the ""fastest-selling entry in the series' history,"" according to the Team Ninja website . Of note, the game achieved the sales milestone while only releasing on PS5 and PC, too. On top of that, Team Ninja revealed that the entire franchise has now surpassed 10 million copies sold. The series started in February 2017 with Nioh on PS4, followed by a PC port later that year and a PS5 version in 2021. Nioh 2, which is actually a prequel, came along in 2020 for PS4, with a PS5 and PC release in 2021. The games have never been available on Xbox or Switch hardware. It's worth including that Sony published the first two Nioh games outside of Japan, too. There is a chance that changes later this year. Earlier this month, a Nioh 3 trailer ended with specific language stating that the game couldn't arrive on other consoles until six months after the February 6 launch on PS5. That leaves the door open for possible Xbox Series X|S and Switch 2 versions--especially considering Koei Tecmo is the worldwide publisher this time. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Sony Terminated Fan-Made, Diablo-Like Bloodborne Project, Indie Dev Says","Whenever Sony gets mentioned, there's somehow always an excuse to bring up Bloodborne, especially since a remake or remaster just doesn't seem likely anytime soon. Following the closure of Bluepoint Games , though, an indie developer has revealed that Sony allegedly stepped in to pull the plug on the Diablo-like Bloodborne project he revealed in November 2024. Developer Maxime Foulquier began showcasing Bloodborne: Top Down Arena in November 2024. The unofficial project--an isometric brawler inspired by Diablo and Vampire Survivors gameplay while set within the Bloodborne universe--was a long way off, but the game looked like a promising amalgam of systems that Foulquier believed would make it different enough to escape the Eye of Sauron. (That is, Sony's lawyers.) Unfortunately, when it comes to Bloodborne, no one can escape Sony's eye. With the company announcing its imminent plan to shutter remake maestros Bluepoint Games, Foulquier took it upon himself to reveal that Sony forced him to stop development on his Top Down Arena.

Ubisoft CEO Tries To Justify Mass Layoffs,"Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has attempted to explain the company's recent push for a further €200 million ($235 million) in cost reductions, which has led to mass layoffs and a spate of game cancellations recently. Speaking to Variety , Guillemot said the video game industry overall ""grew very quickly"" coming out of COVID, with people anticipating that the momentum for gaming generated during the pandemic would be sustained. However, this did not ""fully materialize,"" Guillemot said. For Ubisoft specifically, Guillemot said this anticipation for future returns ""led to too many projects and increased complexity,"" and now Ubisoft is making major cuts. The latest of the layoffs hit Ubisoft Toronto, but the team's Splinter Cell remake remains in development. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Game Sales Grew In January 2026 in The US, But Mainly For One Reason Specifically","The first 2026 data from Circana has landed, revealing how the video game industry fared in January 2026 and the year so far. One takeaway to consider is that software sales are growing, but not by much, and mainly fueled by spending on subscription services in a month that did not have many high-profile new releases. Circana's US report said total spending on video game content in January 2026 rose by 3% year-over-year to $4.3 billion. This uptick was driven mainly by subscription spending, which rose by 23% year-over-year. Meanwhile, spending on console games and PC games only rose very modestly, at 2% and 1%, respectively. Additionally, spending on mobile games fell 1% during January 2026. The Circana report did not single out any specific subscription services, but there are many in play currently. Some of them include Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation Plus, Nintendo Switch Online, Apple Arcade, Nvidia GeForce Now, EA Play, Game Club, Humble Bundle, Prime Gaming, and Ubisoft+, just to name a few.

"Ubisoft Teases ""Several New IPs"" Are Coming Under New Structure","As part of its plans to restructure the company, Ubisoft has established Creative Houses to focus on developing games across a wide variety of IP and genres. What does this mean in practise? In a new interview, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot explained how each Creative House isn't just a hub for video game development, but will also operate ""like dedicated business units"" that will be held accountable for performance and the development of new games. ""Each Creative House will have full responsibility for its brands’ development and its profit and loss (P&L), including the development of new IP,"" Guillemot said to Variety . Guillemot added that this new model will provide focused innovation for both existing brands and new IP. ""We already have several new IPs in progress and look forward to sharing more soon,"" Guillemot said. While Vantage Studios already has its own structure, legal framework, and governance as a subsidiary of Ubisoft, the ""appropriate model"" for the other Creative Houses is still being finalized. Ideally, this will enable each of the units to find the ""right balance"" between autonomy, accountability, and strategic alignment. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Trump's Tariffs, Which Impacted Gaming, Ruled Illegal By Supreme Court","After decimating countless industries with his ultra-aggressive and wide-ranging tariff plan, President Donald Trump's expensive duties have been ruled illegal by the now-majority conservative Supreme Court. According to reports by AP and CNN , the Supreme Court decided 6-3 that Trump's sweeping tariffs exceeded the powers he has. The decision--which centered on the ""reciprocal"" tariffs he levied on nearly every other country--came from Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote for the court that the Constitution ""very clearly"" gives Congress the power to impose taxes (and that does include tariffs, too). “The Framers did not vest any part of the taxing power in the Executive Branch,"" Roberts wrote in the decision. ""The president asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope. In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Game Publisher Claims TikTok Used AI To Alter Ads, Adding A Racist Stereotype","Indie publisher Finji says TikTok used generative AI to alter its ads without permission—including one that inserted a racist, sexualized stereotype of a character from Usual June. The studio, known for publishing titles like Night in the Woods and Tunic and developing Usual June and Overland, says the modified ads ran as if posted from its official account. Finji CEO Rebekah Saltsman first raised the issue publicly, asking followers on Bluesky , ""If you happen to see any Finji ads that look distinctly UN-Finji-like, send me a screencap."" Talking to IGN , Saltsman says that Finji has ""AI turned all the way off"" on its TikTok ad account. The team became aware of the issue only after users began commenting on its legitimate ads, questioning strange versions that didn't match the original video creatives. Viewers sent screenshots showing what appeared to be AI-generated variants. One image viewed by IGN shows an altered version of Usual June key art in which protagonist June is redrawn with exaggerated hips and thighs, a bikini bottom, and over-the-knee boots--imagery Saltsman says invokes a harmful stereotype.

""We're releasing on a cadence where we feel the maps are up to quality and we're happy with how they play, the variety they give to the players,"" she told GamesBeat ( via GamesRadar ). ""There are worlds in which we release hundreds of maps, but they're not fun. We never want to do that. We have to make sure that the maps feel good to play, that they're fun to play."" Battlefield Studios has pledged to release two new Battlefield 6 maps per season. This is a slower pace than that of Battlefield 4, a game that the studio took inspiration from for Battlefield 6. Taking inspiration from that game never meant that Battlefield Studios was going to copy its cadence for new maps in Battlefield 6, though. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Resident Evil Requiem Leaks Has Capcom Deploying Its Anti-Spoiler Squad (Lawyers),"With physical copies of Resident Evil Requiem out in the wild, leaks for the game's story and its ending have inevitably appeared online. If you're looking to avoid spoilers , now might be a good time to stay far away from YouTube, Reddit, and any comments sections, as details on Requiem's story begin to flood in. Capcom is making an effort to address any of these leaks ahead of the game's launch next week, by appealing to players to help preserve the day-one experience--and if that doesn't work, Capcom's legal team is on the case. ""Please don't post or share pre-release leaks and spoilers for Resident Evil Requiem,"" Capcom's statement reads . ""We really want everyone to enjoy the game's story and experience as much as possible. Our legal department will continue to issue takedowns and deletion notices for leaks in order to preserve your day-one experience."" 2026 marks a big year for Resident Evil, as the franchise celebrates its 30th anniversary. Resident Evil Requiem is the first new mainline entry in the series since 2021's Resident Evil Village, and later this year, the Zach Cregger-directed Resident Evil movie lands in theaters.

"BioShock Movie Is Planned To Coincide With New Game Release, Apparently","A BioShock movie is happening now at Netflix, and it's apparently planned to coincide with the release of a new version of the game. That's according to producer Roy Lee, who said in an interview that Netflix and rights-owner Take-Two are ""very anxious to see the movie come out"" because the plan is for it to ""coincide with some of the potential new incarnations of the game."" Lee did not name any specific games outright, but Take-Two recently reiterated that the long-in-development BioShock 4 will see the light of day ... some day. A remake of the original BioShock was reportedly in development, but was canceled in 2025. As for the BioShock movie, Lee told Collider the plan was to make it ""a few years back,"" but director Francis Lawrence had a full plate with The Long Walk and The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping. That movie is set for release this December. Lee said Lawrence will be in post-production on that movie until ""at least September,"" so it might still be some time before the BioShock movie gets made. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Resident Evil Film Teased As A Game-Like Roller Coaster Packed With ""Nonstop"" Action","As post-production continues on a new live-action Resident Evil movie, more details have gun to surface on the Zach Cregger-directed film. The filmmaker behind Barbarian and Weapons was given ""carte blanche"" to approach the project in any way he saw fit, and producer Roy Lee described the project as a ""nonstop action"" flick designed to make you feel like you're playing a Resident Evil game. ""It's one of these movies that it's different than Weapons,"" Lee said to Collider . ""It's like a roller coaster ride of nonstop action, of just showing a point of view of a character and an original story in the world of Raccoon City, where it's like the experience of watching the movie is similar to the experience you would get playing the game, is what Zach is trying to do."" Aside from one memorable first-person sequence in 2005's Doom , video game film adaptations tend to keep far away from gamified storytelling. Lee added that Cregger is bringing his talent for composing beautiful shots to Resident Evil, and he believes that audiences will be impressed once the end credits roll. ""It's just that he's definitely spent a lot of time prepping various shots that will impress the audience in ways they've not seen things before,"" Lee explained. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"It's Great To See Xenoblade Chronicles X On Switch 2, But Come On","Nintendo might be holding a contest to see how ridiculous game titles can get on Switch 2, especially when it comes to bringing over original Switch games. The latest example is Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition -- Nintendo Switch 2 Edition . That's right, you're not seeing double: There are two editions in that ridiculously long name. Sure, it was possible to just go with the subtitle ""Nintendo Switch 2 Definitive Edition,"" but the company probably figured that screws up its framework for these upgrades . Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is egregious, but somehow, Nintendo will give it more competition next month. That's because Super Mario Bros. Wonder -- Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park arrives on March 26. Rolls off the tongue, right? We could then express our annoyance at the scattershot pricing for these upgrades, especially when games like Super Mario Odyssey and Pokemon Violet/Scarlet received free Switch 2 updates . But that's for another day. This isn't the first time that the Xenoblade franchise has seen some silliness releasing on a new platform. Xenoblade Chronicles 3D brought the original RPG in the series from Wii to a portable format, but with one caveat. The game was exclusive to New Nintendo 3DS , so that box art wasn't the cleanest. But it is sort of quaint in retrospect compared to Xenoblade Chronicles X on Switch 2. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
PlayStation Boss Attempts To Justify Bluepoint Games’ Closure,"Sony Interactive Entertainment exec Herman Hulst has recently explained the company's decision to shut down the Demon's Souls remake developer Bluepoint Games , citing a myriad of environmental factors from changing player behavior to ballooning development costs. In an email sent to staff that Kotaku obtained , Hulst praised some projects that are doing well, like Death Stranding 2 , Ghost of Yotei , Helldivers 2 , and MLB The Show . However, when it came to the Texas-based studio Bluepoint Games, Hulst explained that certain factors were ""making it harder"" to build games sustainably. ""At the same time, we're operating in an increasingly challenging industry environment,"" Hulst said. ""Rising development costs, slowed industry growth, changing player behavior, and broader economic headwinds are making it harder to build games sustainably. To navigate this reality, we need to continue adapting and evolving. We've taken a close look at our business to ensure we’re delivering today while still well-positioned for the future. As a result, we will be closing Bluepoint Games in March."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Nintendo Explains Why Classic Pokemon Games Are Releasing Differently: ""We Thought It Would Be Fun""","The Pokemon Company and Nintendo made the surprise announcement that Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen are coming to Nintendo Switch next week, but some fans are puzzled by the unusual standalone release of these retro Game Boy Advance classics. While a Nintendo FAQ did little to elaborate on why these games aren't coming to Nintendo Switch Online, the official word is fascinating regardless. One prompt in the Nintendo Support FAQ reads, ""Why are you handling these classic games differently?"" The answer states: ""In celebration of 30 years of Pokémon, we thought it would be fun to return to the ultimate versions of the original Pokemon adventures in the Kanto region with these special releases."" It's a response that largely dodges the core concern of the question. In the FAQ, Nintendo also stated that it ""thought users will appreciate the ultimate versions of those original adventures"" rather than releasing the original Red and Blue for Game Boy. When addressing whether those original versions would be a part of Nintendo Switch Online, the FAQ simply lists every Pokemon spin-off title already in the Nintendo Classics library, adding that the company has ""nothing to announce regarding any other potential titles.""

The Internet Isn’t Safe For Resident Evil Requiem Fans Right Now,"Resident Evil Requiem looks set to end the month on a high note, and if you're looking to dig into the new mainline chapter's gory lore, now might be a good time to log off. Reports are coming in that physical editions of the new survival-horror game have made their way into the hands of players ahead of its planned February 27 release date. If history has proven anything, it's only a matter of time before footage is uploaded to various channels. ""I can personally verify there is at least one person out there who bought Resident Evil Requiem from a store selling early,"" reliable Resident Evil leaker Dusk Golem posted online . ""If one person has been able to get it early, then some others will too, so officially, floodgates are open but it may take a couple days before anything starts leaking."" Capcom has also addressed the leaks and has asked players not to share any spoilers for the game before or after launch. It added that its legal department is currently issuing takedown notices for any content that has already appeared online so as to preserve the day-one experience for players.

These Classic Pokemon Games Are Coming To Switch Really Soon,"Pokemon Day is scheduled for February 27, and it looks like fans can celebrate the 30th anniversary of the franchise with a trip back to the Kanto region. Listings for the Game Boy Advance remakes of Pokemon Red and Blue, Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen , have gone live, and both games will be released on Pokemon Day. The games will not be part of the Nintendo Switch Online GBA library, as they'll be sold for $20 each through the Switch eShop due to reasoning some may find unsatisfying . The games will support wireless battling via a modern version of the Wireless Club, and they'll also be compatible with Pokemon Home. That means that Pokemon captured in the games can be transported to modern Pokemon games through the subscription service. First released in 2004, the two games gave the classic Pokemon adventures a big upgrade for the GBA. They're the first true remakes of mainline games in the franchise--which has seen several more remakes added to the library over the years--and they included new content like an improved menu system and a new explorable area, the Sevii Island.

Highguard Patch Gives Players What They Really Wanted From The Start,"Highguard players have shared their desire for expanded match-ups, and the game's developer, Wildlight, has listened. Starting today and going through the weekend, Highguard is introducing an ""experimental"" five-on-five Raid playlist. This isn't meant as a replacement for the game's three-on-three Raids, but it could potentially become a full-time part of the game. Per Wildlight's announcement , the 5v5 Raids will have 10 lives to players instead of the standard six. It will also take slightly longer to respawn during raids in order to allow more time for generator bombs to be planted or defused. Wildlight cautions players that while the current patch has some optimization improvements, 5v5 Raids aren't going to have improved performance. The dev team also notes that Firing Range doesn't support 5v5 yet, which is why the Play button will be grayed out when parties are over three. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 Is Further Evidence The Franchise Has Lost What Made It Special,"Megan the bear has just informed me that it has been five years and six months since I last booted up Animal Crossing: New Horizons. In the intervening days, the town has changed a lot. There's a coffee shop in the museum now (added in New Horizons 2.0), run by a taciturn pigeon named Brewer. A hotel stands over one of the town's two piers. The first time I visit the resort, Tom Nook immediately ropes me into crafting items to extoll my island's virtues and helping design rooms in the new hotel. These are substantive changes from the base game, ones that offer welcome expansions to the sometimes-slight feeling original release. Yet, these changes fundamentally enlarge, rather than change, New Horizon's design. The game's recent major update, 3.0, represents a further drift from the frictions and idiosyncrasies that made the Animal Crossing series so beloved in the first place. Upon launch, New Horizons was somewhat barren, despite all the quality-of-life additions and feature overhauls it brought to the franchise. Standard features of prior games, such as Brewster's café, gyroids, and Kapp'n's boat tours, were totally absent. New Horizon's first major update, released in November 2021, reintroduced most of those features. This 2.0 patch represented a substantial solidifying of the game's basics, though it wasn't enough to lure me back in. I've written before about my dissatisfaction with New Horizons , and by the time this update rolled around, I was fully put out. Nevertheless, a new update does represent an opportunity to rearrange the game's pieces. After so long away, I was curious about what New Horizons would feel like in my hands.

A God Of War Actor Is Reprising His Game Role For The TV Show,"While the upcoming God of War television show for Prime Video has mostly been casting new faces for key roles, fans of the game can expect to see at least one actor reprising his original role. Welcome back, Mimir. A report from Deadline confirmed that Scottish actor Alastair Duncan will once again portray Mimir, the self-declared ""smartest man in the world."" Duncan first appeared as Mimir in the 2018 installment, and his other video game credits include Death Stranding 2 as the President and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance as the nano-machine-loving Senator Armstrong . Mimir was Odin's advisor before his imprisonment in Midgard, forever bound to a tree.

Gaming Stocks Get Hammered After Google Reveals New AI Vibe Coding Technology,"Google has rolled out a new AI technology, Project Genie , that claims to allow users to create interactive worlds ""generated in real time."" Apparently some video game investors are spooked, as a number of gaming companies saw their stock prices get hammered today. In particular, Rockstar Games parent company Take-Two's stock price took a massive beating, falling by more than 9% today, wiping out billions in market cap along the way. Roblox Corp., which makes the hugely popular game Roblox, saw an even steeper sell-off, with the share price dipping by more than 12% today alone. Unity, the company that makes the popular Unity game engine, saw a massive 30% stock price slip today. Stock prices are known to bounce around in this way based on real-world news headlines, but the sell-off happening today is more substantial than normal. People have already used Project Genie to make worlds that rip off Mario , and it's not hard to imagine how things may snowball from here and invite lawsuits. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

Markiplier's Video Game Movie Iron Lung Makes Back Its Budget Before It's Even Out Everywhere,"The video game movie Iron Lung, which was self-financed by YouTube star Markiplier, is off to a good start in theaters, it appears.

Code Vein 2 Endings Guide - How To Get All 3 Endings,"Code Vein 2 features three different endings, but unlike many similar games, they don't require you to enter New Game Plus to access them.

Metal Gear Series Hits Huge Sales Milestone After Delta: Snake Eater's Launch,"With a new-old Metal Gear Solid game on the market in the form of Delta: Snake Eater , developer-publisher Konami has announced that the stealth-action franchise has reached a massive sales milestone of 65.5 million. According to a sales breakdown on Konami's corporate website (via Eurogamer ), the company provided a look at the success of its various intellectual properties. The football sim eFootball (formerly known as PES) ""sold or downloaded"" 950 million copies worldwide, and the cute baseball sim Pawafuru Puroyakyu (or Power Pros) franchise surpassed 26.3 million copies globally. However, it's the Metal Gear series that's the most fascinating here, as it sold a cumulative total of 65.5 million copies as of December 2025 following Delta: Snake Eater's release. A remake of 2004's Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater , Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater kept the story and gameplay of its predecessor intact while introducing new visuals and mechanics, such as updated textures and third-person gunplay. It reviewed well, with managing editor Tamoor Hussain scoring it a 9/10 in GameSpot's Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater review . And about one week after its August 28, 2025, launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, the remake sold one million copies . Now that's a lot of boxes to ship, Snake.

"Gamers Really Love Games From Their Home Country, Says Analyst","Video games may be a popular entertainment medium around the world, with there being some 2.7 billion gamers globally according to December 2025 Statista data , but an analyst has contextualized this popularity a bit with new findings suggesting that video games are really popular in the country in which they are developed. Rhys Elliott, the head of games market data firm Alinea Analytics, shared his findings in an X post on January 29 . Discussing the concept of the "" hometown hero ,"" Elliott had surveyed his company's recent estimates and discovered that the hometown hero effect bears true within the games industry as well. Elliott cited some recent examples of games developed in a specific country that, although popular globally, were especially popular in the country that they were developed in. Assassin's Creed is one example. Although the studio has global offices and the franchise is known worldwide, those games--including Shadows --are particularly popular in French markets, with the series consistently hitting the number-three spot in the ""Land of the Franks."" The same is true of Cyberpunk 2077 , which also remains in the number-three spot on Steam's Polish charts--studio CD Projekt Red is Polish. One more: South Korean studio Shift Up's Stellar Blade , which is number three on the PlayStation 5 chart in South Korea. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
"Why An Elder Scrolls TV Show Would Struggle, According To Former Bethesda Dev","The Fallout TV show based on Bethesda's game franchise is proving popular, prompting some to wonder if another one of the company's franchises, The Elder Scrolls, could get its own show. That remains to be seen, but now former Bethesda designer Bruce Nesmith has said an Elder Scrolls TV show probably would not work. He told Press Box PR ( via Insider Gaming ) that there is ""something very special and different"" about Fallout that makes it good fodder for a TV show. On the other hand, The Elder Scrolls is a ""standard kind of fantasy"" story, and those have been done again and again and again on TV, he said. ""That's not as interesting, not in this day and age where you already have The Lord Of The Rings movies. We've got Game Of Thrones. You'd have to try to find something to lean into that would be special about it,"" Nesmith explained. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Some Of Linux's Biggest Players Are Unifying Their Gaming Efforts,"As gaming support on Linux has continued to grow over the past few years several distributions specifically designed around gaming support have become increasingly popular. In order to better serve users going forward, many of them have joined a collective to help focus efforts on better future support and reduce duplicated, time-wasting work. The Open Gaming Collective is being contributed to by some of the most prolific gaming Linux distributions around, including Bazzite, Nobara, PikaOS, Playtron, and more. The aim of the collective is to centralize efforts on core component development, such as updates for input managers (for better controller support), gaming-specific packages (such as Gamescope, which is widely used on SteamOS), and kernel improvements. ""This means better hardware compatibility, fewer duplicated efforts, and a more unified Linux gaming experience for everyone,"" the announcement post concludes. One such improvement includes widespread support for Secure Boot, which currently isn't supported on Bazzite, one of the best SteamOS alternatives. Secure Boot support has steadily become required for kernel-level anti-cheat software used in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 , Battlefield 6 , and Highguard , and is a big reason why multiplayer games are still challenging on Linux. While this won't immediately solve the issue, resolving it across multiple Linux distributions at once should make it easier for you to choose one that suits you needs the most rather than being forced into one because of specific feature support.

"Beyond Good And Evil 2 Is Still Happening, Says Ubisoft Creative Director","Originally announced almost two decades ago, Beyond Good and Evil 2 continues to be in active development. Ubisoft creative director Fawzi Mesmar confirmed that his team is ""committed and focused on delivering a remarkable game"" on LinkedIn . Spotted by VGC , Mesmar gave the Beyond Good and Evil 2 update after Ubisoft announced more layoffs, studio closures, and the cancellation of the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake . The creative director noted his team and the long-gestating sequel (possibly a prequel) were ""unaffected,"" while at the same time, adding that he was ""saddened"" by the recent news. This confirms a report last week that Beyond Good and Evil 2 was still in development following the Ubisoft purge . Beyond Good and Evil 2 was officially revealed in 2008, while the original game was released in late 2003. Over the past decade, there have been continual confirmations that progress was being made on the game at Ubisoft, particularly after its re-unveiling in 2017. For example, there was talk of a beta for Beyond Good and Evil 2 coming before the end of 2019 at one point. Then, in 2020, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot claimed the game was ""progressing well."" However, in 2023, Beyond Good and Evil 2 creative director Emile Morel died at the age of 40. Continue Reading at GameSpot"

""It would allow you to go back a little bit into the high fantasy and I've seen what the Elder Scrolls Online guys have done with that region. I think they did a bang up job and you could tell some really cool stories there and make it a little more elf-centric."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
More Developers Than Ever Believe Generative AI Is Hurting The Game Industry,"A new GDC survey shows that game developers' ire toward the use of generative AI in game development is going up. Every year, the organization behind GDC Festival of Gaming releases the State of the Game Industry Report, featuring insights from thousands of developers around the video game industry. For the 2026 State of the Game Industry Report , 2,300 were surveyed for the latest one and were asked about a variety of topics, including generative AI. Overall, 36% of the game developers surveyed used generative AI (828 people), with ""business professionals"" and ""upper management"" using it more than your rank-and-file game developers. ChatGPT was the most commonly used external AI tool, and the technology was mostly used for ""research and brainstorming."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Nvidia Launches Native GeForce Now App For Linux In Growing Support For The Operating System,"In a slowly growing show of support for the operating system, Nvidia has launched a beta version of GeForce Now for Linux users. The app, which is available for users on Ubuntu 24.04 (and likely many other distributions of Linux such as Bazzite and Nobara) allows you to stream compatible games that you own on various storefronts, such as Steam. These games are rendered on Nvidia's servers, giving you access to better performance than you might have at home without minimal latency, with a monthly fee determining what hardware you have access to and for how long.

Nintendo Shifts Blame For Dispatch Switch Version's Censorship As Players Request Refunds,"After Switch owners complained about the superhero comedy Dispatch forcing censorship on the newly released Nintendo versions of the game, Nintendo released a statement denying that it was directly responsible for this decision. The statement (per GoNintendo ) reads: ""Nintendo requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organizations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines. While we inform partners when their titles don’t meet our guidelines, Nintendo does not make changes to partner content. We also do not discuss specific content or the criteria used in making these determinations."" At the time of the Switch release, Dispatch developer AdHoc stated that it ""worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remain identical to the original release."" But after Nintendo's statement, who to blame for covering Dispatch's naughty bits up is unclear. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
GameStop Could Become A Totally Different Company,"Billionaire GameStop chairman and CEO Ryan Cohen has revealed that he plans to buy a company to help transform GameStop from where it stands today at around an $11 billion market cap to a $100 billion-plus giant that would sell more than video games and collectibles. Cohen told The Wall Street Journal that he's pursuing a publicly traded company for a buyout, and it would probably be a company in the consumer or retail space. Cohen has a history in those markets, as he co-founded Chewy before selling it to PetSmart and invested in Nordstrom and Bed Bath & Beyond. Cohen said he plans to speak with companies soon, and said if a deal comes together, it would be ""big."" At the same time, Cohen said it could all fall apart and end up in disaster.

Google AI Tool Let Users Make Rip-Off Nintendo Worlds,"Google has dropped a new experimental AI called Project Genie, which can create playable worlds that can be explored for around 60 seconds. This technology may not be able to create a fully playable game, but it can apparently emulate some of Nintendo's classic titles. The Verge has shared its hands-on test with Project Genie, which allowed the outlet to create AI-generated worlds that resemble Super Mario 64, Metroid Prime, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. However, the knock-offs were described as extremely lacking compared to the original titles. The AI prompts can't deliver results as polished as Super Mario 64, an N64 game that came out 30 years ago. Curiously, the report notes that Disney characters were blocked from Project Genie, as demonstrated when the outlet attempted to emulate Kingdom Hearts. It's unclear why Nintendo's characters weren't also blocked from the start. According to The Verge, Google finally restricted Nintendo's characters from Project Genie shortly before the outlet's article was published. GameSpot has reached out to both Nintendo and Google for comment. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Microsoft Reportedly Working On Building Back Trust In Windows As More Users Leave For Linux,"With the end of support for Windows 10 last October, the transition to Windows 11 hasn't been as smooth as Microsoft might have hoped, with performance issues, bugs, and unpopular features eroding users' trust in the dominant operating system. Sources cited by The Verge say Microsoft is working on improving the core experience, hoping to regain users' trust as more PC users than ever have defected to Linux. Windows engineers have reportedly been set to tackle the operating system's most pressing issues over the coming months, after Windows 11 has seen persistent instances of disruptive bugs and performance issues. ""The feedback we’re receiving from our community of passionate customers and Windows Insiders has been clear. We need to improve Windows in ways that are meaningful for people,"" said Microsoft's president of Windows and devices, Pavan Davuluri, in a statement to The Verge. ""This year you will see us focus on addressing pain points we hear consistently from customers: improving system performance, reliability, and the overall experience of Windows. Trust is earned over time and we are committed to building it back with the Windows community."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Gearbox Lays Out Its Borderlands 4 2026 Roadmap,"This week, Gearbox Studios is starting small with its Borderlands 4 improvements by adding a photo mode. But that's just the first step in the new content roadmap that will take Borderlands 4 through the third quarter of 2026 and beyond. Gearbox shared most of the details on Borderlands' official site . According to the developer, it has taken to heart fan requests for cross-save progression, more endgame content, and new activities. Gearbox is working on those features and the game's performance and stability issues, in addition to planning a new Raid Boss, a Takedown, and more. In February, Bounty Pack 2: Legend of the Stone Demon will launch with a new mission, new Legendary gear, and a themed Vault Card featuring 24 cosmetics and four rerollable pieces of gear that are unlocked through gameplay. It's also going to introduce a new tier of gear that goes beyond Legendary: Pearlescent gear. All players will be able to get Pearlescent gear in Borderlands 4, but some of the best pieces will be exclusive to Bounty Pack 2. Note that unlike the first Bounty Pack, Legend of the Stone Demon is a paid DLC. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Borderlands 4 2026 Roadmap Doesn't Include Switch 2 Release,"Last fall, Gearbox Studios abruptly postponed the Switch 2 port of Borderlands 4 10 days before it was set to launch. Now, Gearbox has laid out its content roadmap for Borderlands 4 in 2026, and the Switch 2 port is nowhere to be found. As seen on Borderlands' official site , the 2026 roadmap extensively lays out the major scheduled updates and paid DLC coming to Borderlands 4 this year. In fact, it seems to cover every facet of the game except its Switch 2 port. It's unclear what this means for Switch 2 owners who have been holding out on purchasing the game on another console. When the Switch 2 port was pushed back in September, Gearbox stated that it was ""committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that. Our hope is to also better align this release with the addition of cross saves, which we are working on and recognize is very important. We will update you all on the new release timing once we've fully adjusted our plans."" Continue Reading at GameSpot"

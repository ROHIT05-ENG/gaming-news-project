Reanimal review,"It's impossible to talk about Reanimal without talking about Little Nightmares . Developer Tarsier's first game since departing the series that put it on the map (part three was handled elsewhere with middling results ) is so Little Nightmares coded it's difficult to ignore. This is a game of two spindly limbed moppets, Boy and Girl, lost in a hellish, hostile world. Play is structured around recurring boss characters and inevitable crescendo pursuits. And Reanimal even shares many of its predecessor's affectations, from the enigmatic opening tease - here the mouldering mouth of a well opening onto a threatening sky - to the way our precocious protagonists return from death huddled together, as if woken from a premonitory dream.

If history has proven anything, it's only a matter of time before footage is uploaded to various channels. ""I can personally verify there is at least one person out there who bought Resident Evil Requiem from a store selling early,"" reliable Resident Evil leaker Dusk Golem posted online . ""If one person has been able to get it early, then some others will too, so officially, floodgates are open but it may take a couple days before anything starts leaking.""

Project Windless Is A Sword-Wielding Chicken RPG From PUBG's Parent Company - Everything We Know,"During Sony's recent State of Play , the company made a series of big announcements, including the reveal of the next game from PUBG owner Krafton. Project Windless, as it's known for now, is an open-world action RPG in the works for PC and PS5 (and possibly other console platforms) that is inspired by the Korean novel series The Bird That Drinks Tears. Some call the books the ""Korean Lord of the Rings."" The game made an immediate splash thanks to its impressive and eye-catching trailer and the fact that the game puts you into the claws and beak of a Rekon, a warrior humanoid bird. The game's reveal prompted a number of memes and jokes, including the inevitable Peter Griffin vs. Ernie the Giant Chicken references. Here's everything we know so far about Project Windless, which we assume is not the game's final title. Keep checking back, as we'll update this post with more information as it's announced.

"Highguard Studio Was Backed By Tencent, Reports Say","Since the tumultuous reveal of Highguard during 2025's The Game Awards, there's been a question as to where the funding for the game's studio, Wildlight Entertainment, came from. Multiple new reports point to Tencent being among the backers. According to The Game Business and Game File , Chinese internet behemoth Tencent funded Wildlight, at least in part, by way of the company's TiMi division. Game File's report said Tencent was the ""lead financial backer."" Wildlight described itself as a ""fully-funded"" studio on its website, but the team never explained what that meant or where its funding came from. On January 27, GameSpot asked the Highguard team if it could share any further information about funding sources, but the company never replied. In the wake of the reporting that Tencent funded Wildlight, a spokesperson for Wildlight told GameSpot on February 17 that it had no further information to share. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Hytale Adds Animal Taming And More In Another Ambitious Update,"Despite releasing in early access just last month, Hytale is already on its third major update, bringing new content and features including animal taming, a new fire spread system, and more. The biggest new feature arriving in Hytale is animal taming, a new system that will allow players to tame some of the game's ""friendlier"" creatures using their favorite foods. Tamed animals can be petted if you aren't holding anything, and can be fed periodically. Tame animals won't run from players, and some of them can also be milked, sheared, or mounted. Hypixel has also added a major quality-of-life feature in the form of map markers, where players can place their own customizable markers on the map, and even share markers with friends in multiplayer. Hytale has also added its very first non-English language options, with Brazilian-Portuguese and Russian the first localization options added. Continue Reading at GameSpot"
Wolfenstein 3 Can’t Pull Its Punches Like Youngblood,"Wolfenstein: Youngblood was one sour batch of sauerkraut. Marinated in a noxious and ill-fitting live-service-adjacent brine, this troubled spin-off (and the mediocre virtual reality title it launched alongside) left a bad taste that has lingered for almost seven years. Developer MachineGames’ adventures with another famous Nazi-killer and increasingly longer AAA development cycles have meant Youngblood’s aftertaste has stuck around longer than it should have. This drought is reportedly almost over, though, since reports forecast the streets will once again run red with Nazi blood sometime soon in a new Wolfenstein game, further backing up light teases from the MachineGames team itself. There’s a lot riding on Wolfenstein 3: a game that has to meet the moment in more ways than one--and can’t follow in Youngblood’s footsteps. Wolfenstein: Youngblood is the fourth entry in MachineGames’ alt-history Wolfenstein series and sets the franchise in the 1980s. But instead of controlling longtime series hero B.J. Blazkowicz in a single-player adventure, Youngblood puts players in the power armor of his twin daughters, Jess and Zofia, and, to its downfall, focuses more on co-op and RPG mechanics.

Logan Paul Sells Pikachu Illustrator Card For A Record Breaking $16.59 Million,"Logan Paul has sold his ultra-rare Pikachu Illustrator card for a record-breaking $16.59 million at auction. WWE wrestler and YouTuber Paul bought the card for $5.275 million in 2021, which broke the standing record at the time. He also wore the card with a custom holder and chain for his 2022 Wrestlemania debut. Paul asked for $1.3 million when the card was put on auction in January . He stated he will hand-deliver the card to the auction winner. The online auction house Goldin facilitated the bidding. Bids quickly rose to $4.5 million during the first week, but leveled out to $5.1 million by January 14. Dozens of bids came in during the last 24 hours the card was on auction, driving up the price to $13.3 million with a 24% buyer's fee. A Guinness World Record Adjudicator was present to verify that the purchase made it the highest selling trading card ever recorded. The buyer was AJ Scaramucci, a venture capitalist at the firm Solari Capital. Scaramucci attended the final bid and Paul placed the card around his neck after bidding closed. Congratulations to @LoganPaul and the team at @GoldinCo on a historic night 🥳 pic.twitter.com/0vpWfzYw9s — Guinness World Records (@GWR) February 16, 2026 The Pikachu Illustrator card was never sold in stores, but was a prize for a 1998 illustration contest.

"Highguard Appears Ready To Say Bye-Guard, Players Believe","It's been a tumultuous road for Highguard and its developer Wildlight Entertainment, and a couple of abnormalities online have observers believe the online first-person shooter is not long for this world. Less than a week after layoffs at Wildlight, the official Highguard website went offline, eliciting speculation that it's the end of the road for the game. The Highguard website currently displays a ""Site Unavailable"" message and a support email address to Code32, a hosting service specifically for video game websites. The error page also contains links to the game's official X account and an invite to the game's Discord server. As observed by Reddit users , the Discord button erroneously led to an unrelated server for a similarly named ""High Guard Gaming Guild"" before it was fixed at some point. While it's possible that the website's downtime is due to a hosting issue, the silence from Wildlight has players concluding that the studio has called it quits on the game after a mixed reception and faltering player numbers.

"Thanks To A Gaffe, You Can Get Extra Magic: The Gathering Promo Cards","Last month, Magic: The Gathering players arriving at their local game stores to participate in Lorwyn Eclipsed prerelease events were shocked to find that rares and mythics from the next expansion, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , wound up in their prerelease kits. Wizards of the Coast acknowledged the issue at the time, poked fun at the mishap with a video from new mascots Squen and Cragg, and today the company has announced its make-good: free extra promo cards during an upcoming TMNT event. Any player who attends a TMNT prerelease event will receive, along with their prerelease kit, an extra Promo Pack chosen at random from one of five in-universe MTG sets: Lorwyn Eclipsed, Edge of Eternities, Tarkir: Dragonstorm, Duskmourn: House of Horror, or Bloomburrow.

Marvel Rivals Teases New Announcements At In-Person Fan Event This March,"It's been more than a year since Marvel Rivals , the hero shooter based on the famous comic book brand, was released.

Battlefield 6 Devs Reportedly Betting Big On Season 2 Comeback Following Declining Numbers,"Battlefield 6 launched on top of the world back in October 2025, peaking on Steam at more than 747,000 players, but the months since then have been a little unkind to the game. Since its release, player numbers have dropped, and it seems the developers are well aware that the delayed second season needs to hit harder than the first to keep players engaged. GameRant reported that CharlieIntel, in a since deleted post on Twitter, shared a quote from an unnamed developer on Battlefield 6 saying, ""Now the trailer has dropped, the roadmap has dropped, we're all sitting in our chairs biting our nails a little bit."" The sentiment suggests that the team is well aware of the pressure to recapture even a fraction of the the audience that it landed right out of the gate. Fans of Battlefield 6 quickly blew through all of its maps, modes, and battle pass at launch before subsequently voicing their frustrations with the game's technical problems and content. In particular, players have seemed constantly vexed at the game's lack of map variety, both in terms of sheer numbers and structural differences--many have voiced a desire for bigger maps.

"Warner Bros. Reopens Talks With Paramount, Sets Date For Netflix-Sale Vote","The ongoing saga of the Warner Bros. sale isn't over yet, as the studio has agreed to reopen negotiations with Paramount. Netflix--Warner Bros. Discovery's preferred suitor--granted a seven-day period for the latter to talk with Paramount about its revised offer for the entire company. In December 2025, Netflix unveiled a $82.7 billion bid for Warner Bros., jilting Paramount in the process. Subsequently, Paramount launched a hostile takeover bid and offered $108.4 billion. Warner Bros. has consistently rejected Paramount's offer, even when the terms have appeared to be more favorable for WBD than Netflix's. Contractually, Warner Bros. needed to get Netflix's permission to even entertain the idea of reopening negotiations with another bidder. In a statement, WBD noted that this new round of discussions will center on Paramount's ""best and final offer,"" in addition to proposed terms that the studio feels are deficient compared to Netflix's offer.

"Switch 2 Price Hike Could Happen, Nintendo President Warns--But Only If This Occurs","Could the Switch 2 follow the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S platforms and get its own price hike in 2026? That's the belief of multiple experts, and Nintendo isn't ruling anything out. During the company's latest earnings briefing , Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said the ""recent rise in memory prices"" did not have much of an impact on the Switch 2's profitability for the latest quarter, and it's not expected to for the current one, but if the costs keep going up, Nintendo might pass that along to consumers in the form of a price hike. Or it might not. Nothing has been decided as of yet. ""If this rise in component prices lasts longer than expected and runs through the next fiscal year and beyond, it may put pressure on profitability,"" he said. ""If the situation deteriorates significantly, we will carefully assess market trends and respond. As for any future change in the price of Nintendo Switch 2 hardware, no decision has been made at this time. Any decision to change the price will be determined comprehensively, taking into consideration not only profitability, but also other factors like the platform's installed base, sales trends, and the market environment.""

Pikachu Is Basically A Ghost In Pokemon Pokopia,"It's official: Pikachu is dead. Or at least that's how it looks, as Pokemon Pokopia will introduce a new variant of Pikachu that has a ghostly shimmer to it. The first Pikachu variant in 25 years and designed by Game Freak--Pokemon Pokopia is co-developed by Koei Tecmo--this version of the electric rat is officially known as Peakychu. Speaking to Famitsu (via GamesRadar ), Koei Tecmo chief director Takuto Edagawa said that Peakychu was given the nickname ""unfortunate Pikachu"" internally, reflecting its ethereal appearance. In the game, Peakychu is unusually pale, has a smaller tail when compared to fellow Pikachu, droopy ears, and emits a strange glow from her body. ""In particular, Pikachu (Peakychu)'s temporal and melancholy feel is impressive. Internally, we called it Unfortunate Pikachu,"" Edagawa said. Draw your own conclusions from that. While Peakychu probably isn't dead, it certainly looks like you'll need to borrow a trap from the Ghostbusters to catch one. It's one of several new Pokemon variants being introduced in Pokemon Pokopia, with the list so far including a moss-covered Snorlax called Mosslax, a messy Smeargle called Smearguru, and Professor Tangrowth, a guide to the game's Ditto who has disguised itself as a human.
